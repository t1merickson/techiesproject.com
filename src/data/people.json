    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><strong>Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</strong></p>\n<p>My family’s from a farming community in Haiti. When my parents moved to Boston in their mid twenties, they had children pretty immediately. At the time, me and my 3 siblings lived in mostly illegal communities. It’s interesting because you don’t know that you live in that sort of community until you start meeting Americans who live a bit differently. We were very “green.” We used buckets of water to bathe instead of running shower water. Our front lawn was a garden. My parents were not accustomed to refrigerators so they became a pneumonia scare in our household. In fact, to them everything caused pneumonia and everything could be cured with a cup of tea.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;At the time, me and my 3 siblings lived in mostly illegal communities.

We were very “green.” We used buckets of water to bathe instead of running shower water.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Growing up I was a very, very inquisitive child. I constantly asked questions, and context clues meant everything to me. It always confused me how people would do things without asking why? My parents had a lot of difficulty answering my questions due to the language and culture barriers. They encouraged me to read more, with the mindset that the bigger the book, the smarter I would be. The older and dustier the book, the smarter I would be. The harder the cover, the smarter I would be. Really interesting context when you really think about it. I eventually started reading dictionaries and encyclopedias, searching for answers.</p>\n<p>When I was 11 years old, I noticed an advertisement on the back of a magazine with the words, “Do you have questions?” I took this as a sign to get tons of questions answered. I ran away from home in search for the magazine headquarter, which happened to be in Boston. Upon arrival, there was a massive exchange of questioning and they soon realized that I had no idea what my address, phone number or birthday was. They sat me in front of a computer and taught me how to play solitaire until my mother eventually found me. My question started to shift from day to day questions, to questions around machinery, interface and context. That began my path into the world of User Experience.</p>\n<p><strong>How were you were first introduced to Computer Science and/or UX?</strong></p>\n<p>Well my mom brought me back to the magazine HQ the following Monday and told me not to tell my father. In our household, the girls were very protected. I was supposed to go to school and get home as quickly as possible. I was not allowed to make friends. But my mom was a bit of a secret feminist and encouraged me to outsmart the boys and teach her all I had learned in school. Staff at the magazine were pretty impressed by me and encouraged me to continue learning about technology. They eventually were able to take me to a place called The Computer Clubhouse while my mom worked. The Computer Clubhouse was a free technical after school program designed by professors and students at the MIT Media Lab. They targeted inner city kids as young as 8 years old and taught us how to use industry level technical tools. They believed exposing underrepresented individuals to a number of technical skills early on, could help bridge the digital divide. The additional blessing was the frequent visits from people of color at MIT pursuing PhDs in Computer Science and Media. At age 12, I played with actuators and sensors. I also was introduced to coding and programed the very first driverless lego cars.</p>\n<p>When I was 14 years old, I ended up in foster care due to a variety of reasons including domestic violence and cultural friction. I ran away a lot and was very depressed through those middle school and high school years without my family. Despite all the personal struggle, I always found my way back to the computer clubhouse. I had all these cool tech skills and loved teaching. By the time I was 17 years old, I was teaching girls how to make their own web pages and remove the proof watermark off photos they had not yet purchased from school. I shortly became an assistant manager at the computer clubhouse, a Tech coordinator at the local YWCAs, the Museum of Science’s technology courses instructor and an IT risk auditor at Harvard University all while I attended undergrad.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;When I was 14 years old, I ended up in foster care due to a variety of reasons including domestic violence and cultural friction.

I believed it was a man’s job despite the fact that I was already doing it. So I went to school for Information Systems and sociology while teaching computer science on the side. When I was in my junior year at undergrad, I decided to take a java course and was pleasantly surprised. I already knew how to do a lot of this stuff. The wave of questions began again. “Does that mean I can code? What’s the point of the degree? Do you need a degree to be a coder? I’m confused. Can you just learn this stuff on your own? Are you not an engineer unless you learn to be engineer in school? Are Haitians who build bridges without degrees not engineers? Wait, what do I do with this sociology degree?” Sociology was the field that touched my heart and technology was the field that stimulated my mind.</p>\n<p>I took several psychology classes and professors really felt that it might be my calling. But I could not imagine humanities paying back school loans. By the time I graduated I decided I wanted to do it all. I took to the Google search engine and typed in all my passions, “sociology, psychology, computer science, engineering, hands on, love, forgiveness…” And two fields popped up—human factors engineering and human computer interaction.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you make that transition?</strong></p>\n<p>I went to Michigan to pursue both degrees: a masters in human computer interaction and a PhD in Human Factors Engineering. It was EVERYTHING. I had somehow found fields that connected culture, engineering, empathy and compassion. And I got to doodle all day to top it off. The wonderful thing about the Computer Clubhouse is that it was funded by Intel. I was able to work my way through the network and worked as a human factors engineer while attending grad school.</p>\n<p>At Intel, I met an amazing woman and Intel Fellow known as Genevieve Bell. Genevieve was an anthropologist and a human factors engineer who focused on cultural practices. That was the moment my entire life started to make sense. I had grown to a place where I truly appreciated cultural differences and empathized with day to day struggles of Keeping Up with the Silicon Valley Millennials. I knew I could help make life a little more easier. I wanted to help design products that showcased empathy. And I knew it was my destiny.</p>\n<p><strong>Walk me through your work and what you&#8217;re working on now.</strong></p>\n<p>I eventually went on to work on international projects as either a developer, engineer, or designer across many industries; from government to medical devices to worldwide leaders in IT. Today, I continue the great work at Google in the consumer operations space. I get to measure my work impact globally. I am also launching a personal global passion project called <a href=\"http://techsocialimpact.com/\">Tech Social Impact Conference</a> in the first quarter of 2017. The conference sparks conversation about developing intentional awareness in product development. In Silicon Valley, we get to see how design and technology can provide social and ethical benefits (and sometimes consequences). I’d like us to share principles and approaches to contribute to a better tomorrow for the next billion users.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Another goal I am working on is changing the way we do research in the tech industry. I want to make that our research takes into account social and economic backgrounds. Are we designing towards the average income in the United States? Are our studies mix gendered? Have we paid attention to accessibility? I’m all about making a difference in this world, and I know I am in a very privileged position to influence that change.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Another goal I am working on is changing the way we do research in the tech industry.

Have we paid attention to accessibility? I’m all about making a difference in this world, and I know I am in a very privileged position to influence that change.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s so cool to see all of the ties to your work from your childhood to now. What parts of your work as a researcher really activate you? What do you love the most?</strong></p>\n<p>I get super excited when I get in front of people, and I mean real people (no offense to Silicon Valley folks), I’m so passionate and empathetic towards the people I design for. When they’re in front of me, I want them to be comfortable. I want to hear their truths. I want them to tell us how we suck. I want them to know that I appreciate it, and I want to make a difference for them.</p>\n<p>It’s one of those things, when I’m in front of somebody, when I’m in front of an actual human being, to know that, “okay, maybe you don’t have the same technical abilities as I, or maybe you feel a little scared, but I’m going to change this for you. I’m going to make this easier for you.” It empowers me. I just ran eight studies today with folks, and every last one of them said, “I’m not really good at tech. I feel like I’m messing up.” I say, “This is exactly what I need. And you’re perfect. I need you to tell us everything we could be doing wrong, so we can fix this for the lot of you that may feel the same. It’s not about looking for a tech genius. If that was the case, we’d make no money. And we need you to keep paying us, so I need to know everything that makes you cringe and what makes you happy.”</p>\n<p><strong>I’m curious to know, in your eyes, the potential of research in tech and what are the problems that we should be solving with research? What are we not doing to approach this correctly?</strong></p>\n<p>The reason research is so beautiful is because it’s data. When folks try to say “This is how I feel this should be designed,” I can say “Well, 80 percent of people we tested won’t go through it.” Or when I hear, “Can these users really speak for the rest of the country?” I’ll say, “Well, you know there’s this little thing called sample sizing. Pretty dope stuff.” It’s just really empowering to influence people with research.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We’re not building for just ourselves anymore. We’re a global society. Everyone is using our technology. There is a huge culture shift and focus on design for the next billion users and I think it’s a great direction. And guess what? Sometimes design requires contrast. That means we may need to have different people seated at the table to help us design. You might just have to hire that super poor person in the village you’re building for. It might just mean spending time living in the communities you are serving. It might mean better design for our products due to diversity of thought.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The problems we should be solving for is cross-culture design. We’re not building for just ourselves anymore. We’re a global society. Everyone is using our technology.

It might just mean spending time living in the communities you are serving. It might mean better design for our products due to diversity of thought. I see nothing but wins when you consider research as a primary practice to help think more critically about the ethical and societal implications of the technologies we design in this world.</p>\n<p><strong>Let’s go back to your personal narrative. Tell me about some of the bigger roadblocks and struggles, in your career that you’ve had to overcome.</strong></p>\n<p>Being yourself in a world where being yourself seems wrong. In the last year mentors have been telling me that I can fully be myself and be accepted. I never believed that. It wasn’t because no one was telling me I couldn’t be myself. The culture just didn’t seem to want me. So I faked it. I fake laughed at jokes, I fake pretended to see movies I hadn’t seen. I faked drinking beer when I thought it was disgusting. I tried to be a bro when there’s not an ounce of bro in me. It’s pretty draining because I would spend 80 percent of my day pretending to be somebody else­­ or I’d sit in silence when I’m not a silent person. There’s some parts of me I just cannot hold back, like when I disagree.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;In the last year mentors have been telling me that I can fully be myself and be accepted.

I’m now about 70% myself which is pretty amazing. I would never have imagined that. And I have experienced so much good because of it. A mentor once told me that the Valley was a strange enough place where I could fit in and be appreciated for my differences because everyone is so different. Another mentor told me, “I don’t know if you know this, but when computer science first came out, it was considered a woman’s job. It was like secretarial work. But all of a sudden because somebody told us women we can’t do this­­ or that— that perceived ability has disabled some of our powers. It’s insane. And we as women are fully capable of doing any and everything in tech, if not better.” These words definitely helped.</p>\n<p><strong>When did your attention start turning towards educating minority communities?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m very passionate about that because someone took the time to show me that I wasn’t forgotten and look how far I’ve gone. And it’s important to know that it also took someone that looked like me. So I serve that truth right back.</p>\n<p>I also truly believe this—if you want to hire somebody, look at their story. The story matters to me. That’s how you find out actionable potential. That’s how you know that you can take this kid off the street, show him a few lines of code, and all the sudden he’s the inventor of a killer startup. It’s about finding folks that are hungry. So I set up the environment, and the folks who are hungry, come to eat.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you want to hire somebody, look at their story. The story matters to me.

At one point I wanted to prove my value because I felt tossed away by the world. Now, it’s about making people know they are valued and impacting the world that way.</p>\n<p><strong>Last question. What advice would you have for young women, young people of color who are really hoping to get into tech but just don’t know where to start?</strong></p>\n<p>Look at several LinkedIn profiles for individuals who are in the career you want. Write down all the things that interest you and the common themes/skills. Teach yourself those skills. Put said skill into practice. Slap new skill on resume. Rinse. Repeat.</p>\n<p>The majority of the things I know came from tinkering, searching for free education online, and application of that education. Don’t believe the hype that you have to be in school to learn new things. Now I don’t mean drop out. College is awesome. Go to college if you can. What I mean is that you can teach yourself almost anything these days. if you allow for a little discipline. What kept me motivated was knowing that the short term sacrifice of taking the time to learn something on my own, was going to lead to longterm rewards.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Look at several LinkedIn profiles for individuals who are in the career you want.

The world is so much better when you stay open and vulnerable about learning through others. Lastly, sounds cliche, but no such thing as a dumb question. Get your education on.</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>So why don&#8217;t we start from the earliest years? Tell me about where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I come from Seattle, Washington. I was born and raised there. My parents were a typical blue collar, working class, immigrant family. They made tofu for a living, and so I grew up in a world where soybeans were everywhere. We sold the tofu to two kinds of customers: regular folks like teachers or gardeners, or to businesses like restaurants. And it was very hard work, working all the time, waking up early in the morning ­ two o&#8217;clock in the morning ­ working to six at night. It was pretty intense, but I learned how to work.</span></p>\n<p><b>What did your parents expect of you in term of a career? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mom&#8217;s the third generation and my dad&#8217;s first. They just wanted us to get to college somehow. That was just a dream, because both of them hadn&#8217;t gone to college. My dad didn&#8217;t go to high school.</span></p>\n<p><b>When did you first feel any inclinations towards tech or design?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was lucky to have been born in the era when the Commodore PET came out, which was a little computer. I was also lucky to receive the benefit of the civil rights work in the 60s. Seattle was de­segregated. The people on the poorer side of town were bussed to the richer side of town. I was in the poor side of town. I was bussed to the rich side of town and they had this computer in math class. That&#8217;s where I found my first computer in the 70s.</span></p>\n<p><b>Then you ended up going into software engineering as a student, correct?</b></p>\n<p>Yeah. It was really my parents&#8217; dream for us to go to college and it was either Harvard or MIT. My older brother didn&#8217;t get into Harvard, so he was considered a failure [chuckles]. So I said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got to get into MIT,&#8221; and I got to MIT and studied computer science there.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you connect your understanding of technology with an understanding of the history of art, you can do something new. When you do something new, it hurts because nobody likes what you&#8217;re doing because it&#8217;s different. I think our inclination is to be afraid of that pain.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>When did you become interested in design and then the integration of the two?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well I think as a child I was said to be good at math and art, but my parents would never tell anybody I was good at art because they felt that couldn&#8217;t get you a job. I was “good at math” is what they&#8217;d always say. I loved drawing. I loved thinking visually. When I got to MIT, I tried to defect. I discovered this department called “architecture.” My dad figured out what I was doing so, &#8220;No, no, no, no, no. You&#8217;re not going to be able to feed yourself, so computer science; go back there,&#8221; kind of thing. But I used to go to the library at MIT and I would find these books on design. At the time I was probably one of the best icon editors on campus at MIT. Computers were just becoming visual and I was the guy that could make good icons. I thought I was really good at it. Then I found this book by Paul Rand, the graphic designer, and I thought, &#8220;Man, he is so much better than I am at this stuff.&#8221; [chuckles] That&#8217;s how I found the field of design.</span></p>\n<p><b>Such a huge part of your work is combining tech and art and exploring the integration of the two. When did this feel like a focal point for you more than just doing the work that&#8217;s assigned to you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s a great question. I forget all the time that I cared about that, if that makes sense. I&#8217;ll be waking up and saying, &#8220;Oh yeah, I care about how those two connect.&#8221; Then I&#8217;m off forgetting everything. &#8220;Oh yeah, I care about that.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess it&#8217;s because I was lucky in the 80s and 90s to see how, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">if you connect your understanding of technology with an understanding of the history of art, you can do something new. When you do something new, it hurts because nobody likes what you&#8217;re doing because it&#8217;s different.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Each time you touch that third rail, you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Ouch! I don&#8217;t want to do that. I want to be a regular engineer. Or, I want to be a regular artist.&#8221; So </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think our inclination is to be afraid of that pain.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I&#8217;ll come close to it and I&#8217;ll go away from it [chuckles] and I&#8217;ll come close to it and then go away from it. I&#8217;ve always been having this problem. I&#8217;ll be in art school, I&#8217;ll be in engineering school, I&#8217;ll be in Silicon Valley. I&#8217;ve always been running from and towards the third rail.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always experienced push­back. In art school, I remember in the early 90s my conservative design teachers told me, &#8220;Stop making things move on the screen. That&#8217;s not right.&#8221; Or being at MIT, and my engineering teachers telling me, &#8220;Why do you care how it feels, just make it run faster.” I think that anyone messing with the field they’re in, and how it&#8217;s “supposed to be” gets in trouble and it goes back to that key question: “How much pain can you take standing at the intersection of fields?” I guess I&#8217;ve always wanted to feel that pain. I guess I feel alive in it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>I don&#8217;t think we have time to run through the entire course of your career but at a high level, what aspects of your work have you been proudest of, and what about your work activates you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wow. Well I think any creative person you talk to will tell you they&#8217;re not really proud of what they&#8217;ve done, because they&#8217;re still searching. So I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m proud of anything I&#8217;ve ever done. I think that I&#8217;m always surprised when I see something I did in the past ­. What I&#8217;ve seen about getting older, is you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Did I do that? I don&#8217;t remember doing that. I guess that was kind of okay, but I could have done better&#8221; kind of thing [chuckles]. So nothing in particular, really. I&#8217;m glad that I&#8217;ve continued to learn, try new things.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Being in venture capital is my most ambitious art project to date.</span></p>\n<p><b>I definitely want to go into that with you, in a little bit. In terms of integrating the tech and art worlds, did people see it the way­ or as naturally as you see it? Like, from a political perspective, has there been push­back from either side, when you&#8217;ve for instance been pushing tech onto RISD, or pushing art into Silicon Valley?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. I think. I&#8217;m glad you asked that question. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve always experienced push­back.

I guess I feel alive in it.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are the problems that you seek to solve with your work?</b></p>\n<p>Right now I want to address the fact that most of the power in the world is controlled by people who understand money, and in many cases have understood it for multiple generations.</p>\n<p>Creative people are trained to not care for money. I think because of this, creative peope—when I say creative people, I mean like arts, design, or even engineers who love to make things—or “makers” tend to believe that money is evil, bad, corrupting, dangerous. My passion is to enable makers to understand that money is just a medium. And like all media, it can do good, it can do bad. In the same way we can&#8217;t say that all art does good—there are bad artists. There are Evil artists. and so money can be used in the same way: for good, for bad.</p>\n<p><b>Similar but slightly different question: What are the biggest motivators in your work? What drives you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To question what I know, because I&#8217;m supposed to know a lot of things. And each time I feel, &#8220;Maybe I understand this,&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t get it.&#8221; Being in Silicon Valley has been so humbling. To meet people like yourself who are really in a whole different way of thinking that I overlooked, and didn&#8217;t fully understand, and I wasn&#8217;t a part of. That&#8217;s why for me, living here­­ I&#8217;ve been living in like a Millennial, I have no possessions, and am living in Airbnbs and Uber­ing everywhere. To understand how your generation feels right now has been an exciting moment for me. I love this project you&#8217;re doing and I love how you imagined it and I love how after you have gone through most iterations of yourself, you came to see this as important and there&#8217;s nothing to stop you. You just said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to do it. Suddenly, I have 500 people who want to be a part of it.&#8221; And I thought, &#8220;Thank goodness that people like you are saying, &#8216;Of course I can. Because technology is something I&#8217;m not afraid of, but I&#8217;m not just technologist. I&#8217;m a person of culture, and I&#8217;ll combine them together and show them.’”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Being in venture capital is my most ambitious art project to date.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Amen and thank you. This is a little bit of a side step, but you&#8217;re on the board of Wieden, and I&#8217;m curious to hear how you apply your perspectives and methodology to advertising.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh. Well, a lot of my passion is going back to the world of money, the world of control. I&#8217;d like to be a creative person who is in board roles who can argue for creative. So on Wieden&#8217;s board, I channel the guy who can talk money, but can talk creative too. The questions always have to be not about pure profitability, but creative integrity. And the reason why Dan Wieden brought me into his world is that he wanted to make sure that all the discussions come back to, &#8220;Are we a creative culture?&#8221; So I like those kinds of roles, where creativity matters at the very top. I recognize that such opportunities are precious, and are meant to be made into something, and to be taken to their fullest. </span></p>\n<p><b>When was the moment when money became important to you as something integral in the design process?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was in the year 2001. It was the dot­com crash. And some of my colleagues at MIT owned a lot of stocks. And we were at a meeting where they were facepalming and going, &#8220;Oh no, oh no,&#8221; because they were losing all kinds of money. I had no money, so I didn&#8217;t know what they were talking about [chuckles]. And oh my gosh. Shortly thereafter, MIT did some restructuring, and I remember there was a CFO type person who said to me, &#8220;John, you&#8217;re the creative person, so don&#8217;t worry about the money. We&#8217;ll figure it out. You just go and be creative.&#8221; And he was maybe the third person in my life who had said the same thing to me. And when someone tells you, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry your pretty little head, John. It&#8217;s going to be okay,&#8221; I get worried. I wonder, &#8220;What are you hiding from me?&#8221; And I realized, I would read newspapers and not understand the financial terms ­­ and the legal terms too. Sure, I could read People Magazine, one of my favorite things. And it’s so vacuous, and easy to read. But I couldn&#8217;t read The Wall Street Journal. And so I did my MBA to begin to learn the language of the finance and business world to get to feeling, &#8220;Oh that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re saying. Oh that&#8217;s what I didn&#8217;t understand.&#8221; Here I was, limited to being told that I&#8217;ll do the creative part, and you someone else would do the money part. I wondered, “How much am I giving away? How do I take back my integrity?” That&#8217;s where this drive all came from.</span></p>\n<p><b>Interesting. Did you ever expect to be in Silicon Valley Venture Capital?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Never. I actually had never heard of “venture capital” until I got to Silicon Valley. Well, I kind of heard of it; but I didn&#8217;t know what it was at all. In full disclosure, I just sort of bumble into things. With the attitude like, “Oh, I&#8217;ll try that,. I’ll try that.” I remember feeling, “Venture Capital? What is that?” Two months before I arrived I bought a book on venture capital. I read it, didn&#8217;t quite understand it. So since I’ve arrived, it&#8217;s just been a lot of learning. I marveled at how a little bit of money can become a large amount of money? I didn’t know it was possible.  I then wondered, “Wait, so what are the letters? What do they mean? Oh, they&#8217;re in sequence. Okay, I get it.” All these things that I had no idea about­­ and just to realize it now in my lifetime has felt like a blessing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve also found that people who find out I work in venture capital will say to me, &#8220;Oh, venture capitalists, they&#8217;re bad, bad&#8221;. I don’t know what they’re talking about. I know a lot of bad people in the academic world – and some good ones. And I can say I know a lot of good venture capitalists – they’re pretty amazing. I love how their goal is to see the impossible happen. And when we think in this start­up, Silicon Valley world, that&#8217;s a kind of a mantra—you know, &#8220;Make the world a better place&#8221; or whatever—I love that the people who have the funds to power these things, a significant percentage of them, do believe the impossible is possible. I think that&#8217;s magic.</span></p>\n<p><b>Tell me more about your first impressions of Silicon Valley.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, you know that my first impression was – the lack of  diversity in tech, and how there aren&#8217;t enough women, people of color, and it’s not addressed sufficiently. I noticed it from the very beginning. But then I noticed that it was because I myself wasn&#8217;t making a conscious effort to change that in my own activities. Maybe in my first few months I met mainly young white men, because they would introduce me to more young white men. And so after a while I realized, &#8220;Oh, maybe I&#8217;m doing this wrong. It isn&#8217;t that the system is doing me wrong; what do I have to do differently?” So I began asking myself if I&#8217;m having ten people that I&#8217;m seeing, how can I now consciously edit my direction. I found that my conversations and gatherings became so much better than when they were less diverse. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">w</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hen people say that diversity is important, I like to say instead, &#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t important. It&#8217;s essential to increase the quality of discourse.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8221; When I was leading RISD, I had the opposite problem because there were ~70% or more women in the student body. So I would always be like, &#8220;So where are the men?” So again, we have to recognize the situation we&#8217;re in and we have to take action. But I&#8217;m by no means perfect with regards to my diversity record, but I do strive to be conscious, aware, and take action on the matter.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;W<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hen people say that diversity is important, I like to say instead, &#8216;No, it isn&#8217;t important. It&#8217;s essential to increase the quality of discourse.&#8217;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Tell me about how kind of the culmination of your previous work impacts how you&#8217;re approaching your work in VC.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, absolutely. I became president of a college in 2008 because I read the “Audacity of Hope,” and I listened to the audio book and it was so inspiring as an American to hear that anyone, any American, no matter what age, race, or creed can make a difference. “Yes, we can.” So, when the headhunting firm, Spencer Stuart, called me up and said, &#8220;Hey, you want to be president of a college?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do that.&#8221; But yeah, I finished my MBA, but I don&#8217;t have any experience, and I was never a dean or a provost or all these special titles along the way. I can&#8217;t do that. And in my voice I could hear, &#8220;Yes we can. Yes we can!&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And so Obama became president that year—the same year the financial crisis happened. Me too, I was brought in as a person who was going to bring in new ideas, and then shortly after I arrive I&#8217;m overseeing the worst layoff in the history of the place. And I&#8217;m no longer a person with ideas, and immediately assume the role of the pragmatist and operator working to navigate a financial crisis. And it was kind of like a sock in the gut and in the face. And so I had to become a different person. And I&#8217;m grateful because otherwise I wouldn&#8217;t have learned how to operate at scale as a leader.  I wouldn&#8217;t have had to reform the business model, or really understand the business of a university, and to understand where every dime goes. That was a great outcome, but a hard process along the way. And so I come to Silicon Valley to learn that this knowledge of how to run an organization at scale through difficult times is valuable here, which I find very promising and positive. It isn&#8217;t that people here are all about fail fast. It&#8217;s, “Can you recover fast?” And I&#8217; know how to recover – it just takes hard, and smart, work. </span></p>\n<p><b>Let&#8217;s go really macro for a second. How do you feel about the state of Silicon Valley Tech in 2016? What excites you, what frustrates you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think what excites me is that there&#8217;s a kind of awareness that maybe we need to make things for more kinds of people than those who live in Silicon Valley. You can call it diversity, inclusion, all kinds of things ­­ it doesn&#8217;t matter. We recognize there&#8217;s a strong business case for matters that impact people who live outside this region, and by knowing what they care about, we can  actually have a bigger impact. That excites me: not the technology. There&#8217;s a realization occurring here in this region. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What turns me off? ­­ I don&#8217;t know. I mean, so many things get me grumpy in general, I guess [laughter] </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">if there were one thing that ticks me off, it is that certain voices still cannot be heard, and I believe that with the fortune and responsibility in the voice that I have, I want to do everything I can to amplify those voices. But more work has to be done.</span></p>\n<p><b>I saw that you started a newsletter recently, for Asian­ Americans in tech. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You noticed that. I guess that I woke up one weekend realizing that, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m Asian.&#8221; It was this weird moment that came to me. I mean, as an Asian American, I try to hide. I try to fit in, and that&#8217;s been my whole life. I&#8217;ve always fought for everyone&#8217;s cause whether it&#8217;s African Americans, Latin Americans, LGBTQ, and any group feeling social injustice at unfair scales. Anyone. Because I know what it&#8217;s like to feel different, but I realized recently that I don&#8217;t do anything for Asian people, and it was just this, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t I?&#8221; It&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t want to people to pay attention to the fact that I am not like them. I realized what a disservice I was doing. When I saw Tracy Chou, ­she&#8217;s amazing – I felt I had to do something.</span></p>\n<p><b>She&#8217;s in my project!</b></p>\n<p>She&#8217;s like Legolas. She&#8217;s  like Legolas with the arrows in how deeply she is engaged in these matters. She made me think, &#8220;Wow, I&#8217;ve got to get off my butt and say something.&#8221; That&#8217;s why I wrote the essay, “Did I grow up and become the yellow hand?” Am I the type­-O hand on the emoji keyboard that doesn&#8217;t stand for any particular skin color or culture? I felt that maybe I should stand for something. That&#8217;s why that began. Thanks for noticing that.</p>\n<p><b>I keep an eye on things [chuckles]. I&#8217;m on Twitter a lot when I&#8217;m not shooting. Let&#8217;s see, I&#8217;m curious to know your thoughts on how Silicon Valley seems to approach design.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, it’s very exciting. What&#8217;s so exciting about how Silicon Valley works is that it lives in the true era that no one could have imagined, where the product is no longer five zones removed from the consumer. There is no need for the intermediary to sell the water bottle that you drink; it&#8217;s right there on the other side of the phone’s glass. You&#8217;re using the product, and not only that but it&#8217;s being used not by a few people but millions of people. So Silicon Valley designers deal with a significantly different kind of design, the design where the product is the brand, is the expression, is delivered in real time, and it can be changed every day if the budget existed. Whereas the old design is, “I&#8217;ll make these glasses, I hope they&#8217;re awesome. We shipped them; they didn&#8217;t sell. Well that&#8217;s because I was a genius and people didn&#8217;t get it.” Or, “I shipped my glasses and some sold. Hmm, okay well let&#8217;s get lucky next time.” Silicon Valley designers live in a world where the thing they&#8217;re selling is never going to be done being made, and is being shipped live. That is an amazing thing, and these design outcomes are fundamentally different than how design was done in the past. And the designers suffer at the same time too, because people who made things like in the old world got to finish it. “It&#8217;s done. It’s been finalized. It will never change now that it’s done. Isn&#8217;t it amazing? It so amazing. It&#8217;s done.” Whereas people who design in tech never get to be done. So when I saw that you were a photographer and you were taking photographs, you were able to go back to the world of “done,” because done is the best place to be. But you have both in you. You know exactly what that&#8217;s like, you know what this it is like for designers in tech. And you&#8217;re still so young, so you&#8217;ll find all these new things in your life. It&#8217;s being in this imbalanced place, that makes you a unique person in the future, I believe. That new person is part of your project. I think you&#8217;ve just started.</span></p>\n<p><b>Thank you.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, this is something. What is this?&#8221; Scratch head, scratch head. This is a good beginning.</span></p>\n<p><b>This is the kind of work I&#8217;ve been wanting to do my whole life, and this is the first month that I feel like I&#8217;ve had the time and the resources to do it.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s good. You&#8217;ve earned it.</span></p>\n<p><b>I do feel like I&#8217;m just at the beginning. So I appreciate the encouragement.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Absolutely.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are your thoughts on the relationship between tech and art here?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s tough. In New York, it&#8217;s easy to be an artist, because there&#8217;s a lot of artists there. There&#8217;s a history of art galleries there. For example, if you&#8217;re in Paris, it&#8217;s easy to be an artist – it’s also easy to be a mathematician, I hear. Here the spirit of art is not a strong spirit, which I think signals great opportunity. And I think people, like yourself, who can seize the moment and think, &#8220;Well, maybe there isn&#8217;t a strong art community of a certain art, but maybe there&#8217;s a strong community for a different kind of art.&#8221; I think that work will be done, and that work has to be done.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even the fact that you&#8217;re reaching out to the world and pulling people into this world that you have ­­ that&#8217;s a different kind of art. It&#8217;s like Jenny Holzer taking portraits, 80 portraits, live around the world. That feels like a kind of art that&#8217;s natural here and can be celebrated, versus old school, like &#8220;Let&#8217;s take a motor and let&#8217;s attach it to a paint can and let&#8217;s make art.&#8221; And hearing a gallery crowd cheer you on and say, “Oh, my gosh. That was amazing art. It’s right in front of me. It’s finished. It’s done.” That&#8217;s not art anymore – at least for people in the future. The new art lives with people. And I think this region would be more likely to understand that. So I&#8217;m hoping that the gallery system can evolve to accept that future. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s going to happen, but it&#8217;s going to be a problem for a while. If you have more of that kind of art, then the new kind of galleries will emerge, and the market will emerge from that. And I hope that you, Helena, will sell different aspects of your process as products to find that different audience and to help this region talk about art in the new language your generation will create.</span></p>\n<p><b>One thing I&#8217;ve noticed interviewing designers, particularly designers who have worked on the East Coast and in New York city, is the frustration at a lack of philosophy in start­up design. In my experience, I remember at least, when I worked in Tech, how much technical specialization is valued versus philosophy, and I&#8217;m curious to see I you have felt any of that yourself.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. This may be a kind of blasphemy, but I used to be a member of those cults of the old world’s philosophy. I was long a part of the Swiss Typography mafia in Shinjuku. At the time, I loved the perfect movements of type by 0.001 points – where the average human being couldn’t really tell anything had changed. Invisible details, you know? I used to love that. And then I realized it was a cult, and a form of brainwashing. It was a constraining thing. It was a safe place to be, and great to have learned. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So both skills are important – the place of safety that the past provides, and the new things that can be made in the medium of technology. It&#8217;s the people who can go across the two, fluidly, that I think this region needs more of. But if you take a viewpoint of, &#8220;I know philosophy; you don&#8217;t. So you suck.&#8221; Or, “I can code; you don’t. So you suck.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;If there were one thing that ticks me off, it is that certain voices still cannot be heard, and I believe that with the fortune and responsibility in the voice that I have, I want to do everything I can to amplify those voices. But more work has to be done.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>It&#8217;s almost like both sides are the same in that way, which is funny to think about.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s how sides are made. There are those who say, “I know this; you don&#8217;t know that.” Then another person nods in disbelief, “What? You don&#8217;t know that? Really? You didn&#8217;t know that?” Hmm. I&#8217;m so over that kind of thinking. I&#8217;m not into that at all. We can all learn from each other. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are your photographs behind you? What are they?</span></p>\n<p><b>Some are mine, some are from friends. I try not to have my own photos up there, because it feels like I&#8217;m looking at my own iMac screensaver or something.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I understand.</span></p>\n<p><b>Or having like a portrait of yourself in your bedroom.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s a bit awkward, I understand.</span></p>\n<p><b>Okay, where do I want to go now? What are you working on right now, in 2016, either for work or for yourself?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m working on the 2016 #DesignInTech Report ­ ­the second edition. Last year it came out at SXSW. I thought it would get 50,000 views—it had 850,000 views. So, surprise! Sheer luck. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Woah.&#8221; I’m making the new version—that&#8217;s coming out in three weeks, so I&#8217;m sitting in front of Keynote, moving things around, and tossing things out. I hope it&#8217;s able to communicate this relationship between business, design, and tech that I care about.  I want to keep showing how it&#8217;s valuable, and that you can assign dollar signs to it: DESIGN is DE$IGN. Some people consider the dollar signs as being dirty, or just outright wrong. But I consider it work that I get to do right now. So I&#8217;m going to do it.</span></p>\n<p><b>How is life without possessions right now? Do you feel like you&#8217;re going to stick to that for a while?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s been really great. I was observing how younger people live lighter lives, so I&#8217;ve been getting to live that right now. When I was at RISD, I had an 18 room mansion with six bathrooms or whatever, and I didn&#8217;t have that much stuff anyways. Now I just kind of have a suitcase and travel light, and after I broke my right arm over the winter holidays by tripping while on a run, I can&#8217;t carry as much now. So I&#8217;m even lighter now.</span></p>\n<p><b>That’s interesting because I&#8217;ve historically been a person who gets rid of everything she owns every time she moves­­.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interesting.</span></p>\n<p><b>And I&#8217;ve moved a lot. And this is the first time I&#8217;ve ever put things on the wall in my apartment. It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve ever had more than a Craigslist couch or a Craigslist bed. It&#8217;s really new and interesting for me and I think it&#8217;s been good for me in a way because I think I would have moved from San Francisco for reasons that don&#8217;t even make sense, like, &#8220;Things are great. Let me just completely like throw it all at the air and move somewhere else. But this have forced me to be stable for the first time in my life. So I think it might be good for me for now.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s the thing; you live different lives. So this part of your life is this.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in five or ten years?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wow. I hope that I&#8217;m still involved in the start­up world. I hope I&#8217;m making a start­up, or I hope I&#8217;m at a start­up. I&#8217;ve just learned so much from the start­up generation. I figure I have to learn more by being in that world. That&#8217;s what I hope.</span></p>\n<p><b>My last question for you would be, based on the lessons you&#8217;ve learned through your own experience or the experience of those you&#8217;ve taught, what advice would you give to young designers just getting their start in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would strongly suggest that they be curious about business because business is only scary when it&#8217;s not understood. People who are creative especially in the tech world will be looked down upon unless they are curious about business. Everyone&#8217;s got a different language. The more languages you speak, the more positive damage you can do on the world</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> [chuckles]. So that&#8217;s my take.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I would strongly suggest that they be curious about business because business is only scary when it&#8217;s not understood.

Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born in Brooklyn, New York to a pretty warm family. They’re predominately blue collar on both sides. My dad was born in Nigeria and lived in Sweden. My mom was born in Trinidad, an island seven miles north of Venezuela. She moved to the States when she was a teenager to continue her education. After college, she settled in Brooklyn, New York where a lot of her family lived. My father-to-be was still a continent away in Scandinavia.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mom had a good friend who, just like her, loved to travel the world. This friend was doing her master’s in Sweden and invited my mom to visit. On her trip over, she caught a cold but mustered the strength to still go out and do things. Then one day she went to a local church and found herself sneezing a lot. A gentleman sitting behind her kept saying “bless you.” Later that day, the church had choir practice. My mom, an amazing singer, ended up practicing with them. Further into practice, she started singing a song that the “bless you” man started playing the piano along to. She turned around to who would become my dad. Obviously he got her number.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They started dating and, after some time, got married in Sweden. This was 1993. I was born September 14th the following year in Brooklyn, New York. But my dad, in need of a sponsor, wasn’t able to make it to the US in time for my birth. He was distraught. I was cool with it because I was five minutes old. My dad was still finishing up his Master’s/MD program, so the distance from his family definitely affected him. He was finally able to move to the US in 1998. In the four-year period before this, I briefly lived in Trinidad to learn about culture and be near my mother’s family. Then we lived in Sweden to be with my father. “We&#8221; was my mom, myself, and my half-brother. We have the same mother and different fathers, but my father was definitely a father to him too. I’m close to my brother. We’re 12 years apart, so growing up wasn’t your typical sibling-relationship, but it worked and still works for us.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Maybe that’s why computers were so interesting to me. A way to “escape” into a new world, full of possibilities. Where the cure to loneliness was a Cmd+T away.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up in New York, I was surrounded by South Caribbean culture. Most of my father’s family lived in Maryland, so although I knew and occasionally visited them, I didn’t know their culture too much. However, when it was time for my brother to go to college, my father suggested we move to Baltimore, Maryland. We did, and all of a sudden I was surrounded by African culture. Stark difference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baltimore was a major change from Brooklyn. New York is fast-paced. Maryland is not. New York is dense. Maryland isn’t sparse, but it’s not New York level either. And we lived in Baltimore County, not the city. So it was even more laid back than my previous home. People drove more and rode the bus less. The transportation system was complete crap. I got used to all of it though. I also got used to my dad’s family’s culture. My mother has two siblings. My father has six. Four of whom also lived in Baltimore at the time. His family is very close, so I’d see my cousins more than some people saw their siblings. They all felt like brothers and sisters to me, but then I’d have to go home to no kids whereas they had their own siblings. Looking back now, I realize that I often felt alone as a child, yearning for my brother. I’d see him like twice a year when he was doing his Bachelor’s and Master’s, but I got used to it. Maybe that’s why computers were so interesting to me. A way to “escape” into a new world, full of possibilities. Where the cure to loneliness was a Cmd+T away. Still, my family’s culture taught me the value of family. I finished up elementary school in Baltimore, then attended middle and high school. Childhood was fine though. No sleepovers, culture thing. First job was cleaning our church. Oh, and I got a ton of migraines. They’re gone now. Thank God.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I remember in elementary and middle school, I used to talk a lot. I also asked “too many” questions. My parents said it was because I didn’t have a sibling around to play with, so I’d get bored. When I&#8217;d finally see another child, it was like a seeing a new species and I’d feel the sudden urge to tell them all the things. Of course this was much to the dismay of teachers, so I’d often find myself in trouble. However, one of my teachers in elementary school didn’t see my talkative nature as being a “disruptive child.” She saw boredom and sought to challenge me. She put me in a program called GT, or Gifted and Talented. It was a track for students who should probably be a grade or two above, but didn’t skip. One year into it, I was still talkative, but it was much more bearable. I also felt challenged. Looking back, I really appreciate what she did for me. Most of my teachers told my parents that I had a learning disability, or that I exhibited traits that often lead to dysfunctional people in society. This teacher just saw me for who I was. A bored child. Thanks, Ms. Gaston.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was probably the first identification that maybe my skills and interests were not aligned with those of my classmates. I was the “draws all over his homework” kid. Of course, I learned to conform. Just like I had to conform to desks designed for right-handers when I was part of the left-handed club. Then in middle school, my attraction to web went through the roof when I stumbled upon code. I found it so intriguing to be able to do whatever you want and put up whatever you want with no teachers around to strike you seven points. It was ultimate freedom and I wanted it. So I taught myself HTML and CSS, then starting hacking around.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started doing websites for family, then family friends, and finally strangers. I remember setting up a Paypal account to collect payments. I connected it to my checking account that my mom let me sign up for. It was a branch of Wachovia built for children. I remember taking on some projects that required <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash\" target=\"_blank\">Flash</a> or some heavy <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript\" target=\"_blank\">JS</a>. Instead of turning those projects down, I’d say “oh, I can do that!” Then I’ll read up tutorials or would find things around the web I could build off of, like Wix. Ugh, I used to use Wix. I would figure out what the yearly cost was for services like Wix, then would add on a premium to the project total so that I’d collect a profit at the end. It was cool getting those monthly or yearly charges from services I would use for the projects. Sometimes I’d mis-plan and go in the negative, but I was learning. Design and business. After two years of this grind, I was able to save up for my first Macbook. Third-hand off eBay.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daytime, I was in school. I started identifying the classes that interested me the most. Math, psychology, and English. Math had systems and frameworks. Psychology broke down the way people think. English, had creative writing – freedom of expression. I found it very interesting because it was the one type of assignment where your teacher could only grade you on grammar and spelling. There was no such thing as a bad idea. These things stuck with me, and ultimately influenced my design career.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">English class ended up leading to another passion – blogging. I started my first blog over a school summer. It was called mediainfive.com. The goal was to capture the top news of the day and synthesize them into a five minute digest. The site probably got 100 views per month. I’m pretty sure they were my mom and her friends showing me support. I ended up pausing the blog when I returned to school. My second blog was called trendingweb.com. It consisted of interviews I’d conduct with entrepreneurs from around the web who were building cool stuff. Their products often had little-to-no users at the time. Some of these companies turned out to be Zerply and 6Wunderkinder, makers of the todo list app, <a href=\"https://www.wunderlist.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wunderlist</a>. These blogs also led to writing opportunities at bigger sites. I did an internship at <a href=\"http://appadvice.com/appnn\" target=\"_blank\">AppAdvice</a>, a blog that focused on Apple’s iOS store. At the time, it averaged a million views per month, so that was a big change for me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Writing 5–8 articles a day for them taught me discipline and polish. A lot of the practices I learned there would stick with me down-the-line. Afterwards, I wrote for a blog called <a href=\"http://www.macgasm.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Macgasm</a>, also focused on Apple. This site was incredible. It was the first time I “hit” <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hacker News</a>, <a href=\"https://news.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Google News</a>, and broke a site from web traffic. It also led to me visiting San Jose to attend a tech conference, where I got to meet really inspiring people who would become friends in the future. Chris Anderson, the founder of <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TED</a>, and Mark Johnson, then CEO of <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2015/11/19/flipboard-to-shutter-zite-on-127-asks-users-to-migrate-data-before-then/\" target=\"_blank\">Zite</a>, were a couple of them. On my way back from that trip, I remember reaching out to Mark for an interview. I wanted to play around with a new format of recording an interview, transcribing it, then summarizing it into a sort of story with pull-quotes. If you saw my recording setup, you’d laugh. But it was different, and he was down for it. It spawned a series of interviews of a similar fashion that I did for Macgasm, and led to me getting my own column. I met other friends through this column like the Sparrow, Flud, and Instacast founders. Looking back, it was an evolution of TrendingWeb. I’m grateful for having had that experience. And I’m grateful to my parents for letting me pretend to be sick, so I could skip school for a few days for the San Jose trip.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By now I was in high school. I attended Overlea High. It was a big change from my middle school. Parkville Middle was in the top 10 in Maryland. Overlea High was in the bottom 10. Why did I go there? In our school system, each student had zone schools, or schools they’d attend by default based off location. Golden Ring Middle and Overlea High were my zone schools. After elementary school, I applied to Parkville for their magnet program. In it, I got to take interesting courses like Mass Communication, Visual Arts, Environmental Sciences, and Applied Engineering. When high school time came around, I applied and didn’t get into my school of choice, Eastern Technical High. The number one in the state and top 5% in the country. In the future, I learned that some parts of my application were mixed up with another student, costing my acceptance. No one thought to correct it and I ended up at Overlea. Most of my friends went to Eastern, so day one of Overlea was definitely an adjustment. It was pretty bad. First day, there were at least five fights and three suspensions. We even had metal detectors at the school’s front entrance.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I remember students joking during my first few months that I probably got into numerous fights, or that I was a thug, etc. The theme was that I was lucky for even getting into Eastern, and that I wasn’t going to succeed at the school. I mean, during week one people would literally move out of my way in the hallways.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I found the good. Our school had a program called <a href=\"http://www.deca.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DECA</a> – Distributive Education Clubs of America. It’s very similar to FBLA – <a href=\"http://www.fbla-pbl.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Future Business Leaders of America</a>. It was a business club for high school students that had competitions at the county, state, national, and international level. My club-mates and I competed our way to internationals which took place in California. We traveled for the contest, and although we didn’t place at that level, it was an amazing experience. It was a big deal for our school. It was also my first dose of California weather. I knew I’d be back one day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Halfway through my first year of high school, Eastern Tech announced that they would do something they had never done before – allow students to apply to enroll in 10th grade. My parents were all over this. I applied and got accepted. I later learned that only two students were accepted state-wide. My mom was excited, but I didn’t care anymore. I had gotten used to Overlea, built some friendships, was top of my class, and didn’t mind the fights anymore. My mom wasn’t having it and, come the following August, I was an Eastern Tech student.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tenth grade. I remember showing up to school on day one. People looked at my funny. Was it because I came from Overlea? Was it because I didn’t look like anyone there? Maybe both. I was coming from a school that had a very negative stereotype. I was entering a school that was probably 75% Caucasian and 2% African-American. I remember students joking during my first few months that I probably got into numerous fights, or that I was a thug, etc. The theme was that I was lucky for even getting into Eastern, and that I wasn’t going to succeed at the school. I mean, during week one people would literally move out of my way in the hallways. Like, did they think I’d shove them or something?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It took about half a year for me to settle in and for the negative sentiment to “settle down.” Like Parkville, Eastern provided magnet courses that students could major in. The options were Health, Automotive Technology, Business Management and Finance, Interactive Media Production, Construction, Culinary, Engineering, IT, Law, and Teaching. I chose IT, the closest I could find to my evening passion of coding. I later learned there was little overlap, but I still learned a lot. By graduation, I was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCNA\" target=\"_blank\">CCNA</a>-certified and could work entry-level for Cisco or the NSA. I didn’t do anything with that certification, but the knowledge was valuable. I remember learning how to make ethernet cables from scratch, and at least retained the knowledge for fixing my wifi when it acts up. However, I realized in 11th grade that although it was interesting, IT was too technical for me. I didn’t want to fix the Internet, I wanted to build awesome things on it.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>“Online, I experienced more ageism than racism, primarily because I hid my face for a long time.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This realization led to me noticing that my true passion lied with websites. How they looked and how they worked. Up until then, I had messed around in Photoshop and tried to design, but I didn’t consider it a skill. So I decided to change that. I started reading blogs like <a href=\"http://alistapart.com/\" target=\"_blank\">A List Apart</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/say-hello-to-treehouse-the-new-name-for-think-vitamin-membership\" target=\"_blank\">Think Vitamin</a>. Then I’d find designs from around the web that I liked and would try to reverse engineer them in Photoshop. I did 2–3 a night. It didn’t take long for the practices to commit to memory. However, I couldn’t find much content on what it meant to a designer. Or a content that covered the developments of the design industry. Like, what tools were people using nowadays? Or what we could learn from the most recent hot app? I don’t know why I felt like I was the one to do it, but I told myself I’d create a blog for this. I met my blog co-founder, <a href=\"http://drewwilson.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Drew Wilson</a>, on Twitter. A couple months later we started <i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/industry\">The Industry</a>.</i></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was November 2011. Our tagline was “covering design-focused startups and people.” In our first month, we had a couple thousand visits. 6 months in, we were averaging one hundred thousand. Drew handled the design, development, and promotion. I handled editorial, and sponsorships. We ended up building an editorial team of 12 people. Our first, and most loyal sponsor, was Squarespace. We started a podcast with <a href=\"http://adamstacoviak.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Stacoviak</a>, and within months, it had surpassed the blog in popularity. It also represented a majority of our revenue, which I used to pay our editorial team. The team was distributed. None of us met in person until years later, but it was a true passion project. I remember writing, editing, and coordinating with the team in the evenings and weekends, then reviewing articles to publish at school during lunch time. The team is all in great places now. One’s a designer at Microsoft by way of <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sunrise-calendar-outlook-app/id599114150?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">Sunrise</a>, another is just crushing it in New York, another is a writer at <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Invision</a>, one’s VP of Design at <a href=\"https://www.acorns.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Acorns</a>, etc.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I didn’t know it at the time, but the podcast which we called The Industry Radio Show, would play a huge role for me. Each week, we’d have guests on to chat about design. I’d notice patterns in their background stories, what they did day-to-day, and what they were most passionate about. They were describing my job description. A lightbulb went off in my head. I told myself, “okay, this is the kind of work I want to do. The best of all worlds. Write, design, code.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>“My dad’s an optimist, but it hit him in that moment. Because he knew that something as small as someone just slightly discriminating against you could destroy your life. For him, it was something that could have kept him from his family indefinitely. For me, it was something that could have ended my chance of going to college and put in jail.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High school was wrapping up soon. I applied to one university in Maryland, and two in Pennsylvania. UMBC, Drexel, and UPenn. I got into them and was now faced with a decision, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I didn’t need any of them to pursue my newfound job description. I had become jaded to the whole college thing, but didn’t throw it out altogether. I knew it was important to my family, and that I would be judged by my peers if I didn’t go. After all, there was a stereotype. I opted for Drexel with a major in something design-y, and a minor in psychology.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was the plan. Graduation came. I remember sitting down with my class and facing all the parents, thinking to myself “I wonder how many of them are doing what they love as a career?” Then I looked around to members of my class. Some had huge smiles on their faces, knowing that they got into the school of their choice, their boyfriend was coming with them, and that “everything was going to be awesome.” Some had partial smiles on their face, knowing that they were going to get the education they wanted, but at the cost of their parents savings or theirs. Some, like me, were expressionless. Were we all thinking the same thing? Were we all thinking “is the future really as simple as getting a degree and getting a job? Or must we find our own path?” I don’t know, but I know that’s what I was thinking. In that moment, while our valedictorian spoke, I decided to choose my own path. Step one was finding an alternative to college.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started thinking about the guests from the podcast again. How did they find their path? I also started weighing the education system against this “choose your own path” model. It leaned heavily to “choose path.” I recalled the feels I’d get when I’d ship a website for someone, or publish an article on the blog. Or the fact that Drew, although years older than me, didn’t care about my age or race. He just appreciated my work. I then thought about school, and some of my teachers dating back to elementary school. My quarrels with how tests were set up for memorization and not comprehension. The racism and stereotype I felt coming from Overlea. And finally, how I nearly lost it all by an ungrounded accusation.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I know that’s what I was thinking. In that moment, while our valedictorian spoke, I decided to choose my own path. Step one was finding an alternative to college.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About that accusation. About 1–2 months before graduation, I woke up late for school. The night before was a long one for <i>The Industry</i>. My dad drove me to school. I exited the car, walked into the front office, signed the late slip, then proceeded to my homeroom. In my second class of the day, the assistant principal and another faculty member came into my class and stopped it. They asked me to come to the front office with them. The tone was anger. I was completely puzzled and remember hearing mumbles from students that I was probably in big trouble. But for what? We finally got to the assistant principal’s office and the other faculty member said in a demoralizing and assertive voice, “We were informed this morning that you have been dealing marijuana around school and that you came in this morning smelling like it.” I was shocked. I asked where they got that information from and they said they couldn’t reveal that information. I then told them to check their cameras outside and at the front-desk. “My dad drove me to school. You have a camera outside looking at everyone who walks in. If you check that camera and check the timestamp, you’ll realize that 15 seconds later I was in the front office, which also has a camera. You’ll see that I signed in and left for my homeroom. You can then talk to my substitute homeroom teacher and ask when I got in. And then you’ll know that there was no way I could possibly have done anything in between that time.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I was saying this, it hit me who made the accusation. My substitute homeroom teacher. When you get to school late, they’re the first person you go to before heading to your class. That day, I went from my homeroom teacher to the class I was pulled out from. It had to be her, so I asked. They froze. Without speaking, they had answered. At this point I was just trying to keep my cool. I started smelling myself out of curiosity. I wasn’t sweating or anything, and I showered that morning. I smelled normal. So I asked them to smell me. One of them asked, “what?” “Well you said that a teacher said I smelled like weed. You just pulled me out of a class. I’ve only been in school for 30 minutes. I haven’t changed my clothes. Smell me and tell me if I smell like weed.” The assistant principal did. So they leaned in and said, “Yeah, I don’t smell anything.” By this point, logic had won. I had also proven a point. Before doing the simple act of following up with the teacher, or checking the cameras, they were convinced. That was wrong. Not to mention, they threatened that I could lose my college acceptances, scholarships, and that I could be arrested right then and there by the police officer standing outside.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though logic had won, there was something painful in the back of my mind that I learned growing up. By being black, I was at a disadvantage by default. So when faced with such situations, I had to keep my composure and let nothing else show but my logic and reasoning. Somehow it worked. The faculty guy said I could go back to class and that they’ll talk to whomever to get to the bottom of the situation. I nodded, but before getting up I noticed something outside the front office. It was a wall of the names of students who got higher than a 2,000 on the SAT. For the mic drop, I turned and said “by the way, I notice that my name is missing from that wall. So after you get to the bottom of this, do you think I can be added?” Then left. The rest of that day was draining. I couldn’t think, eat, or talk. I went home looking like a zombie. It didn’t really hit me until I got home. I started breaking down. Why the hell was this happening to me? And so close to graduation? Could I really have lost everything in that moment? What would have happened it I didn’t react the way I did? I was afraid to tell my parents, but finally mustered it right before going to bed. They were in pain after hearing it. It reminded my parents of something that happened to my dad in Sweden that nearly put him away for a long time. Something he didn’t do, but was accused of doing because he “looked like someone who would do it.” Sad part? The thing he was accused never even occurred. By anyone. Now his son was experiencing something similar.</span></p>\n<p><b>Holy shit.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My dad’s an optimist, but it hit him in that moment. Because he knew that something as small as someone just discriminating against you could destroy your life. For him, it was something that could have kept him from his family indefinitely. For me, it was something that could have ended my chance of going to college and put in jail.</span></p>\n<p><b>Wow.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Needless to say, that dampened things for me. After he was told, my brother took a train from DC to Baltimore with the intention of going into my school. I wasn’t looking forward to it. I didn’t want to be “that kid.” The one who doesn’t let things die, but drags them out after a resolution had been reached. But my brother made a valid point. “It’s not a matter of settling things. They need to understand; one, what they did; two, why it’s wrong; and three, to never do it again to any student, right.” I felt confident that he’d handle the situation well. If you think I’m articulate, just meet my brother. He doesn’t lose. He didn’t. I don’t know what he said to them, but the same teachers who pulled me out of class showed up to every one of my classes that day to deliver the same message. As if from a script, “Hi. We just want to come by and let all of you know that yesterday we pulled Jared out of the classroom because he was suspected of an act. We know some rumors have spread around the class. Rumors are detrimental to students. They can hurt your reputation. We want to clarify that Jared did not do anything. He’s fine. He has not done anything wrong. We will not tolerate rumor and gossip.” I felt so warm inside. My family had my back. My brother had my front. Being his younger sibling, he felt the need to protect me at all costs. Especially from something he knew was real and out there. Obviously, students still gossiped, and to some I remained “guilty” through to graduation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So that evening, the evening after graduation, I pondered on the podcast. I knew what I wanted. I remembered an episode with a designer who was also an advisor to a company called <a href=\"https://teamtreehouse.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Treehouse</a>. I loved Treehouse. I remembered <a href=\"http://www.carsonified.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Carsonified</a>, the company it came out from. I use to read a blog they published called Think Vitamin. I was intrigued by Treehouse’s mission, so I reached out to its founder, Ryan Carson. I told him what got me excited every morning, what got me excited about Treehouse, and how I felt I could contribute. After a series of interviews, I got the job! I came on as editor of Treehouse Blog, a spinoff of Think Vitamin. It was a dream come true. To help shape the presence of a blog that came from something that inspired me just a couple years prior. Of course I still did <i>The Industry</i> nights and weekends, but we discussed and agreed on a way that the sites would not compete with each other. Our tone, content, and audiences were different.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My job involved helping on building an architecture for what would become their blog, newsletter, and marketing. It was my first time working with product designers. They were my favorite. A month or so into the job, the remote Treehouse employees were flown into Orlando for our team get-together. It was an amazing feeling seeing other people who were all part of the team, building towards the same vision. However, by the end of it reality started settling in that maybe I might still have to go to college. Although I wasn’t the most passionate about it, my parents still expected it. I remember having a conversation with Ryan telling him the possibility. At first, he was caught of guard. And of course he was. After all, part of the mission of Treehouse was to provide the education I was passionate about, so that people of all ages didn’t have to spend tens of thousands acquiring the skills. Especially if the curriculums had a high chance of being out of date. But he understood where I was coming from. Ultimately I left Treehouse after about four months, but it was an incredible summer full of lessons and confidence boosters that I wouldn’t be aware of until months later.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I met up with two guys on the Internet. Both were from Kansas, but none of us had ever met in person. We all shared a passion for emails. I became fascinated by it when I interviewed the Sparrow founders a year earlier for the Macgasm column. We also shared a passion for the potential use of iPads in the workplace. We were like, “let’s start a company.” We called it <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/evomail\" target=\"_blank\">Evomail</a>. Evolved email. In hindsight, bad name. Sounds like evil mail. We really had to enunciate the “vo” or people would look at us awkwardly. I’d like to say that we were on to something. Some of the things we built are now in products like Inbox, Outlook, and other apps. Didn’t come directly from us, but patterns make their way around eventually. Some of the things I’ve yet to see in a product. One of the things we wanted to do, was to recognize if an email came from a person, or a service. If it came from a service, was it informative or a subscription? If it was informative, could we treat it like a notification? Imagine if you got an email from UPS, that should not take up the same cognitive space as an email from a close friend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evomail was going well. We knew what we wanted to build and we were building it. It was an amazing experience cutting new builds everyday, and putting them in my parents hands. Although they didn’t exactly know what was going on, the builds were enough to show them that I had found my passion. Communication. Communication by words, process, and pixels. It also bought me some time off of college. I negotiated my parents into letting me take my first year off of college to work on Evomail and <i>The Industry</i>. On my 18th birthday, I decided to write a blog post on the blog. The target was other creatives in my age group. Those who had a burning flame of passion inside them that they were constantly afraid would be blown out. Blown out for age, race, gender, and what have you. I wanted to address the age piece, so I spent my entire birthday drafting a 6,000 word biography of my journey to finding my passion. With an undertone of “keep at it, friend.” Somehow it blew up! I woke up to it being #2 on Hacker News and the most read article on our blog! I started getting comments from others saying “I’m 17 and I love blank!” “I’m 19 and I do blank!” It was an age-coming out party, and everyone was loving it, or so I thought.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although he never said it directly, I sensed a perspective change from one of my co-founders. It’s as if I went from being an equal to being an intern. It was ironic. I “revealed” my age for the first time because I was finally confident. And apparently lots of people were hiding it for the same reason. But who knew that my decision would hurt me in my own company?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following January, <a href=\"https://www.mailboxapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mailbox</a> announced their app with an awesome product video. In one of their initial press articles, a reviewer mentioned that a big problem for the app might be their lack of labels. I felt otherwise. So I wrote an article on my blog expressing that although they were competition, I felt that they were approaching the inbox from an interesting perspective. And that I looked forward to the hustle. Without intention, the article made its way around and ended up as something Mailbox would reference on Twitter when asked by people why they didn’t support typical labels. Felt like good karma. The CEO then reached out a few weeks or so later. He mentioned the article and Evomail, having seen some of the design on Dribbble. Although nothing was said directly, he seemed interested in what we were building. Especially why we started with the iPad. I remember telling my co-founders this–expecting a positive response. Instead, the CEO reacted a bit displeased. As if I had done something wrong by it being me who interacted with Mailbox and not him. A month or so later, Mailbox was acquired by Dropbox.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Although he never said it directly, I sensed a perspective change from one of my co-founders.

It was a 3-month program targeted at Product Designers who wanted a dose of Silicon Valley. I was intrigued. After weeks of negotiation, I convinced my parents. The deal was “3 months in California, then you come back to start college.” Come April 2013, I moved out to San Francisco. By this point, the collaboration at Evomail had significantly broken down. We were all working hard, but not as a team. I still felt the same vibes from the “birthday article,” and other events occurred that just amplified the feels. Around three weeks into San Francisco, I got a phone call. It was my co-founder. We talked about ways for me to push the Evomail brand now that I was in San Francisco, but then the conversation started to changing to “so what if you move into more of an ambassador role?” Of course this seemed completely weird to me. Every founder is an ambassador of his or her product. We agreed that there was no need for a “role change.” A month later, I got another call. I was getting kicked out of my own company. My stake was depleted, and I was left with nothing. The product launched a few weeks later with mixed-to-positive tech press. I received no credit for my work, but I didn’t care. What pained me the most was that the product I had invested the last 10 months of my life into, deferred college for, didn’t take a paying job for, was gone. Just like that. I felt like I had lost a child. I felt so sick for the next three months. I won’t go into details, but trust me. It was not fair, it was cold, and it came back to bite the company. I learned so much from Evomail. It was the first digital product I designed from scratch. It was my first startup. It was my first termination. It was my first sense of purpose. It was my biggest sense of defeat. God, it hurt, but looking back I loved that I went through all of that. Of course, that’s how I felt in the moment. It made me feel my age and race again. How many other people would do this to me in the future? I started dressing older, forcing myself to talk deeper, and prioritizing phone calls over in-person meets.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few weeks later, I got a call from a big tech company, public, voicing interest in Evomail. This company would have made me a millionaire… before taxes [laughs]. Although I told them that I was no longer financially invested in the company, they pushed for a conversation. They were kind of like, we still actually want this thing, so we can either hire you for our mail team, or you can reach out to your ex-founders and push for a deal… getting your stock back in the deal. I remember having to deal with that. I sought advice from close friends and my parents. The feedback I heard was either, “I don’t know what to do. It sucks to be in that position.” Or, “don’t take it.” I didn’t take it. I told the person I was in contact with that I would be passing altogether. And that if they still wanted the product, to reach out to the remaining team. I didn’t tell the team because communication had ended between us. However, I did end up making peace with the other founder, not the CEO, a year later when he visited San Francisco. I never really had issues with him. He was just too on the fence. There are certain things you’re just not on the fence about. I feel like he – and he kind of admitted this a little – just didn’t speak up. Apparently, after I was kicked out, a few months later, the CEO tried to remove him too.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I started dressing older, forcing myself to talk deeper, and prioritizing phone calls over in-person meets.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the “fear your age and race” thing started to creep back up again. Was this graduation all over again? Thankfully, I didn’t experience it much at my first job in the city, <a href=\"https://omadahealth.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Omada Health</a>. I was hired as their first full-time product designer. I remember having a good experience there, but I did feel treated like a child at times. Especially by co-workers who had children. Some with children around my age. To some of them, I could be their child, which is true. But, I’m not. I’m your co-worker at a company that we both work for. Don’t treat me like I’m your child. People asked why I left after six months. Part of it was that I worked on an interesting project, finished it, and felt good about it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was only really supposed to be there for three months anyway. My parents wanted me back for college. I stayed on longer because the project was fascinating. Building a product that allowed pre-Type II Diabetic people take back control of their health. My project was over, and I felt like I had gotten a good dose of the medical field. Most of my father’s family is in it, so my tolerance was only so high [laughter]. But part of it was that I didn’t like feeling like a child amongst adults. It wasn’t that I wanted to be treated like a boss. I just wanted to do good work and be respected by my peers. I felt like I was doing one, but only getting half of the other. I still appreciated my time there and the people I had an opportunity of working with. They gave me a beautiful send off. I left the day before my 19th birthday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My plan was to take a break, but that lasted all of one week. I joined <a href=\"https://obvious.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Obvious Corp</a>, the organization behind Branch, Medium, and Lift. Lift, the habit tracking app. I worked on that. It was great. I worked on the 2.0. I was only there for less than a year though. My parents, coming from a different generation, felt that four jobs in two years seemed weird. They wanted to know if I had a plan, or if I should just move back east and go to school. “I promise you. I’m not fickle. I have a vision, and I’m making mistakes along the way. But these mistakes are lessons and I’ll figure it out in the end. I learned, four times.” I told them that my plan was to contract, build work and social credibility, and when I’m ready, to find a role where I will be respected and do good work. They agreed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did some contracts. One was <a href=\"http://nuzzel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nuzzel</a>, a news app. Another was <a href=\"https://www.bloomthat.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomthat</a>, an on-demand flowers product. I did some other niche products too. It was really fun! I got to work on <a href=\"http://bulanproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bulan Project</a>, something by my friend Elle Luna, with other friends of mine. Those were creatively liberating and fun. Then a really close friend of mine reached out and was like, “Hey man, if I told you there was a company that I would join, would you join?” And I’m like, “Yeah, if such a company existed.” Background on this dude. He does not full time. Period. So I asked him why he wasn’t there already. “Well, I just finished YC, I have a company, I’m about to have a child, and we’re thinking of moving to Hawaii.” Fair. So I said intro away. He introduced me to a company called <a href=\"https://teespring.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Teespring</a>. I met their co-founder, Walker. Within minutes of talking to him, I knew he hired talent and only talent. He didn’t care who you were, what your background was, your race, age, or gender. He just cared if you could do good, passionate work. I never left a meeting so passionate about a company or so trusting of its leadership. I joined a month later as Creative Director. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first thing I did was redesign the logo. Second was build the team to five product designers and one brand designer. By the end of 2014, I was designing and managing a team at the same time. I had to learn fast. With time I found myself less and less in Photoshop or Sketch, but in meetings working to figure out the direction of a business that, between joining and leaving, had 20x. The growth was fun to watch. We went from 30 people to 300+. But with the growth of the team and product, I had to juggle managing a team and still designing. It wasn’t easy, but I developed invaluable muscles from the grind. The lessons were numerous. From what it means to grow a team, to growing yourself, which is just as important. If not more. My time at Teespring was similar to Omada Health. Great product, culture, and growth. But people are people, and everywhere you go, you’ll meet some who are partially blinded by attributes that don’t pertain to your output. After a year and a half, I left to take a break and detox from the grind. I intentionally didn’t have a plan.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;But people are people, and everywhere you go, you’ll meet some who are partially blinded by attributes that don’t pertain to your output.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I took about two weeks to do nothing. I read, called my parents more, caught up on some shows, and took more walks. <a href=\"http://www.greylock.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Greylock</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fuelcapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fuel Capital</a> became my home. I started working out of one, and contracting for the other’s portfolio companies. It was fun getting to work with founders again on very early product. I took up one more advisory position. One of my contracts, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/withcopper\" target=\"_blank\">Copper</a>, really intrigued me. I was introduced to its founder, Doug, by Fuel Capital months before. He was on an ambitious agenda to “kill passwords for people.” We built a close working relationship over the next few months, and he finally asked me to come on board full-time. I pondered over it for a while. I wasn’t planning to go all in that soon. I sought advice from some mentors of mine. I was torn between ramping up my contracting and possibly starting an agency, going in-house at a VC firm, or going all in with Copper. A friend of mine, Daniel Burka, made it all so clear. He asked me what I longed for the most. I said I wanted to make real impact again. I wanted to ship an idea to the world. I wanted to take a huge bet on something so ambitious, it was “destined” to fail. I realized I was describing Copper. Agency and VC life could wait a few years. So I joined. Now it’s three of us. We are trying to replace passwords. I think we have a fair shot. Keep an eye out in the coming months.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that’s 1994 to 2016. Online I experienced more ageism than racism, primarily because I hid my face for a long time. On Twitter, my last name is Nigerian, but you can’t tell. And when I say, “hid my face,” I mean it. My avatar has evolved over the years. It stared as a silhouette, then evolved to a half-shot of the side of my face, to the entire side of my face, to my face. I’d like to think that it mirrored my evolution of my self-identity. I’ve always been self-aware, but now I know myself too. I know my strengths, my weaknesses, and my faults. I know where I’ve come from, and I have a plan for where I’m going. I’ll be dammed if I let people kill my vibe because I look a little different to them. I could care less.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p>&#8220;Online I experienced more ageism than racism, primarily because I hid my face for a long time.

Walking down a street, it’s not uncommon to see a woman pull her purse a little closer in, or cross the street before we cross paths. It’s not strange to notice an Uber driver eyeing me through the rear-view mirror. On buses, it’s not weird to see someone stand instead of sitting in the only empty seat that’s next to me. I’ve sadly desensitized myself to these micro-interactions over the years. So that’s why when people ask if I experience racism, I don’t immediately recall these interactions to memory. For me, racism and ageism had to smack me in my face to get a reaction, and everything else was just “how life is.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I don’t want the people I work with to ever feel this way. Copper understands this. Yes, it’s only three of us right now, but it’s already part of our identity. We want diversity of people, backgrounds, and thinking. Not to meet quotas, or to look good in Medium articles, but because it’s critical to a company. And because we care. Why would you only want one point of view?</span></p>\n<p><b>All right. Okay, four main questions I want to dig into. You’ve touched on this, but what do you look for in a job now? What is important to you in your job now vs in the beginning?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One – companies that understand the roles they’re hiring for and how those roles may bleed into others. When you start a company, especially in Silicon Valley, there are things you just do—like setup Heroku, use Stripe for payments, and AWS for file storage. Then when it gets to people, you’re like, “Okay. I need a technical co-founder. I need two engineers. I’m going to contract some designer. At some point, I’m gonna need someone in customer service.” Instead of asking yourself, “What in particular, do I need for my business?” It may not be the same as the company across the street from you. Maybe your co-founder should have a background in customer experience because of the type of product you’re building. Such people don’t hire because a blog told them to. I think there’s a strong correlation between people who hire without understanding the roles they’re filling, and the people they hired leaving. If you don’t know, find out. Your hire will appreciate it. It sets up accurate and attainable exceptions. Alignment is good.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two – empathy. People who understand that people are people. When you hire someone, you are entering a relationship. There’s this understanding when it comes to co-founders that you’re finding your partner. You’re marrying this person for the next 5+ years. I think the same applies to employees. They’re not just headcount, they’re people, family. The marriage and family correlation is interesting because it also implies that you’re no longer just thinking about yourself. You think about them and their needs. You try to uncover their problems, blockers, and fears. Then you try, to the best of your ability, to mitigate them. This is empathy. Companies that understand this are in a much better position than those that don’t. Their employees feel valued and empowered to do good and to do more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three – a plan, or at least a shadow of one. Yes, the future is the future, but if you’re just shooting in the dark believing you’ll eventually hit something, I’ll pass. I’m also curious to see how much of a plan a company is willing to reveal to me. Little reveal is a red flag. This also includes mission. I’ve got to be excited about what we’re working towards, or else what’s the point?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Four – the people. Are we compatible? Sometimes we’re not, and that’s okay. Just so the non-compatibility isn’t a result of you being assholes. That’s not okay.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you feel like your background: where you’re from, the places that you’ve lived, your family, the culmination of that and your life experiences, how do you think that that has made you a better designer and even manager?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My dad’s culture is proud, but they are very hard-working people. Recently, a colleague of mine traveled to Nigeria for a project. She came back enlightened. Going, she knew about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam\" target=\"_blank\">419</a>, something that’s synonymous with Nigerians. But she was surprised to learn that 419 represented probably half a percent of the Nigerian population. Yet somehow, it’s something the entire nation is stigmatized for. Being half Nigerian and working in tech, I remember sometimes being wary about revealing that detail. It was the fear of “he got in?” Or “you’re contracting him? He’s 419, man! You can’t trust those people!” Interesting, that never even crossed my mind, until this moment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are so proud and so hard-working because they have to fight that stigma every day. That they’re not corrupt people, but that they are people just like anyone else. But also people who have to work a lot harder than their peer to fight a stigma that pertains to such a small percentage of their people. This impacted me in two ways. It taught me to work hard and be proud of my work. Looking at my family, it always impresses me how much harder they had to fight to get to where they were. And as for pride, it was less ego and more knowing when you did good work, then defending it. I’m not the person to defend disproved work, but I am the person to defend good work. My work, my team’s work, etc. Especially when “good” could be backed up with data. Quantitative or qualitative. I’m the person who says “I will go to war with you. It’s not that I’m right, but that this is right. So if you want to fight me, that’s completely fine. But don’t fight something that is actually going to benefit the company or product.” That’s my family’s type of “proud.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Being half Nigerian and working in tech, I remember sometimes being wary about revealing that detail. It was the fear of he got in?&#8217; Or &#8216;you’re contracting him He’s 419, man! You can’t trust those people!&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On my mother’s side, I learned empathy and the power of giving. If you needed $700 and my mom had $699, she would transfer a dollar from her savings and wire you the $700. I’ve done that before. I remember in my first months in San Francisco, a friend was in need of $500 and I had $510. I just sent it. I stretched that $10 a week until payday that Friday. To stretch $10 for a week in San Francisco is hard [chuckles]. Not easy, we’re talking buying a pack of Top Ramen, and breaking the squares into halves to double it. Then trying to get the water to ramen ration just right so it doesn’t taste like flavored hot water, but “soup.” Nowadays I mentor when I can. Andreessen Horowitz does this program where they pair professionals with college students interested in the same line of work. Its a great way to give back. To impart some of the things I’ve learned over the years, in hopes of having that student replicate my successes and avoid my failures. I try to respond to every email I get. If that person took the time to message me directly, it’s only fair I take the time to respond. We’ll see how far that scales though [chuckles]. Inboxes are dangerous. And I still relearn these traits, empathy and giving, everyday from my girlfriend. She’s the most caring person I know outside of my parents. I love her for this. It’s funny, she’s probably the true designer in our relationship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Empathy is the number one thing for a designer. By definition our job is to remove friction for our customers so the best way to do that is to, in a sense, become the customer and go through your own product. I remember when there was this big renaissance of design thinking a some years back where everyone started saying, “designers, talk to customers!” It’s funny to me, because that sort of thinking should have never been forgotten. If you’re not talking to your customers, what kind of empathy are you employing?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being exposed to different cultures at a young age also impacted me. Seeing different cultures quickly taught me the power of diversity. The thing about being a minority is, if you grow up in an area where you are the majority, your tendency is to stay there because it’s the one place you feel at home. If you look at areas in the US where African-Americans are dominant, you’ll notice that most don’t leave. And why would they? Most of them are taught from young that the world sees them as second-class citizens. That they are at a disadvantage by default. So that it would in their best interest to “settle in and call this home.” The Brooklyn neighborhood I was born in was such a neighborhood. My neighbors are all still there. Same street, same home, same floor. But I was forced out of that reality from a young age. Now, as a designer, I seek diversity to supercharge my solutions.</span></p>\n<p><b>Okay, macro now. How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016, like what excites you, what frustrates you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m excited about the evolution of interfaces. Messaging is becoming a new interface, but I doubt it’s going to be the only one. And it’s not going to be that simple. That tends to be the case in tech anyway. We jump into new territory, explore, identify the patterns that emerge, and then turn them into new platforms. For example, I don’t think Slack is the future; I think the essence of Slack is part of the future. I’m excited for these new platforms. They reduce the cost to start something new, and they expand your reach.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Copper, I hope, will one day be such a platform. Every company is trying to build their identification layer. It’s time consuming. We want to eliminate that overhead for them. Then you have companies like Uber and Airbnb where there’s so much contingent upon you knowing that the people on your services are real and trustworthy that they have to invest millions into their systems. Why couldn’t we solve that for them and their customers? Imagine if you just walk up to any service or any door; there’s one simple protocol by which to identify yourself and it’s free to you, convenient, and secure. More businesses are coming up like that. We’re doing it for passwords and identification but there are people doing it for all sorts of stuff. I’m really excited about that.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’d like to believe that the companies that rise up from this correction will be stronger in the longterm because they had to work a little harder to raise, make a profit, make an impact, and make a return. It kind of parallels my life.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m also excited for the correction that’s going on in the tech sector right now. People are calling it a bubble; I don’t think it’s a bubble. Let’s use balloon as a metaphor. What happened in the Dot Com era was like someone who blew a balloon too big and it just popped. Then a few years ago when we had another correction, that was like someone who blew a balloon kinda big and someone else poked it with a needle before it popped on its own. I think what’s going on now is like someone blowing a balloon and someone else saying, “ah, I’ve seen this shit before,” then just squeezing the air right out of it; so there’s no pop. Just deflation. That’s our current correction. I’d like to believe that the companies that rise up from this correction will be stronger in the longterm because they had to work a little harder to raise, make a profit, make an impact, and make a return. It kind of parallels my life.</span></p>\n<p><b>True.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing I’d like to see change is our transparency as an industry. When I started out, we were very open with each other. Especially the design community. I attribute that openness to us being able to “level up” in the eyes of businesses so quickly. Or what others call our “seat at the table.” However, in the past year or two, we’ve become more secretive. We’ve switched out that open collaborative-ness for bickering and petty bantering. We talk just as much, if not more via mediums like Medium. But I fear we’re moving forward, slower. Nowadays, the people who are the most transparent with me are my closest friends, and even with them there’s still a filter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I understand confidentiality and competitiveness, but the opaqueness leads to slower progression as a community due to a lack of knowledge sharing. We’re more on the sharing of Sketch tips than topics we’re all thinking about, but avoiding. Things like diversity at work, women in tech, and processes to advance the sector as a whole, not just our immediate companies. I don’t know how we get back to the good ol&#8217; days. I don’t know, maybe it’s just nostalgia. Maybe it’s just me. But we’ve been thinking about this a lot at <i>The Industry</i>. We’re building a resource for the design community to help. It’s called Playbook and I hope to put it live in the next few months.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest things that hurts a business or people is miscommunication. What causes miscommunication is people not being transparent or clear. And I think that good communication unearths topics that need to be discussed. I’m rooting for Techies Project, Helena.</span></p>\n<p><b>My last question would be, based on the lessons that you’ve learned over time, what advice would you have for other young designers who are hoping to get in tech or are in tech, and are feeling some of the same challenges that you faced?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let me break the fourth wall here. If you have <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">impostor syndrome</a>, don’t feel like you’re all alone. Everyone has imposter syndrome about something. Anyone who says otherwise is either a narcissist or just lying. Impostor syndrome is different for everyone. For some, it’s weight. For some, it’s height. For some, it’s accent. For some, it’s hairiness. For some, it’s not having a college degree. For others, it’s having a college degree. For me, it’s age and race. I don’t think that will ever change. But the point is to know this. It introduces you to empathy. Just as how you want people to be empathetic to your insecurities, be empathetic to theirs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another thing – if you work somewhere that’s eating you from the inside-out, leave. It’s not worth it. I know other industries say to stay for ten years, but you’re in an industry that’s barely 30 years old. We’re blessed in the sense that we can leave a company after a year, and get a job the next day. Most people leave, because they got a new job. We’re one of the few communities where, when you hear someone say, “I quit,” you say, “Congratulations.” In any other industry, it’s like, “Oh, shit, what are you going to do now? That sucks. Do you need a place to stay?” Of course, if you think you can change your situation, persevere and sort it out. Don’t just bounce. But when you can’t deal with it anymore, kill it, before it kills you. If you’re in an industry that you love, don’t let anyone drive you away from it. You’re a techie, stand tall.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you’re in an industry that you love, don’t let anyone drive you away from it. You’re a techie, stand tall.&#8221;</p></blockquote>",

Tell me about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m from Colorado. I grew up in Colorado Springs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mom is a doctor and a single mom. How do I describe my upbringing? Colorado Springs is </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">famous for like “Focus on the Family” and super conservative Christians. But I wasn&#8217;t exposed to any of that, I just had my mom, her medical practice, and all her doctor friends. The problem </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with this question is that </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got poisoned as a child, so I don&#8217;t remember anything from before </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">probably thirteen. I have forgotten most of my life actually, I found out recently my husband and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had a wedding that I don’t remember. There are pictures and everything.</span></p>\n<p><b>Holy shit.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So my whole childhood is basically gone. My mom remembers, you can ask her if you want </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[laugh]. The primary answer to that question is I don&#8217;t know, because it&#8217;s gone, all that stuff is </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">just gone. I know I have two brothers and a sister, but I don&#8217;t have a lot of anecdotal things from </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">childhood, or even more recently, because it&#8217;s just not in my brain anymore. My memory, if you </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can call it that, is stored entirely in a combination of other people and various kinds of recordings.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got poisoned as a child, so I don&#8217;t remember anything from before </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">probably thirteen. I have forgotten most of my life actually, I found out recently my husband and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had a wedding that I don’t remember. There are pictures and everything.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><b>So, if you feel comfortable, what happened?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On my tenth birthday, my family­­ so my mom and my little brother, me and then I think two </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">friends, I don&#8217;t know, some small group of people went to a hotel that had a pool to do ten-year-old birthday things.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the hotel was negligent on their maintenance or something, I don&#8217;t remember. There was a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lawsuit, I never read the findings, I was too young. So they were negligent and carbon monoxide </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and chlorine gas and some other gases leaked into the pool area, and my mom and my little </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">brother and me and both my friends were poisoned. But my mom and I got the worst effects, we </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">were poisoned the most. So, my mom and I went from being totally normal to having traumatic </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">brain injuries, but by poison instead of war or football or whatever.</span></p>\n<p><b>How did those injuries manifest in the early years, and how is it continuing to?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has changed over the years. Gotten better and worse. I get attacks of uncontrollable shaking. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My body is usually in pain. I get a ton of migraines, a fuck ton actually. My <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">proprioception</a>, which </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is like, the accurate sensation of where your body is in space, and the position you&#8217;re in is 80 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">percent gone which means my balance and walking have good and bad days. I am basically a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">grab bag of neurological issues: Alice in Wonderland Syndrome to Post-­traumatic Stress </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disorder. It’s hard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I seemed to improve slowly until I was in college, but then when my brain was under stress I got </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a bad relapse. So I guess my junior year in college I was all way back at the bottom. I couldn&#8217;t </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">walk, I was having migraines everyday, I shook constantly. After that I was really bad for several </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">years and I&#8217;ve been inching my way back out of that hole ever since.</span></p>\n<p><b>What about your mom?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mom, you would describe her as like a stroke victim. Even though that&#8217;s not what happened, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that&#8217;s a thing people understand. She basically got a migraine for 8 years straight. She is doing </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">much better now. Still dealing but better.</span></p>\n<p><b>Wow. So you probably don’t remember but, as a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up­­?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mom says I wanted to be a surgeon, which I am now like, &#8220;That is the most ridiculous thing I </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">could have ever thought of.&#8221; But, of course that&#8217;s what I wanted to do. My mom was a doctor </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and her medical practice was very integrated into our lives so of course I wanted to do </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">medicine. I think my initial &#8220;I&#8217;m going to college&#8221; was pre­-med, until I figured out about </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chemistry. I was like, &#8220;ugh, this is horrible.&#8221; Chemistry is the worst. Or at least that’s what I like </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to tell myself. That I had a choice, that I opted out instead of what really happened which is that </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was forced out by my disability.</span></p>\n<p><b>Did you have any idea at that time that you&#8217;d end up in Silicon Valley tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. My BFA is in Theater, Film, and Television Production, so I thought I was going to go into </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Theater. But I got so sick at the end of school that all of my best laid plans were totally ruined. I </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was supposed to go work as an assistant stage manager in Tokyo. But I was too sick, there was </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">no way I could take that job, or any job.</span></p>\n<p><b>So walk me through the winding road that took you to VR.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So after college I was essentially on bed­rest for four years. I shouldn&#8217;t say bed­rest. I was </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">home­bound for four years. Walking to the bathroom made me dizzy so I crawled kinda thing. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So in that time, I started watching <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/art21/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Art21</a>, which is this contemporary art show made by PBS. It&#8217;s </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">so fucking good. It’s a collection of artists talking about their work and their lives and their </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">families and it changed my life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was laying there on the couch at 20 thinking that this painful bullshit was what the rest of my </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">life was going to be like, and I decided, “Fuck it I’m gonna steal ideas from these people.” So I </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">starting copying their work. Andrea Zittel and Ann Hamilton and Vija Celmins and Kara Walker. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These women became my pantheon. Oh and Janine Antoni, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janine_Antoni\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Janine Antoni</a>! She&#8217;s amazing! </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She&#8217;s from the Bahamas and she would place a tightrope right at the horizon and then she </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">would walk across the tightrope on video and every time she took a step the line would just </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">touch the horizon. So good. She also hand spun this huge rope with all these video tapes and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">clothes and just any material donated from her friends and family. Antoni made a rope so I </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">made a rope. Zittel crocheted so I crocheted. Hamilton talked about social concepts in cloth so I </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">talked about computational concepts in cloth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I copied lots of work from Art21 because there was nothing else to do. It was just not what you </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">want to happen right after you get out of college. Like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to get an internship, and I&#8217;ll be </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">out every night and­­—No. You&#8217;re going to lay in bed for four years and be bored.” That was </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">basically the start of like, &#8220;I am an artist now.&#8221; The art was my entire life at that point, I guess it </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">still is.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I finally made my own work it was these brightly­-colored abstract crocheted sculptures the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">size of, ironically, the couch I’d been stuck on. I guess the first time I really showed anything </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was in 2009, with the Armory Show in New York.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was told my thesis work wasn’t art because I made a video game. It wasn’t even a game it was an interactive environment that addressed the contemporary way that we go about knowledge formation. They couldn’t see it. It was weird because I was interested in technology. The work that I was making before, the crochet, was about reenacting computational systems. But they had never seen that either, those works were talked about as “heroic women’s work”. It drove me crazy. The professors never could see crochet as data, as captured information in the shape of a linear thread. But I still graduated, so fuck them.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>*Just* the Armory? [laughter]</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah me and galleries have never been much of a thing. Then I used that work, and the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">credential of that show to apply to grad school. I went to the California College of the Arts over </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on Potrero Hill. That was the first time I was really out of the house everyday by myself in years. I was 24.</span></p>\n<p>Some of it was great. I found a couple professors that were awesome.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It should come as no surprise that I did not fit in well at school. I had just spent 4 years alone with the exception of my boyfriend. I didn&#8217;t know how to human and I was learning to be disabled not just at home in a bubble of my own control but at the school, in classes, on the train etc. Once again I have very few anecdotes of grad school, what with my memory but I know it was both great and really stupid. I got really tough and focused because of school. I am a much better artist now, and I found one professor who I am friends with today who is brilliant and funny and really important to me. But because I wasn&#8217;t great at interacting with the other students, so they started calling me The Borg. They were like, &#8220;But it&#8217;s endearing because we like you,&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No, it&#8217;s socially separating and bullying.&#8221; But they never stopped. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was told my thesis work wasn’t art because I made a video game.

The professors never could see crochet as data, as captured information in the shape of a linear thread. But I still graduated, so fuck them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what happened after that? I got my first job. I was so proud of myself. I worked as an architectural assistant making drawings and writing their blog. I worked there until she couldn&#8217;t afford to pay me anymore. Then I started working for Axis dance company and they&#8217;re in Oakland and they&#8217;re physically integrated dance company and I worked there for almost two years, man, what I thought at the time was going to be a dream job turned out to be awful. Anyway I also wrote for KQED in there, writing about net art, the internet, and video games mostly, and I was doing a lot of both digital drawing and ink on paper which both turned into making gifs and prints and comic books. It was around that time, in 2013, I started making YouTube videos too. Again copying existing work I liked from Mike Rugnetta and PBS Idea Channel. Huh, twice now PBS has been foundational to my art. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The videos started as talking head style technology and cultural criticism pieces plastered with wild editing. It was a great way to restart with video. I had experience editing short films and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">features from college but the show, self-titled </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BlinkPopShift</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, also leaned hard on the writing and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">research skills I forged at grad school and KQED. It became a way to think across tech and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">culture and art and science the same way I had been exploring in my masters thesis, but now </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">everyone, not just the limited pov’s of my professors, could see the result. Simultaneously I built </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a whole body of work exclusively on my phone, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still Lives</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> series, using a combination of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">photogrammetry and various gif making apps.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I became super immersed in Youtube so I went to <a href=\"http://vidcon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vidcon</a> and met Mike Rugnetta and Vi Hart </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and Malia Moss who all turned out to amazing friends and collaborators. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few months later I got a call from Vi asking “Hey, do you think you could build a VR camera?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Yeah sure, I don&#8217;t see why not. That doesn&#8217;t seem that hard.&#8221; And I was right, I mean it took months of work and cameras melting and trial and error and math but I did it.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;A few months later I got a call from Vi asking “Hey, do you think you could build a VR camera?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Yeah sure, I don&#8217;t see why not. That doesn&#8217;t seem that hard.&#8221; And I was right, I mean it took months of work and cameras melting and trial and error and math but I did it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>So you just&#8230; made a VR camera?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I mean, yeah. We, along with Andrea Hawksley, the three horsemen of eleVR, have been </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">working on various projects in VR, AR, and mixed reality every since. Vi’d hired me to work at </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the then Communications Design Group, Alan Kay’s Research Lab at SAP. Working for an </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">open lab is great because with no pressure to publish traditional papers, we can write up </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">everything on our blog for anyone to read.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have to say I was so happy when fully spherical, auto-stitching cameras came on the market </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and I didn&#8217;t have to actually build them by hand with a fucking hot glue gun anymore, which was </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fun but also so tedious. I focus on studying how immersion works and how aesthetic techniques </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">communicate to viewers. Recently I’ve been building the foundation of spherical </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cinematography so I can use that knowledge when designing immersive web systems.</span></p>\n<p><b>What excites you about that space?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making hybrid reality projects where linkages are no longer limited to computers and screens. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I write or make art, I like to put stuff everywhere but computers in their current conception </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">don’t allow for creative messes. Sure, you can barf icons all over your desktop, but that&#8217;s not a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">creative mess. It feels heavy and in need of “organization.” Good messes feed my creativity </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">through serendipity and flexibility. But my physical messes don’t have search for when I know </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exactly which bit of red paper has to go on the collage next. That divide between the physical </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and the digital will close, ‘cause me and my vice grip say so.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that also means taking seriously the considerations of what the body wants. Because like, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we are not fingers with eyes and ear holes. The way we do knowledge creation has a lot to do </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with this flappy meat thing. We completely disregard its wants and needs and its ideas about the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">world for what, a touch screen? This is the most embodied form of computational media that we </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have? Pinch and zoom and swipe and tap? Gross. There&#8217;s so much touch you can&#8217;t get in the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">little rectangles we carry around everywhere, it drives me crazy.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I write or make art, I like to put stuff everywhere but computers in their current conception </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">don’t allow for creative messes.

But when I&#8217;m out of my bubble it&#8217;s really hard because my work, and probably </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">my personality too, is hard to parse as either or, as art or tech, as artist or researcher. A good </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">example is that I don’t go to VR meetups any more. Everyone was too newness focused. There </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was no bubbling curiosity, no juicy conversation. It was just, sorry to say it but, a bunch of white </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dudes being boring.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Ugh, tech Industry problems.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are the biggest motivators behind your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I make art for two people, which people do not like to hear, but it&#8217;s true. I make sculpture for </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steve Sedlmayr, my husband, who is such a fucking treasure, we’re 12 years this summer, and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I make video for Vi Hart, who is one of my best friends and my boss. That&#8217;s it. The sculptural </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">work is for him and the video work is for her. When I can make either of them tilt their head or </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">think &#8220;What is that?&#8221; or smile or laugh or say “Yes. More please,” that&#8217;s winning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is definitely a subtle pressure from social media to care about a bigger audience and I do </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have a small audience online. Some people watch the videos online, and some people read the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stuff that I publish, and that&#8217;s great but I don&#8217;t crave their opinions. For me, seeing Vi watch a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">video and afterward be like, &#8220;Damn!&#8221; That&#8217;s my chocolate sundae.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am the most traditionally “visual art” person there, which I find funny </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">since in grad school I was the most “tech” person, but being a weird inbetweener is kinda our </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">thing at the lab.

What are your thoughts on the state of tech in 2016, both the tech that you considered tech and the tech that a lot of people consider tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tech is so confusing. What even is the technology industry? Are search engines and camera </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">manufacturers and Crispr therapies and video games really in the same industry? I feel like we </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">use “the tech industry” the same way people used to “big business.” What is that thing I hear </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">over and over about Uber? “Uber is a taxi company, not a tech company.” Bakers with online </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">delivery are still bakers.

My team and I went to the first Oculus Connect, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and there was an open panel, and it was being live streamed on the internet.

Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m Canadian. I was born and raised in Ottawa, Ontario—the capital of Canada. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born to a quite young, single, soon-to-be-lesbian mother (she came out when she was three months pregnant) who had just left home. She didn&#8217;t know what the heck she was doing but had me anyway. There were not a lot of lesbians having children in the 70s, those who had them were coming out of straight marriages and had to be careful not to get their kids taken away, so she was a rare bird and it meant I also didn&#8217;t know a lot of other kids that had queer parents. So, my early years were unique in that way.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was born to a quite young, single, soon-to-be-lesbian mother (she came out when she was three months pregnant) who had just left home.

So, my early years were unique in that way.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>My mom was also an activist, feminist, and non-traditional woman (might be read as butch but never identified as such). She drove a taxi, did woodworking and construction, she DJ’d queer and women’s dances, and she was very active in Ottawa socially and politically. She was a role model for doing all sorts of different jobs and not knowing how it will all add up later.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She was also strong in math and logical thinking and that’s something I’m grateful for.  We’d play games at the grocery store doing the math on which size of a product was the best deal for the money. This was fun for me and a necessity for her. She didn&#8217;t earn much money so </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we never had a lot of stuff as I was growing up. My grandparents were my primary source of school supplies, clothes, toys, and candy, not my mom. She was on social assistance or earning a very low income so I was never certain I was going to go to university.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I earned good grades and figured there might be scholarships. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My first 3 years of high school I was trying to fast track—my plan was to go to Queens University and be a lawyer, because I liked to argue. I was fast-tracking to do high school in four years instead of five by just doing the required classes instead of any electives so that I could get out of there faster, both away from my mom but also I needed to get the heck out of the country high school I was going to. Instead, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I ran away from home at 17 and my school track slowed down. I ended up splitting my last year of course work back into a two year spread so I was only half time and just managed to complete high school while on social assistance. I filled out the university applications like everyone else, because it was free to do from high school, but I didn’t know how to follow up with interviews for the programs I applied to (film and animation) and I had no idea about student loans so I didn’t get into any of my choices.</span></i></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We never had a lot of stuff as I was growing up.

There I also learned about student loans and I applied again to University the next year. I was trying to get into film animation. I had always really wanted to make animated films but I couldn&#8217;t get into that program because I&#8217;d never taken enough art to have a portfolio. It was kind of a bummer because it&#8217;s like “I&#8217;m going to pay you for this degree, can&#8217;t I learn?” I had been drawing and doing comics my whole life, but not with any kind of formal training. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I ended up going into Women&#8217;s Studies because that&#8217;s what accepted me and I did a year and half of Women&#8217;s Studies. Then I dropped out when it got hard because I didn&#8217;t actually have any study skills. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did really well in high school without having to try very hard and suddenly, in university, I didn&#8217;t—I reached the limits of what I knew how to do off the top of my head. So I freaked out and dropped out and spent the next 10 years doing minimum wage jobs and evading loan collectors.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> That&#8217;s the early years.</span></p>\n<p><b>At that point, I’m assuming you had absolutely no idea you&#8217;d be in Silicon Valley?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh my god no! I didn&#8217;t have any idea I&#8217;d be in Silicon Valley—didn’t even really think about its existence. I first was introduced to it in 2008 when I came out here to do an internship at Mozilla, which was across the road from the Google Mountain View campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went back to school in 2005. I was turning 30. I was like, I need a job where I can get my teeth fixed. I figured I&#8217;d go punch a clock at IBM or something and have a decent middle-class income.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And probably still live in Toronto, which is where I lived and went to school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discovering Open Source, getting involved with Mozilla, and then coming out here with a high-paying internship and being a part of the tech boom happening here—it&#8217;s nothing I could have imagined. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I tried to move to San Francisco in 1997 as a young, broke queer. I worked under the table at a cafe and made $100 a week, which was barely enough to eat a Snickers bar for dinner and take the bus to work the next day.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I didn&#8217;t know how to be an illegal alien here, had no safety net, and was not making enough money. At that same time a lot of my friends were being evicted, because of the first dotcom boom, and people were losing their housing, and moving further and further away from Mission/Valencia area. I was here for three or four weeks, and then had to go back to Canada, and go back to my own minimum wage jobs there. So I always wanted to come back and try again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the Mozilla job offer came through, I realized Mozilla would pay for me to move, and take care of my work visa, and I’d have health care. It felt like I had a red carpet rolled out for me returning. But I got back here to something akin to a funeral, for what San Francisco was. And again, people are being evicted, and there’s all this loss of radical queer &amp; artists community. Then the housing market crashed. Everyone except for people in my industry was feeling it. At my job, we were still getting yearly raises.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I went back to school in 2005. I was turning 30. I was like, I need a job where I can get my teeth fixed.

How jarring was it for you going from—I saw when I was stalking you online that six years ago you were making less than 10k a year, you grew up in poverty—and now you&#8217;re living a different life?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s an interesting trajectory there. I was very much—and my mom was like this too, spend everything you&#8217;ve got. You get a check and you spend it. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some ways, I was always very comforted by not having any money, because then I couldn&#8217;t sabotage it or mess it up. It was like, &#8216;I&#8217;ve spent all the money I&#8217;m going to spend, I have whatever groceries that are in my fridge, I have my bus pass in my pocket, I have my carton of cigarettes&#8217; (when I smoked). I just took care of the things that were essential and then that was it.</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There was nothing else to worry about.</span></i> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I knew where to get free food. There is a certain ease to being broke when all your friends are also broke.  Everything we did for fun was free or super cheap. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got a job offer at the end of my internship. I had been getting paid $5,000 a month to be an intern and I was saving it up to pay for the last year of school (eating 15 free meals a week at Google was instrumental in saving $), and I got a job offer of $60,000 for my first year out of school. To know that I was going back to school to finish up eight months and then to have a job right after, that paid so well, blew my mind. My mom was at the top level of her current career in government. She was—I should have mentioned this, she went back to school as soon as I left home at seventeen and she got a bachelor&#8217;s and a master&#8217;s really quick and then worked herself back into a middle class financial situation. She had grown up middle class. She got herself back into that and her partner, who she&#8217;s been with for 30 years now, comes from a  middle class background—two parents who are both PhD English professors, so they have a very comfortable life. They&#8217;re very thoughtful and conscious people who get to live very well. They don&#8217;t live extravagantly or anything, but they also make good money. And my mom, I think, has managed to probably catch up for all those years of struggling financially.  She&#8217;s supposed to retire in the next couple of years and I’m watching how that works out for her since she’s my main role model. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I observed her doing that, I observed another person who did that—going back to school then shooting up into a middle class job after not having money—and that was why I went back to school for a bachelor’s degree. I was also thinking &#8220;I&#8217;m doing it eight years earlier than my mom, so maybe I get eight years of advantage.&#8221; And I really did. I came out of the four year degree with a $60,000 job offer. My mom was making $92,000 at her top level government job. So I thought &#8220;Wow, I really am fast-tracking.&#8221;</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I tried to move to San Francisco in 1997 as a young, broke queer. I worked under the table at a cafe and made $100 a week, which was barely enough to eat a Snickers bar for dinner and take the bus to work the next day.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The first couple of years I could pretend I still lived on $20,000 a year and feel like I was doing really good, and I fast-tracked paying off all my debts. My moms had to lend me money to do this degree because I had defaulted on student loans when I was 20 and I couldn&#8217;t access any student loans this time around. They were giving me a monthly stipend and paying my tuition and the deal was I&#8217;d pay them back half of their total spend, with no interest, which was an amazing deal.  I owed them $27,000 coming out of school, and I payed that all back in the first year. I also payed back $15,000 worth of credit card debt from supplementing working 20 hours while being in school full time.  Then I had a list of things I had to take care of. I had to get a bunch of crowns on my teeth because I had a ton of root canals with only temporary fillings on them. Probably $7000 went into my teeth in the first couple years. I also wanted to get top surgery more than anything in the world, so I did that in 2010.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was debt free for exactly one month before my then-partner and I, bought a house in 2011. I signed my name on a $457,000 mortgage. I was literally debt free for one month. I went on a shopping spree in New York and got some new jeans and an expensive shirt and was like, &#8220;Woo-hoo. I don&#8217;t have to carry any debt this month!&#8221; and then we bought a house in San Francisco.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After we bought a house I did the last thing on my “perfect world” wish list which was getting Lasik and now I&#8217;m like a bionic person. I remember a time when I thought, &#8220;all I want is to be able to always have cigarettes and buy a beer at the end of the work day.&#8221; Now things are different. I don&#8217;t want those things anymore. I make all this money. What am I going to do with it? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m trying to learn how to do good things with money. I spend a lot of time trying to figure that out. I can just give money away. I pay more than half of things when I make more than somebody. For example, with my current roommate situation, we split the rent based on our respective incomes.  We don&#8217;t just split the rent in half because she makes a third of what I make. It&#8217;s nice to be able to do that. I love buying people dinner. I spend a lot of money on travel too, for me and also for others. That was totally new to me, jumping into this class. I’ve been to Vietnam, Mexico twice, Europe a handful of times. I had previously left the continent once when I was 15 on a school trip to London &amp; Paris that my mom borrowed $1500 from my grandparents to pay for and they never let her forget it. I also do this thing called vacation, where you go away and read books and lay in sunshine. I learned how to do that and how to travel in different countries.  I got a first-class upgrade once. It was to my grandmother&#8217;s funeral, so I was a little bit like, &#8220;I&#8217;m so excited to fly first-class, but it&#8217;s a red-eye and I should be sleeping, but I can&#8217;t sleep because we&#8217;re getting cookies on a plane! It&#8217;s like two in the morning and I&#8217;m going to eat these cookies and watch all the free movies!&#8221;</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I feel like I&#8217;m in this industry because I want to shovel out as many resources as possible from its coffers but also so that I can make a getaway after a few more years and then me and all my people who don&#8217;t make this kind of money, who don&#8217;t have retirement plans, who don&#8217;t have this kind of financial stability, we get to go have a good life somewhere quiet. I don&#8217;t believe in doing this just for me. I have to do this for other people too, as many as I can. It&#8217;s not even enough. The wealth gap is growing so fast and even with the money I’m personally making, I can’t stop it or feel like I’m doing enough to help others.  Sometimes I want to run away from making money, go back to when things were easier and I wasn&#8217;t part of a very hated industry.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I used to just road trip around Canada and the US.

What is your experience straddling communities of different levels of privilege. One being tech, and others being the queer/activist communities. Especially in San Francisco. What is that like for you?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving to San Francisco and having most people not know me here before I arrived with a job in tech—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sometimes I feel really ashamed. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I went back to school so I could fix my teeth, and I come here and it doesn&#8217;t matter who I am inside. I just look like a douchebag to people who don&#8217;t know me,&#8221; and that&#8217;s—and not only because I work in tech, but because I pass as a white guy to most strangers. There&#8217;s all these ways in which nobody sees the complexities and in some circumstances those complexities don&#8217;t matter. I just have to live with that.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People are going to make the judgements they are going to make but it&#8217;s scary in San Francisco because it&#8217;s a super radical activist community that I wanted to come out and be a part of but I tiptoed around it for the first couple years because I was afraid people weren&#8217;t going to like me. I went back to school in software development because I liked computers my whole life and was pretty confident with them but also because I thought it would be a good skill to bring back to my communities. I had worked with some artist nonprofits in Toronto and they&#8217;re using the oldest computers, and they&#8217;re locked into proprietary software they can&#8217;t update because they can&#8217;t afford to update it. There&#8217;s just all these inefficiencies within non-profits because of a lack of tech fluency, and I was always the person who could fix computers or took a natural shine to that kind of stuff, so I thought why don&#8217;t I enhance that in what I go back to school for. It seemed like a good fit, I&#8217;ve always liked computers, I was the kind of person if I went to someone&#8217;s house and they had a computer- because I didn&#8217;t have my own computer until 2003. If I went to someone&#8217;s house and they had a computer I&#8217;d be like “oh can I hop on your computer?” When I got here I joined this queer SF mailing list and I would send messages saying, &#8220;Hey, if anybody wants to learn programming, I&#8217;d love to teach you what I know.&#8221; Nobody took me up on it. Nobody was interested. And nobody was getting mad at me for it either, but it just felt like I shouted to the dark, and I didn&#8217;t really understand why.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Sometimes I feel really ashamed.

And I want that for people. So I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah,&#8221; and then they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;But I hate computers,&#8221; and say, &#8220;Well, then I don&#8217;t know if I can help you.&#8221; You have to like this stuff a little bit or find at least some part of it interesting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then I started to wonder if maybe my role isn&#8217;t necessarily to help with the actual technology, even though I do as much as possible, like I&#8217;ll get used laptops from my workplace to people for whom a 2 year old laptop is a game changer, repurpose older model cell phones. There are ways in which I can help out in random instances with hardware, sometimes maybe I help someone with a website, though I don&#8217;t have much time to do that now that I work so much. These days it seems like the way I can help my community more is often through straight up funding and spreading fundraising asks to my networks which now contain more people who are outside of queer &amp; activist communities—so I can help tap new sources.</span></p>\n<p><b>Personally I&#8217;m curious, as someone—I grew up in a tiny town, moved here with $40, was broke as shit for a long time. And now I make a good living, and I found success to a degree. And the most prominent feeling from the entire experience, that I still experience today, is guilt. I&#8217;m really curious if you feel that too?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. Oh yeah, absolutely, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel guilty. I managed to get myself a do-over and things went really well and I didn&#8217;t feel like I could take any pride in what I had done. Other people tell me I should, but I can&#8217;t. I have a really hard time with doing well while other people are suffering or struggling, and yet, at the same time, when I was broke, it wasn&#8217;t fun.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t miss that stress. I&#8217;m still so aware of some of that stress. I have the newest car now. I got a used Prius, a 2009, and it always starts. I get to do preventive maintenance on it, which no car I’d ever owned before got. I always had cars with weird electrical problems, horns that didn’t work, shot brakes, no heat, just stressful breakdowns waiting to happen around every corner.  It costs a lot more to have a car like that than it costs me to have this 2009 car but I would never have been able to qualify for a car loan before now.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I felt a lot of guilt when a friend of mine said, &#8220;You forget what it&#8217;s like to not have money,&#8221; or when I mention things like retirement. That&#8217;s the new thing I want to start focusing on, and I want to figure out ways of building a collective retirement fund or otherwise making sure that I&#8217;m not just saving for individual private success because my retirement is not going to be very fulfilling if my friends aren&#8217;t there. We don&#8217;t have a lot of ways to talk about this kind of stuff with people and I have a tendency to just try to give stuff away rather than be the person who has more. I&#8217;m not 100% sure that&#8217;s the best thing to do, but it&#8217;s all I know right now.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;When I was young and broke and people said how rich people have problems too, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Whatever. They have money. I don&#8217;t believe you.&#8221; And now I make what to me is a ridiculous amount of money and I’m feeling that struggle to be happy. To be clear, some of the things I need to work on for my own happiness will exist at any income level but some of the factors are a direct result of being in such a different place than many of my peers.

When we first got together, I was making almost as much as she was and by the time we split up I was making twice what she is. Every year I would come home and say I got a raise—every year that I got a raise—her face would just fall. She would be saying, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s really good for you,&#8221; but her entire face belied what she was saying because it was so obviously really hard for her to hear that and it was hard for me too. She should have been getting raises.  But did I wish I did not do it—not make more money, not get a raise, not bring that into our home and into our community? I don&#8217;t know. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently I have started to say I have five years left in this industry because I’m having a really hard time with the stress. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was young and broke and people said how rich people have problems too, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Whatever.

Well, they probably never had to live on less.</b></p>\n<p>I think they probably are saving a lot of money and not spending a lot of money. But that they consider themselves as not having a lot of money. Which isn&#8217;t how I approach it at all. I really had to learn how to save money and to learn to protect my savings account from myself. You know, the me that likes to just spend all the money so I don&#8217;t have to worry about fucking up with the money? Now I have learned to save money and then I have this little savings account that is growing with these automatic deposits and it got to a size where I was like, okay now I want to protect it—I don&#8217;t want to touch it. But I had never had that ability before to, like, put money aside and not touch it. I think that people who came up with money or who came up with security don&#8217;t worry about money like this—especially the tech guys who behave like &#8220;It&#8217;s not even about money. I just do it because I love it.&#8221; I call bullshit on that. You&#8217;re making money doing it! I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;d be doing it if you also had to scramble for your next meal or didn&#8217;t have power and literally couldn&#8217;t do it because you didn&#8217;t have power. I think that they have a much more compartmentalized idea of budgeting and saving and things that let them think what they&#8217;re living on is what they have instead of counting their total wealth.  Not to mention anyone who might have someone preparing their meals, cleaning their home, doing their laundry, or raising their kids.</p>\n<p><b>Yeah.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine that saying:  It takes money to make money. For me, making money was a bit of a slippery slope at first because I was still doing things like spending a lot of money on a credit card and then paying it off with my next paycheck. I still haven&#8217;t figured out how to have the money for something I want to buy before I buy it.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. It sounds like we have very similar relationships to money [laughter]. </b></p>\n<p><b>Tell me more about the Ascend project.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was my attempt to try to scale up what happened to me. I got involved in Open Source at Mozilla through school. I was a student at the time and I got to work on fixing bugs and was supported and grew into being a respected contributor to the Mozilla Project through continually showing up. That helped me secure an internship which helped me get my first tech job which helped me get to the $60,000 a year new grad gig. With all these code schools coming up, that were charging people, especially people coming from the underrepresented populations who are desperate for an opportunity to get a little bit of this tech money, it looked very predatory to me, and it still does. I wanted to see if I could do something where I could replicate what worked for me. Which was that you get involved, you get a chance to be free to do nothing but learn all day how to contribute to Open Source. Because contributing to Open Source is often a really important marker for someone who wants to try to break into a job in technology. And that&#8217;s often reserved for people who have this thing called &#8220;spare time,&#8221; which is really helped by someone else doing your laundry, cooking your dinner, and raising your kids. Right? This program was inspired by the thinking: what if we paid people to have the time to sit all day in a guided environment like I had with my teacher in school—where their only job is to learn how to be a contributor to open source to make a technical contribution by the end of six weeks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had an executive at Mozilla who was very supportive of my plan. We would pay participants an honorarium, cover childcare as needed, transit, we provided breakfast &amp; lunch, we provide a work space, we provided laptops that they would get to keep after the 6 weeks were up and then we walked them through a lot of the stuff that I went through. I did a 12 or 13 week college course where I was in class once a week and then I did the project work in my own time. Ascend was an accelerator so we did six weeks, five days a week, nine to five. I wanted it to be only for people of color and that didn&#8217;t happen mostly for reasons of time and then also my own limits of knowledge &amp; connection with Portland. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had just read a study by the woman who wrote Unlocking the Clubhouse about women in CS and she did a second follow up study on Latinos and Blacks in tech based on L.A. high school students and she highlighted how those populations are actively dissuaded from getting involved in CS at all. Seriously—like &#8220;this isn&#8217;t for you.&#8221; I definitely wanted to work with people who are being told that they shouldn&#8217;t be here.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was running it in Portland because Mozilla had an office in Portland. Immediately people were making fun of me for trying to do something that was reaching out to people of color in Portland because it&#8217;s 73% white. If it&#8217;s 73% white, that means there are people of color there and I only needed 20 people, so I still thought “this is possible.” I keynoted at a local open source conference to announce it. I was also able to hire a friend who was a WordPress developer and small business owner in Portland. She was a local person and she had freelancing skills I didn&#8217;t have so I asked her to come co-lead with me and bring those areas into the curriculum too. She also happens to be a black lesbian woman in tech. It seemed wise to have a good local role model/mentor because I was going to come in and teach and then go back to San Francisco.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I had a manager who was really great. He was very clear about calling me she, as I had asked, and he would do what I call “pronoun showdowns” on my behalf which is when my manager is calling me ‘she’ to someone who&#8217;s calling me ‘he’ and they just go back and forth like that until the other person&#8217;s on board. I love watching other people do that instead of having to do it myself.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I put the call out and I got 43 applicants and I had budget for 20 participants. I interviewed everybody who made it past a programming challenge (free online Javascript course) in order to select people. Out of 20 people, 18 completed the program. 1 of them had to go back to Mexico to deal with a family situation and then for immigration reasons was not able to return to Portland to complete. Another person I had to ask to leave the program because he wasn&#8217;t pulling his weight. He was falling asleep in class and not really participating. He just wasn&#8217;t at a level of maturity to be able to do the self-directed work that was required in this program. We were there to support and also to expose them to stuff and to try to help them connect the dots, but it was really a guided self-learning space. That was intentional so that each person was learning at their own pace, the idea being that wherever they came in at, six weeks later they were six weeks further from that point in terms of having picked up new skills. It was not the goal that they all hit each milestone in the same way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It ended up being a really great cohort. There were a range of ages. I discovered a whole new demographic of people that I hadn&#8217;t even considered when it comes to not getting great opportunities in tech, which is women over 45 who already have experience in technology but cannot get interviews to save their lives because it&#8217;s like they disappeared from the view of anyone looking at resumes. The only advice I could give them was not to put the year they graduated on their resumes. We had three trans women and one trans man. We had 15 women and 5 men. Half the group were people of color. It was a mix of class backgrounds—some people who were actively street involved. The guy that I had to ask to leave was homeless at the time and when we talked about it not being a good fit he said, &#8220;It&#8217;s because I&#8217;m on the street.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;No, actually, it&#8217;s not just that. We asked you not to fall asleep in the classroom because it&#8217;s hard on the other 19 people to watch you sleeping while they&#8217;re trying to learn. We asked you to leave the classroom if you couldn’t stay awake and we provided a room where you could nap. You couldn’t stand up and go to the nap room and have a nap.&#8221; It was really that he wasn&#8217;t able to grab the opportunity this time around. He&#8217;s a really smart guy, and I hope there will be other opportunities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had lined up a few internships for these folks to apply to after. There were a couple internships at a place called Urban Airship. It was intentional that it be two so that the graduates could lean on each other and not be the only non-traditional intern coming in off the street. Outreachy had some internship spots, which is a Open Source Intern Project for non-traditional and non-student people. Three of the participants got into those. One of the women who did the program worked at AgileBits. She helped a couple of people get jobs there afterward. So there&#8217;s a pretty decent amount of success for folks that did the program. What&#8217;s sad to me, actually, is that the three trans women who did the program, not one of them got an internship or job out of this. And that&#8217;s something, if I could do it again, I would try to focus more on ways to move the needle on that segment of the population.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got involved in women in tech stuff as soon as I got here and each time there’s that moment where I walk into the room of all the other women and now, when that happens, usually I know at least one person there so it normalizes it pretty quickly if another woman shows she is being accepting of my presence there. Initially in the first couple of years it was really hard to go to those spaces and to hope I would connect with a friendly person who would recognize that I&#8217;m just a different kind of woman and be my friend, or just be friendly to me.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Yeah. That segues into something I&#8217;m curious about. Your particular experience being genderqueer in tech—like I read the blog post about the Pinterest bathroom incident and your response to that.

At Mozilla I got to know several of the leaders in the project through the work I did at Seneca College because a lot of them happened to live in Toronto, some were even from Ottawa and we were all relatively close in age which provided the comfort of shared cultural history that Canadians of a certain age will have. They were all very geeky, friendly straight people, so I came into Mozilla with a safety net of sorts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I worked in the Bay Area office,  I shared more information about who I was and what I valued which was usually well received. There was a lot of crossover with where I was coming from in terms of queer/feminist/anti-capitalist beliefs and the values of Open Source. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had a manager who was really great.

Once at a women in CS conference, sitting in a session, this woman turned to me and asked, &#8220;Why are you here?&#8221; I think she honestly thought she was kindly asking a man why he was at women&#8217;s conference. Stuff like that still happens.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I use a method of proximity and persistent attendance to build up relationships with people.  I suppose we all do that, I’m just doing it with the additional effort of being seen for more than my initial appearance. Once at a women in CS conference, sitting in a session, this woman turned to me and asked, &#8220;Why are you here?&#8221; I think she honestly thought she was kindly asking a man why he was at women&#8217;s conference. Stuff like that still happens.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wrote that email to the women@ list at a couple of months into being at Pinterest and we have now hired more women so there are going to be women in my office who don&#8217;t know about that email, who don&#8217;t know me, and that always makes me nervous because that means over time the risk of someone being scared continues to be a possibility—actually, it might have happened the other day. I came to the office from the gym because we have a single stall, gender-neutral shower, which is really great. It&#8217;s a solo shower, so I don&#8217;t have to worry about using our gendered showers because I wouldn&#8217;t actually feel comfortable being in the woman&#8217;s shower as it&#8217;s a shared space with a bunch of stalls and then a common change room.  While I use women’s change rooms as needed in public gyms and pools, that&#8217;s not comfortable for me at work, even though some of my coworkers use my gym and we&#8217;ve run into each other there. Anyway, there were no towels in my shower—I call it my shower—so I went to the woman&#8217;s shower room and stuck my head in to see if there were towels and there were two people in there, where one of them was—I don&#8217;t know how naked she was, but she had a towel on at least some part of her. The other was somebody I knew so I asked her, &#8220;Do you have any towels because there&#8217;s none—&#8221; I said, &#8220;There&#8217;s none in the other one.&#8221; Afterwards I realized that was going to sound to the other woman like a man stuck his head into the room and asked for a towel. That bugged me for a little while, because I get frustrated with not being perceived as how I am inside but I have to let it go. I can&#8217;t take it back. Little moments like that can throw off my day sometimes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s this whole thing here about, &#8220;Be your authentic self.&#8221; The longer I&#8217;m here, meaning in the tech industry, and the longer I&#8217;m at Pinterest, and the more I get to know people and feel confident in the value I provide in the job that I do, the more I get to be my authentic self. — </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly, even at Mozilla, where I felt like I was a fairly visible and outspoken contributor, and a leader on some initiatives, I was maybe 10% of my “authentic self.” There&#8217;s a part of me that&#8217;s like, &#8220;You can&#8217;t handle an authentic me in this workplace, you really don&#8217;t want it. It would be distracting at best. It would be horrifying, maybe, at worst because I am radically opposed to a lot of the norms you take for granted and if I was speaking about that all the time I’d be alienating you instead of you alienating me all the time.&#8221;  I’d rather take the hit and be the outlier than make other people uncomfortable. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I&#8217;m being 10% of myself and that is enough to get people thinking I&#8217;m this eccentric person or this unique character, but it also does draws certain people in which can feel nice.  That helps me identify the folks I can create and dream a brighter future with.</span></p>\n<p><b>Let&#8217;s go macro for a second. How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? What excites you? What frustrates you? What would you like to see change?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the things that excites me, actually it&#8217;s something that Pinterest is doing. There are people here who are tasked with building up Pinterest’s being a good corporate citizen. It feels very genuine. If we can’t immediately destroy capitalism, at least people can work to make their organizations be good corporate citizens and yet a lot of companies aren&#8217;t even doing this. Pinterest does a lot of outreach and ground work in several communities in SOMA. We provide volunteers for meal service at a nearby soup kitchen. There are bi-weekly meals-on-wheels deliveries to seniors living in SROs in the Tenderloin as part of our new hire onboarding.  I&#8217;m part of a group of engineers who started a computer club at Bessie Carmichael, a middle school down the street where 95% of the kids are on free lunch programs and we’re showing up and trying to build relationships &amp; mentoring as well as just showing the kids that there are non-family adults who care about them. Things like that give me hope that there&#8217;s some model for accountability among tech businesses in San Francisco.  To the extent that these types of programs help on the daily, we’re engaged and there’s never a question that it’s the right thing to do.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Honestly, even at Mozilla, where I felt like I was a fairly visible and outspoken contributor, and a leader on some initiatives, I was maybe 10% of my “authentic self.” There&#8217;s a part of me that&#8217;s like, &#8220;You can&#8217;t handle an authentic me in this workplace, you really don&#8217;t want it.

But here it&#8217;s being done in a way that&#8217;s very core to the company&#8217;s values and considering the size of the company and that they aren’t public yet, it gives me hope that this is going to be ingrained aspect of this company’s culture. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So then there’s the other side which is that </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a lot of technology in Silicon Valley is being invented for the convenience of the 10% who are making good money. That&#8217;s got to stop. When are people going to try to solve real problems? I&#8217;m really disappointed that all these people who have all these fancy degrees that they hold over the rest of our heads aren&#8217;t doing anything that&#8217;s more beneficial to more people.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also people keep saying, &#8220;Oh the bubble&#8217;s going to burst, the bubble&#8217;s going to burst.&#8221; I do want there to come a time where tech jobs aren&#8217;t so inflated in value. I would be happy to be earning $60,000 a year in a town where that was enough to be comfortable and housing costs were secure so that more people could also have $60,000 incomes and cities weren’t being overrun &amp; overpriced because they&#8217;re the nexus of high-risk, high-yield startups. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was talking with someone last night in regards to the homelessness crisis in SF.  We’ve been going out in the mornings to try (unsuccessfully) to stop the tent sweeps. Where are those people supposed to go? Why isn&#8217;t anyone taking Uber&#8217;s model and making land grabs of unattended and abandoned lots in San Francisco? Build tiny houses on them and just say, &#8220;Oh yeah. It&#8217;s like Uber for homeless people.&#8221; It&#8217;s housing. Real, cheap houses. And if someone who owns this abandoned land wants to actually do something with it, fine we&#8217;ll move. But until that point, it&#8217;s housing, and it&#8217;s safe, and it&#8217;s clean, and I don&#8217;t know, something really disruptive. It&#8217;s not specifically a tech thing. Actually, here&#8217;s a good one for tech. Why hasn&#8217;t anybody figured out yet how to make a containment system that police can use to stop people from hurting themselves or others without killing them? That&#8217;s a great technology problem. Bring on the hackathon for that.</span></p>\n<p><b>Are there social good hackathons yet?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. There actually is one called Hack For Social Good. The thing about hackathons is that—and I have been in and organized them even— you don&#8217;t get a lot done in a weekend that actually can persist beyond that weekend demo. Also, the organizations you&#8217;re trying to create for sometimes don&#8217;t know how to scope what they want or what they need into a small enough project for a weekend of strangers skill-sharing. It&#8217;s great for getting ideas, and I think people were using them originally as a way to kick off their next start-up or application and then they trickled down into the underrepresented communities as this way for people to network and maybe learn skills.  Maven has done some great hackathons for LGBTQ youth and nonprofits who work with them where several folks have gotten a leg up into securing work in tech afterwards.  That’s a positive outcome, even if the hackathons themselves are mostly prototyping.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;A lot of technology in Silicon Valley is being invented for the convenience of the 10% who are making good money.

I feel like your whole interview is an answer to this question but I just want to see what you say. [laughter]</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I bring sort of a socialist-communist perspective to things so that right there kind of changes a little bit of power dynamics that might exist that just don&#8217;t exist for me or that I don&#8217;t care to perpetuate. The feedback I get is that makes me really fun to work with and maybe that helps shape the culture in positive ways since by default I’m always dreaming of how we can do things in ways that are inclusive of the most people.  I like pulling people in to help me on—for example, a week long tech camp for LGBTQ youth. I&#8217;ll just tell the whole company what I&#8217;m doing and why it matters. Then I&#8217;ll get these people out of nowhere who will say they want to help. When they help, it&#8217;s transformative for them.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I really want, and what&#8217;s really at the bottom of anything I do, is I really want to transfer power and resources to places where those are limited and yet to never be the bottleneck of this transfer happening. I do stuff in a scrappy grassroots ways, so I&#8217;m teaching people to fish as I go.  I hope I’ll get better and better at that. Anything I do, like the Ascend Project for example everything about Ascend is in a public git repo so anybody could take our materials &amp; notes and go make a similar project happen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I really admire the programs and organizations that were started in the 60s &amp; 70s that still exist today, and I spend a lot of time thinking about, &#8220;How do we do that now? Do we do that now? Is it happening and I’m not noticing it? Are we capable of creating lasting models for social justice? Do we need institutions?&#8221; Silicon Valley is trying to convince us everything should be “move fast and break things” but when you&#8217;re dealing with people who are marginalized surprise and breaking things can be very destabilizing.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really important to recognize that people might come into this at any point in their lives. We should be always be empowered to not know what we want to do in our 20s and still get to learn new jobs have dignity, autonomy, and opportunities for mastery of skills. Anyone at any age should be able to do what I do.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>What do you see yourself doing in five or ten years?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five years from now I want to have my own business and be teaching in some capacity. I want to do the Ascend project but as a business—where I&#8217;m able to fund running a training center for folks to be learning tech skills on the job while we deliver products perhaps in partnership with federal government. Trainees can become worker/owners or go start their own thing—like take a couple of clients and go start their own thing because not everybody&#8217;s able to or wants to work for someone. Some people really need to be able to work from home or to have more flexibility and so creating opportunities for that is also a priority to me. </span></p>\n<p><b>My last question for you—this one&#8217;s complicated for you. Because normally my last question for folks is like, &#8220;What advice would you give to folks who kind of come from similar backgrounds or life experiences or who are hoping to get into tech?&#8221; But it feels so much more complicated with you. So I&#8217;m like, do we restructure that question? Like, what would you want that question to be? It&#8217;s kind of like, &#8220;What lessons have you learned that you would like to share with the young ones just starting out?&#8221; But&#8230; I don&#8217;t know.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, first of all, I don&#8217;t know that it should just be for the young folks because I think</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it&#8217;s really important to recognize that people might come into this at any point in their lives. We should be always be empowered to not know what we want to do in our 20s and still get to learn new jobs have dignity, autonomy, and opportunities for mastery of skills. Anyone at any age should be able to do what I do. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I did the Ascend project I was asking people to tell me about a problem they had solved. Because I think a lot of people confuse technology with liking computers. But that&#8217;s just a side note. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tech work is about solving problems. If you could tolerate getting stuck on something, bang your head against it, thinking you&#8217;re a total idiot and you&#8217;re never going to figure it out, and then managing to figure it out and get that euphoria of, &#8220;Oh my god. I did this thing. I didn&#8217;t think I could do a day, a week, a month ago.&#8221; And you get a little high from that and you&#8217;re willing to do it again, then you can do okay in technology.</span><i> </i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You could do well in a lot of different jobs. Technology is not this natural talent, a lot of the work we&#8217;re doing is not in any way rocket science. Which may or may not even be the hardest thing to do. I don&#8217;t know why that&#8217;s always the comparison. But rocket science is pretty exact. A lot of this stuff has room in it for you to bring your transferable skills from all sorts of other areas. I want to work with more people who have way different backgrounds, not just people whose lives have gone according to a plan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve had some people ask a similar sort of question at conferences, like the LGBTQ lunch that happens at Grace Hopper &#8220;What&#8217;s going to happen when school ends and I&#8217;m this genderqueer person trying to get a job?&#8221; and, &#8220;Is it going to be okay for me?&#8221; It probably will, because even though this place is full of white people with money and other privileged folks they&#8217;re all pretty nice. It&#8217;s a benign, institutionalized system of racism, sexism, heteronormativity. Whatever exists here, it&#8217;s super low-key so there&#8217;s microaggressions, guaranteed there&#8217;s microaggressions. So, you&#8217;ll survive and then it&#8217;s on people to figure out what they can tolerate and where they&#8217;re going to feel comfortable and successful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s my advice, &#8220;You&#8217;ll survive at the very minimum!&#8221; Someone&#8217;s going to find comfort in that. You know what sucks is I can&#8217;t say you will thrive. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever be able to say that to somebody who comes from any kind of underrepresented population, that they will thrive in this environment. I don&#8217;t see even the people who fit the mold thriving here. I think the current Silicon Valley model has isolated and cut off its workers from humanity and so those of us who come in knowing a little more about what’s happening outside this bubble just feel the pain more acutely.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> However we also have outside communities to retreat to in healing, I’m thankful for the contrast and I hope that others coming in will have that already or create it as needed.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;That’s my advice, &#8216;You&#8217;ll survive at the very minimum!&#8217; Someone&#8217;s going to find comfort in that.

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Okay, so why don&#8217;t we start at the beginning? Tell me a bit about where you come from and your early years and how you got here.</b></p>\n<p>Okay, I think I have a very interesting story, and I think what it all comes down to is that there is no single road into Silicon Valley. I graduated college with a degree in French Literature, and growing up I had always wanted to be an architect&#8230;</p>\n<p><b>Me, too!</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Really?</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay, awesome. My senior year of college, I got into a Master&#8217;s of Architecture program at the Art Institute of Chicago. This little, little, tiny thing inside me was like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t go straight into that program, defer a year.&#8221; I deferred a year with the intention of moving to San Francisco to save money. This is in 2006, and I don&#8217;t know why I thought the word “San Francisco” and “save money” went hand in hand, but it did for me, I guess, at the time. I had family out here, and within like the first month I realized I didn&#8217;t want to be an architect. I realized what I loved about it was theory and history as opposed to actual drafting and designing, and so I started working in PR, doing communications. Web 2.0 was a thing at that time, but it just exposed me to the whole world of communications and editorial, and so I was just like, &#8220;Well, this feels right to me.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>Fast forward, and I thought, &#8220;I want to use these skills for something good.&#8221; I was working in policy, doing criminal justice reform, accountable development, working with non-profits and public agencies as a consultant. I was doing that for a couple years, and I got really bored at my job, just because I had this background. I was a French major, I wanted architecture, so I had this creative vein in everything that I do, but my work in policy wasn&#8217;t fulfilling that.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At that same time, I was kind of deciding to go natural. I had relaxed my hair using chemical straighteners for 15 years, and I decided that I didn&#8217;t want to do that anymore. I decided that it was such a big, monumental transformation that I wanted to document it and really do a lot of education about it and share it with the world. I started a website called Natural Selection and&#8230;</span></p>\n<p><b>Such a good name, by the way.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you, I&#8217;m such an evolutionary nerd. I was really into that in college.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was like, yeah, so I&#8217;m going to double entendre that, started Natural Selection. It just continued to grow and grow and grow, and within a few, couple years, I ended up quitting policy and pursuing my blog full time, and I was an editor for a big curly hair website. I worked with a lot of brands and traveled around the world, to the Caribbean, to Europe, all over Atlanta just building this community of women going through the same thing that I was, and it was all just about our hair and going natural. It was really cool because I made all of these “hair friends”, and “curl friends.” The more that we grew our communities, the bigger the movement became, and it was a really cool moment in beauty industry history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had no intention of being in the beauty industry whatsoever, but I was. Then I ended up going to work at a different startup, because I was in San Francisco at the same time, and worked in a fashion startup, but then I got the itch to go back into beauty. Ended up getting connected with Tristan, and that was when everything really clicked. It was like, &#8220;Oh my gosh, here we are in San Francisco in tech, doing what I love the most, which is helping people of color feel comfortable and empowered with who they actually are.&#8221; A lot of it is through that surface of beauty, like the hair, the skin, et cetera. There was just this immediate synergy and shared sense of values from that perspective, and that is how I got to where I am today.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I mean, I think we have the hardest job in the world. It&#8217;s not even VCs not getting it, it&#8217;s that our target consumer is still very traumatized by a razor, because they have historically been served tools that are not designed for them.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>As you know, I have such a brand crush on your company, and I think you guys are doing the best consumer facing brand work in Silicon Valley. I would love to know more about the philosophy behind your work and how you approach it.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, for me it really resonates from my hair blogging days and sort of what you asked me at the beginning of this interview, was like, &#8220;tell the real story.&#8221; I found when I was blogging, people really feel more connected when you&#8217;re authentic. Whether it&#8217;s good, whether it&#8217;s bad, whether it&#8217;s a success, whether it&#8217;s a struggle, being able to tell those stories is what really allows people to become inspired and it&#8217;s content that really resonates with them. I think that is everything </span><a href=\"https://getbevel.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bevel</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> taps into, how to create authentic stories from a brand perspective, and there are so many stories, and so we have so many platforms and opportunities on which we can tell them.</span></p>\n<p><b>For sure. I&#8217;m curious, I touched on this with Tristan, about how VCs in Silicon Valley only really invest in problems that they can relate to, and there&#8217;s definitely a little bubble of people not understanding products that are created for people outside of their immediate experience. Despite all of these genuine stories of how your product is changing people&#8217;s lives, do you still experience skepticism outside of your company? How do you deal with that?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I mean, I think we have the hardest job in the world. It&#8217;s not even VCs not getting it, it&#8217;s that our target consumer is still very traumatized by a razor, because they have historically been served tools that are not designed for them. I&#8217;d say that, to me, is the area of understanding and education that we need to and are focusing on most. Encouraging, enabling, and educating men of color on how to shave properly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What makes me really hopeful is that was the same issue that I experienced in hair. If you had told me 10 years ago that I would be wearing my hair natural, I would have been like, &#8220;Yeah fucking right. There is no way I will ever stop straightening my hair,&#8221; but I just think that just, the power of a movement and the quality of products does so much.  I&#8217;m just very hopeful and confident that what we provide is going to be a real key.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. Absolutely. A big thing I&#8217;ve been focusing on in this project is people coming from diverse backgrounds and how that affects their work and how it makes them better at building products and designing products. How bringing more backgrounds to the table informs better product design. I&#8217;d love to hear more about how you guys have hired and how that has really contributed to the success of your company.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For me, and what we were looking for is, you just want people that can perform. What I have personally realized in my life is you don&#8217;t want people who are just going to take a job for money. I think that we have to find people with whom our values and product resonate that can also perform and, in that center of the Venn diagram, is where we&#8217;ll find that core team. We&#8217;ve been really, really good at doing that, because you can really tell, somebody&#8217;s like, &#8220;yeah, you just do this,&#8221; and they want to apply some other things just to this, like a business model. When you find that person who actually cares, who understands, I mean, who can understand the needs regardless of ethnic background, then I think that there are lots of people out there who get it, which is really cool.</span></p>\n<p><b>Absolutely. What would you say are your biggest motivators, what drives you in your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that there are just so many cool things that we can do, cool people to talk to, cool concepts to execute, but the fact remains that, as I said, we have the challenge of being able to show people a different experience and give them a high quality design and product experience. That&#8217;s what keeps me motivated every day. It always has and I think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s gotten me to this place. From my days of blogging, showing people that there&#8217;s a better way for them, just still rings very true.</span></p>\n<p><b>What do you look for in your work now versus when you started, like what do you look for in a job?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, I think it kind of is a good dovetail from what I was saying before. I have made the mistake of taking an opportunity just for money, and it sucks, and you&#8217;re just working without any passion behind what you do. Whereas now, holding true to the fact that I want to do things that matter to me and that resonate with me, I&#8217;ve been able to bring a lot more of myself to my work. I&#8217;m really lucky and fortunate that I get to do that. I know a lot of people don&#8217;t, and make money the number one motivator. I had an old boss who drew this—I&#8217;ve mentioned Venn diagrams twice now but—he drew this triple Venn diagram, and it&#8217;s like, what I&#8217;m good at, what makes me money, and what I&#8217;m passionate about. In the center is, that is where the magic happens.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Decades of trauma within our African American communities, and undoing that and showing that there is a different way. It&#8217;s just really hard to do. It&#8217;s not impossible, but it&#8217;s really hard to do. For men it&#8217;s this shaving situation. For women, it is the chemical products and thinking that people have to adhere to this Euro-centric standard. I think it&#8217;s just the hard thing to do, to show people that there is a different, better way that&#8217;s for them, and that they need to be authentic and true to themselves.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Absolutely. Let&#8217;s go high level for a second in your work. In your experience working in tech, what have been some of the really proud and exciting moments for you, and what have been some of the biggest struggles that you&#8217;ve had to overcome?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. It&#8217;s so funny, because working in “tech”, quote, unquote, is such a thing that I don&#8217;t think I would ever say. I never lead tech first. I might be with somebody who&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, I work in the fashion biz, and now I&#8217;m working in the beauty biz.&#8221; I think, for me, what really excites me is to pull together projects that really resonate and drive our businesses forward, which is really cool.</span></p>\n<p><b>Then what have been some of the biggest roadblocks or struggles that you&#8217;ve had to overcome in terms of work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decades of trauma within our African American communities, and undoing that and showing that there is a different way.

How do your friends and family feel about the work that you&#8217;ve done? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, they&#8217;re super stoked. They always get talking points because people like to say the craziest things. Now I know how to do this, I know how to control a message, because it&#8217;s my job to be able to do that. I lead the PR team at Walker, so I can say, &#8220;Okay. This is what I do, these are the products, this is the positioning statement&#8221; and they get it. They are so excited.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a while, as I was doing my blog, they were like, &#8220;okay, we don&#8217;t get it,&#8221; but now that they&#8217;ve been able to see how it&#8217;s evolved, and my friends are like, &#8220;wow, I can&#8217;t believe!&#8221; &#8220;I remember 7 years ago, when you had your blogger website, and were kind of like, &#8216;I&#8217;m going to bring back the black look with natural hair!” They&#8217;re like, &#8220;We just can&#8217;t believe that now you&#8217;re posting pictures of you and Nas on Instagram. That&#8217;s really cool.&#8221; And everybody else, I just get lots of compliments and hear that they&#8217;re so excited about it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The alumni director from my upper school just called me. I told her that we&#8217;re going to be in Minnesota for Target next week. I&#8217;m from Minnesota, and she asks, &#8220;Can I finally meet you? This is so exciting, we&#8217;ve been watching everything that you&#8217;re doing with </span><a href=\"http://www.walkerandcompany.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Walker and Company</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and it&#8217;s so inspiring to have somebody from our community doing such a cool, unique thing.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><b>Even though you don&#8217;t really consider yourself in tech, you are definitely involved in the industry. How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? What excites you about it, what frustrates you, what would you like to see change?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve been in San Francisco for almost 10 years and I&#8217;d say the thing that frustrates me most is seeing how it has shifted the greater community. That really scares me, in a way. I think that this greater region has been the most magical when there are a lot of different types of people around. For me, it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve always drawn a lot of creative inspiration from, that there are communities and people who actually care about the city that are really present in it. As those native communities have eroded, it&#8217;s really sad, and it&#8217;s really scary to see, just because a place that you love is being infused with people who don&#8217;t necessarily love it as much or for the same reason, is just hard to stomach.</span></p>\n<p><b>I feel you. I dress down when I go out of the house at all now, because I don&#8217;t want to be misconstrued for someone who is here for the wrong reasons.  It&#8217;s a really weird time.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right? I know. You just go on a dating app, and somebody&#8217;s saying, &#8220;I just moved here 2 weeks ago, woo hoo,&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, boy.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><b>My last question for you would be, based on the things that you&#8217;ve learned in your career and your time here, what advice would you give to folks from similar backgrounds who are hoping to get into this industry and just getting started?</b></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to end with the same thing I started with. There&#8217;s no “one road” into tech. Do what feels right to you, what your passion is about, and hopefully, and almost indefinitely, it will align, so don&#8217;t compromise who you actually are.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to end with the same thing I started with.

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Let&#8217;s get started. Tell me a bit about where you come from and how you think that affects how you approach your work as an entrepreneur.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m originally from Queens New York, born and raised. I was born in Jamaica, Queens, New York. It&#8217;s called 40 Projects. I lived there until I was about 6. Once I turned six I moved to Flushing, Queens, Latimer Gardens Projects. A lot of my life was school of hard knocks, in the struggle. I like to describe my story as that “rose that grew from concrete” story.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve been very fortunate and blessed, quite frankly, to have gone through that because it actually made me a lot stronger, a lot more resilient, a lot more confident in my ability to move faster out of need and necessity. That hunger comes out of nothing other than need. It&#8217;s just a part of me now.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, totally. I know this is a loaded question, but can you share some of those struggles that you faced in childhood that you had to overcome to get where you are? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well one, living in the projects is not easy. Two, I&#8217;ve had to go through the whole welfare thing among other things, right? I had the great fortune to go to boarding school for high school on full scholarship, one of the best high schools in the country. At that point I got to see really how the other half lives. Going to school with Fords and Rockefellers and that sort of thing. It was a really inspiring thing to me because I got to see number one, that I could compete similarly at the highest level and with the best of them. No matter what our upbringings were. It also showed me that I had a hell of a lot to learn.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I juxtapose my upbringing with that boarding school experience it&#8217;s kind of night and day. To be honest, I needed to have both of those experiences to become who I am.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I like to describe my story as that &#8216;rose that grew from concrete&#8217; story. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve been very fortunate and blessed, quite frankly, to have gone through that because it actually made me a lot stronger, a lot more resilient, a lot more confident in my ability to move faster out of need and necessity. That hunger comes out of nothing other than need. It&#8217;s just a part of me now.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><b>I want to quickly segue to your work now. I personally think you guys are doing the best consumer facing brand work in Silicon Valley. I am a super fan.</b></p>\n<p>Thank you. That makes me feel great.</p>\n<p><b>Tell me more about the brand that you guys have built and your philosophy behind it.</b></p>\n<p>Yeah, my philosophy about branding is I don&#8217;t like describing our brand. I&#8217;ve got a lesson I learned a couple of years ago from a marketing professor I trust from Stanford. She said &#8220;Tristan, brand is not what you say it is, it&#8217;s what they say it is.&#8221; I really articulate our brand through our customer stories. Fortunately a lot of them are consistent!</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I get emails all the time from customers that talk about the success they’re having. I got an email from a woman who said “thank you for finally helping single moms teach their sons how to shave.” Or “thank you for fighting for a product that works.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know that&#8217;s my story. A pretty important rite of passage. As a young man in the Army, you have to shave everyday. These are the stories that I need to hear, that we&#8217;re onto something special. A lot of these stories are incredibly similar. If we can tell those stories through our own kind of authentic narrative, then I think we&#8217;ve nailed something and we&#8217;ve done it, right?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m always hard-pressed to say, &#8220;Hey, here&#8217;s what our brand is right now&#8221; because it&#8217;s also so adaptive, but so far it&#8217;s been incredibly consistent and told through our own customers stories.</span></p>\n<p><b>I love it. Tell me a bit more about how you hire and how that has contributed to the success of your company.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think one thing I think a lot about is this term &#8216;culture fit&#8217;. I think it&#8217;s a silly, silly, silly, silly phrase, specifically because no one defines it. It is important to me to really define what that means to people. Before I raised a cent in money, I wrote down the six values of the company. Courage, Inspiration, Respect, Judgement, Wellness, Loyalty. They&#8217;re all defined on our website etcetera. It wasn&#8217;t enough to just put in on our website. I wanted to entrench it in every single thing that we do. If you get reviews, you are rated according to your goal attainment but also every single one of those values. Are you inspiring? Are you practicing good judgement? Are you being courageous and inspiring?</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think one thing I think a lot about is this term &#8216;culture fit&#8217;.

It is important to me to really define what that means to people.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also our interview process. We&#8217;re going to ask leading questions to get at one&#8217;s courage. We&#8217;re going to ask leading questions to get at one&#8217;s loyalty and respect. It provides an objective framework for folks who are not me to scale the hiring process in a way that&#8217;s clearly defined. I think that&#8217;s contributed quite a bit to a lot of success that we&#8217;ve had, and because </span><a href=\"https://getbevel.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bevel</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is probably one of the most diverse companies on the planet in technology especially.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, absolutely. Something that&#8217;s come up in this project is that VC&#8217;s typically invest in problems that they can personally relate to. I&#8217;m curious if you experience quite a bit of skepticism building products for people of color in tech&#8230;</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, I still do.</span></p>\n<p><b>And how do you overcome that?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I mean, I overcome it by delivering product that works, building product that people love. To this day, people still don&#8217;t think this thing is going to work which is crazy to me because it&#8217;s just so clear that there&#8217;s such a consumer demand for this. That&#8217;s fine. They can think what they want to but we&#8217;re just going to keep moving towards our true north which is just delighting our customers and making health and beauty simple. That&#8217;s it. I don&#8217;t need their validation.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. I feel you. Another huge thing in this project has been people feeling a sense of isolation not knowing anyone who was like them or came from an unusual background, something that I definitely felt when I worked in tech.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah.</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m curious about your experience early in your career coming into tech in terms of feeling isolated or not knowing anyone like you and how you feel about it now.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My whole journey here started in 2008 when I came out to go to business school. That was the first time I had even heard about Silicon Valley. I didn&#8217;t even know it was a place. I was very lucky to have an email address that had .edu at the end. It allowed me to speak to a lot of folks that I might not have gotten access to otherwise. Fortunately, they saw it as coming from a place of pure genuine interest. For me, the isolation wasn&#8217;t there insomuch as my ability to speak to folks. Primarily, it was inability to speak to folks that looked like me. There just aren&#8217;t enough people. One thing that&#8217;s important is to increase the number of folks. Some of the stuff that we&#8217;re doing at </span><a href=\"http://www.code2040.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CODE2040</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> really speaks to that because I saw there was a need. Even some of the stuff that we&#8217;re doing at </span><a href=\"http://www.walkerandcompany.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Walker &amp; Company</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I see bouts of isolation but nothing to really restrict me from chasing ambition I suppose.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;To this day, people still don&#8217;t think this thing is going to work which is crazy to me because it&#8217;s just so clear that there&#8217;s such a consumer demand for this. That&#8217;s fine. They can think what they want to but we&#8217;re just going to keep moving towards our true north which is just delighting our customers and making health and beauty simple. That&#8217;s it. I don&#8217;t need their validation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>What would you say are your biggest motivators right now? What drives you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think a lot about looking longer term. I want this to be 150 year old organization right? When I’m long gone, what&#8217;s the kind of legacy that I hope to leave? There are two things I think are incredibly important here. Number one (and this is the stuff that motivates me), I look at my son.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I want him to be treated as a first class consumer along with anyone else where his interests and needs are respected. Secondly, I want him to know and feel like he can produce at the highest level without bias.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I think about my motivational driver, it’s allowing and getting him to live in that world.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I look at my son. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I want him to be treated as a first class consumer along with anyone else where his interests and needs are respected.

I have a responsibility. I&#8217;ve been given this amazing opportunity to give back. Period. I want to make sure that I&#8217;m doing right by the folks who have actually given me the opportunity and offering other folks that might be on the come up the same opportunity. Code 2040, Walker &amp; Company, et cetera, I&#8217;m dedicating my life to this. I&#8217;m doing everything that I can to mitigate any need for that pressure. It&#8217;s less pressure and more responsibility. I have a responsibility to not only succeed but also to help others who look like me succeed. That just makes it easier for the next group of folks.</span></p>\n<p><b>You&#8217;ve come up a lot in this project in other interviews.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, very cool. Hopefully good things!</span></p>\n<p><b>Good things and kind of profound things—like someone literally said “Tristan can&#8217;t carry the torch for us forever, you know.”</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nothing will have changed if that&#8217;s the case. That&#8217;s not something that I want. I say that because there are a lot of people doing amazing things that should be celebrated. Right? I get a ton of interviews all the time and folks reach out to me to talk and I&#8217;m like “stop talking to me.” Talk to these folks that really have an interesting story to tell. There are other folks and let&#8217;s celebrate them just as we celebrate Tristan because it should be done. There are some other folks who just say that Tristan&#8217;s sucking up all the oxygen. I think a lot of people think that I do that purposely. I actually try and &#8230; I really, really try to not do any of it anymore. It&#8217;s unfair. It really is.</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re frustrated with that, you probably feel like it&#8217;s a little lazy.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exactly. </span></p>\n<p><b>I get it. I&#8217;m really sensitive about it as the founder of this project, of &#8220;No, no, no, don&#8217;t talk to me. Talk to the people in this project.&#8221;</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Totally.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been given this amazing opportunity to give back.

What frustrates you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look, I don&#8217;t think about it. I just think about being the most faithful person I can be. I care about building the most important organization I can and I care about ensuring that my family is taken care of and safe. That&#8217;s enough for me to focus on. I can&#8217;t really focus too much on the ebbs and flows of macroeconomic stuff. If it&#8217;s not for the sake of my own personal business?</span></p>\n<p><b>My last question for you before I send you off is what advice would you give to folks of similar background who are hoping to get in tech or just getting started.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, this is the same advice I give to pretty much anybody. I get it from Tyler Perry. What he said kind of fundamentally changed my life. He said “Tristan you realize your potential as an entrepreneur when you understand that the trials you go through and the blessings you receive are the exact same things.” What he meant by that was those trials you go through are just lessons. Lessons and blessings. You have to revel in that. It was the most important thing that I needed to hear because it&#8217;s actually made me a little bit more sane as a CEO. It&#8217;s given me more perspective. It allows me to focus on the right things right now. That&#8217;s something that should not only apply to business but just general life. Right?</span></p>\n<p>That, combined with my own personal faith gives me a strong arsenal in executing my plans.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Those trials you go through are just lessons.

Tell me about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I grew up in New York city in the upper west side of Manhattan, which is very diverse. My mom is black and my dad is white so I grew up in a mixed-race household and went to a very diverse public school growing up. And so, I had the quite fortunate experience of growing up surrounded by a very brilliant, multicultural set of people for pretty much my entire childhood.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you feel like that&#8217;s shaped you in your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I loved growing up in New York City. There are a lot of points of independence that I took for granted as a kid there. I mean, I was getting myself to and from school and playdates by the time I was 11. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You see everything in New York. You see wealth. You see poverty. You see the best and the worst of society. You see people from all backgrounds. You hear every language being spoken on a daily basis. It&#8217;s just such a multicultural upbringing, that I think it really shaped my view of what the world can or should look like.</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m curious to know if you had any inclinations growing up that you would end up in the tech industry. What did you think you were going to be as a kid?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I never thought I&#8217;d end up in the tech industry. As a little kid, I thought I wanted to be a pediatrician, because that was like the only job that I understood. But, I never was interested in tech until coming out to Stanford and spending time in Silicon Valley.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You see everything in New York. You see wealth. You see poverty. You see the best and the worst of society. You see people from all backgrounds. You hear every language being spoken on a daily basis. It&#8217;s just such a multicultural upbringing, that I think it really shaped my view of what the world can or should look like.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>What was the impetus for that?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I felt like I wanted to go back to school because I wanted to learn how to build a better non-profit. I was kind of just disillusioned with the disconnect between revenues and expenses of the non-profit sector. You&#8217;re always begging for money. So I decided the quickest way to figure out how to be able to do that was to go to grad school. And Stanford, of all the business schools in particular that I visited, seemed to have by far the most diverse student body in terms of professional background and professional address. It was the only place I went where I didn&#8217;t feel like a total freak for trying to do something in the non-profit sector. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was in Harvard when Zuckerberg started Facebook. There was no (the way there is I think in so many college campuses today) dialogue around entrepreneurship and tech. It was like, &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s this weird thing that we log into and you can post your photos.&#8221; It wasn&#8217;t in my vocabulary until coming to Silicon Valley.</span></p>\n<p><b>Tell me more about your time at Stanford. Obviously what you do now came out of that, but what were your first impressions of Silicon Valley and of Stanford Academia, and this whole kind of new tech world that suddenly you find yourself in?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My first impression was that I was horrified because you had to drive a car to get anywhere and I&#8217;d never lived in a place where that was a requirement! I found it very isolating at first.  I was used to being in cities where you walk around and you see the life and the industry. In New York, it&#8217;s obvious how much is going on. You walk out on any street in Silicon Valley and it looks like nothing is happening, which couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth. I became more curious as I had more exposure, but I think the main thing was that the mindset out here was so different than what I was used to. The East Coast tends to be more traditional. People here are always interested in the disruption or the next new thing. If you have an idea, the response is often, &#8221;Go for it. Try it out.&#8221;</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I sat down with Tristan for coffee. We started talking about the fact that, by year 2040, people of color will be the majority in the U.S. He&#8217;d read a book that projected the demise of the middle class as accelerated by the adoption of technology and was in a place of—if this is what&#8217;s at risk, how do we make sure that disenfranchised communities aren&#8217;t further disenfranchised by the adoption and of technology? That was what lead to the impetus for the idea—how do we make the tech sector more inclusive so that people of color—Blacks and Latinos in particular—are not kind of left further on the sidelines further oppressed as our economy rapidly transitions towards a technology-enabled, technology-driven economy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Walk me through the moment of creation of CODE2040.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The moment of creation came about almost a year after Tristan and I had left Stanford. I did a year of business school and was trying to figure out what to do over the summer, and a friend of a friend was starting a tech company and they had a product that was in soft-mode that they were interested in rolling out across college campuses. I had, in another lifetime started a program on a college campus and had this experience in getting a bunch of shoes galvanized around an idea, and they were like, &#8221;Cool. Just take that and write a roll-out plan for the products.&#8221; It felt like something I could properly figure out. So I went and joined this company for a summer internship with the roll-out plan. I ended up running the product team, which included kind of a segment of the company. But because my background was not in product development when I took over the work, I took an approach of systems and process design that would allow for maximal creative input and use of data. That led me to work very closely with the engineering team, the QA team, the design team. I got a real appreciation of those skillsets. There is a lot of understanding that I did there as well, about engineers’ needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I transitioned myself out of the organization because having a non-technical person running product for a developer facing product did not make sense. I was coming out of that when </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I sat down with Tristan for coffee. We started talking about the fact that, by year 2040, people of color will be the majority in the U.S. He&#8217;d read a book that projected the demise of the middle class as accelerated by the adoption of technology and was in a place of—if this is what&#8217;s at risk, how do we make sure that disenfranchised communities aren&#8217;t further disenfranchised by the adoption and of technology?

I think that it&#8217;s been really exciting to see how individuals have been catalyzed by their time with us. They&#8217;re so talented, but a lot of them don&#8217;t have the access to the breadth of opportunities that could really launch them into being leaders in the field. But I think one of the most gratifying pieces of what we do has been working with the tech companies. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s certainly not true across the board, but there are companies out there who feel like they don&#8217;t know how to do diversity right. To be a place where those companies can go and have that conversation and get resources, that starts initiate systems change.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I think the third piece is probably the hardest to quantify or measure, but is about amplifying others. People on Twitter reach out and are say, &#8220;I just want you to know that I am so happy that you are doing this work because I feel less alone.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><b>What have been some of the biggest roadblocks and struggles as an entrepreneur and in building this product?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s been really hard for me to wrap my head around actually being the CEO and what that means in terms of terms of how I act and how people view me. I prefer to empower people around me. To take on as much responsibility as is humanly possible, and probably more than is healthy sometimes. I believe very strongly in distributed responsibility. I believe in a hierarchy, but you push decision making down the chain as much as possible. It&#8217;s really hard for me to remember that people really look to me for a specific level of authority and that my title conveys something, rightly or wrongly about who I am and the level of importance that I hold. I think that has been my struggle that has led me to be really slow to make certain choices or improvements in ways that I think has then made my own job harder.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly not true across the board, but there are companies out there who feel like they don&#8217;t know how to do diversity right.

Initially the big question was, &#8220;How do we get companies to believe that there is black female talent out there, that is ‘qualified’?” I would say our first inflection point was two years in when enough companies had had terrific experiences with us, that it switched to entirely inbound companies who want to work with us and hire our students. We ended up throttling our growth. That&#8217;s just really hard, period. I don&#8217;t know anybody who can solve that well-—anybody who has made that extremely efficient. I&#8217;d say for the next two years, that was a real throttle for us. How do we solve those operational expansions? We&#8217;re 18 people on staff now but we could have twice as many people and that would be super helpful. But that&#8217;s twice as expensive. Now, it&#8217;s a matter of how do we create a growth plan that&#8217;s really thoughtful and then funded in a way that&#8217;s really thoughtful. Now, it’s the question of how and when do we invest for growth. That&#8217;s the hardest challenge that we&#8217;re facing right now—how do we get the right resources someplace and deploy them as efficiently as possible.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Black and Latina/o students often say, &#8216;Why would I want to go to an industry where I can never advance, and nobody&#8217;s going to value me and I&#8217;m going to feel like an outsider?'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>In watching your fellows move through the industry, what have you all learned through your experience about the cultural and behavioral patterns in tech around people of color?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot. We&#8217;ve seen a real and really beneficial shift in the narrative over the last four years. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we started CODE2040, the dominant narrative at the time was that tech is meritocracy. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there aren&#8217;t people of color in the industry, that&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t deserve to be there. We managed to move to a place where people were willing to question that assumption, but still felt like, &#8220;Well, yeah, maybe they deserve to be there, but we can&#8217;t find them. They don&#8217;t exist.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think people are still trying to figure out what is that other thing that is happening.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A piece of it that we know from working with 75 tech companies and close to 200 students in the fall&#8217;s program alone, is that there is a culture component. It is a combination of a retention issue, and people who opt out. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black and Latina/o students often say, &#8220;Why would I want to go to an industry where I can never advance, and nobody&#8217;s going to value me and I&#8217;m going to feel like an outsider?&#8221; </span></p>\n<p>I think there&#8217;s also a growing dialogue now about this false idea of the “hiring bar.” There just is no objective set of standards around hiring. I think what we certainly believe is that there is actually is no good measurement right now. We need to get better at that.</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;When we started CODE2040, the dominant narrative at the time was that tech is meritocracy.

They don&#8217;t exist.'&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><b>What have been your biggest motivators in your work? What at the core drives you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve always, since I was a kid, had a really strong sense of fairness and justice. It&#8217;s not about who&#8217;s inherently good, bad, right or wrong, but there&#8217;s all these unseen threads that influence how we each act and achieve and show up on a day to day basis. I think that CODE2040 has obviously a strong direct service component. We work directly with students, we&#8217;re not an advocacy organization, but we do all that in service of being able to create larger systems change.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you think your background impacts the way you approach your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Essentially, CODE2040 is this giant code switch for people on both sides. Like how, if you&#8217;re a person of color, you had a certain set of life experiences. How do you show up in a room that looks like a tech company? And if you are a tech company, how do you show up in a way that lets people who just don&#8217;t approach the world the way you approach the world be included and comfortable?</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I was in enough diverse rooms growing up that I knew it was possible and that it didn&#8217;t have to be weird and uncomfortable. It could be super normal. This whole idea of  discomfort with diversity just never crossed my mind.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Essentially, CODE2040 is this giant code switch for people on both sides.

What excites you? What frustrates you? What would you like to see change?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a lot of ways I&#8217;m way more optimistic than I was a few years back. I think tech has always been good at iterating and learning and failing forward and all of that. It&#8217;s historically been relegated to products and not people and I think we&#8217;re starting to see that ethos move into the people&#8217;s space as well. But there&#8217;s also a big question mark in my mind around—as tech becomes more pervasive across industries and across the country, now what? What does it look like when there&#8217;s a thriving tech sector in Austin? In Durham? All these places that have wildly different backgrounds and backdrops than California, both economically, culturally, ethnically, in terms of industry. I think tech in the future is going to look wildly different than it does today and I don&#8217;t know what it will look like.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you think tech can do a better job accommodating people of color right now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we need to get serious about doing better on hiring. Treating that as a real competency where people are trained and there&#8217;s more structure around it. It&#8217;s like way too loose right now. So many companies have the intention to be more diverse but don&#8217;t actually have the actions to back it up. Tech undervalues HR. </span></p>\n<p>The other piece is recognizing how important culture is and that it&#8217;s really hard to change. You have to seed it at the beginning but it&#8217;s possible to change it if it&#8217;s important to you.</p>\n<p><b>What advice would you give to young folks, people of color, who really like tech and want to get into it?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find your “tribe.” I find my most effective mentors are my peers, people who have different strengths and skill sets but also people who just have my back and who I can admit my failures to.

I’m a bit of a black sheep in my family, politically and otherwise. I come from a very practical family of doctors and lawyers and bankers, and I was this artist and the performer. Nobody knew what I was going to end up doing including myself. </span></p>\n<p><b>Interesting.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was young, I changed my mind every other day about what I was going to do, what I was going to be when I grew up. I probably stressed my parents out because they are very practically-minded. When it comes to language, they said, “Take Spanish!”, and I said, “I’m going to take French!” </span>For a while, I majored in Art History, and my Dad recently admitted to me that he thought, “Oh my God, she’s never going to get a job.”<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> To his credit, he never said anything at the time.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;For a while, I majored in Art History, and my Dad recently admitted to me that he thought, “Oh my God, she’s never going to get a job.”&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>I eventually majored in theater. It’s actually some of the most useful training that I did. You acquire an extraordinary set of skills in creating live theater. It’s highly collaborative, you have to work under stressful conditions, find ways around all kinds of constraints. It also develops your ability to empathize with other people and their stories, which is an essential skill for good design.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I definitely enjoyed the humanities and art, but I also had some interest in technology and science early on. Mostly as it related to how we can help people communicate or how can we use these tools to help people do things better and improve people’s lives. Always in an extremely applied way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My graduate program really aligned with that kind of thinking. I was initially planning to apply to the NYU film school, but when I got the catalog, they had this program in it called the Interactive Telecommunications Program. The title sounds a bit dry, but the it ended up being a life changing experience for me. This was in 1994-95 when the web was really coming into its own, a time of really interesting experimentation. The program tries to meet at the crossroads of arts, technology, and people. It’s in NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts, so it’s kind of like a Media Lab run by poets. It’s really a remarkable place. Its student body was a mix of teachers, film-makers, policy makers, writers, journalist, artist and graphic designers. It continues to be an incredible advisory the experimentation. That’s where </span>I taught myself how to build websites, then found myself in a startup, and a few acquisitions and 3 babies later, ended up moving to California to work for Google, then Youtube, and now at Facebook.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I taught myself how to build websites, then found myself in a startup, and a few acquisitions and 3 babies later, ended up moving to California to work for Google, then Youtube, and now at Facebook.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>What was it like moving to Silicon Valley? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I should say I was born in Manhattan and then I grew up for chunks of time in New Jersey, Wisconsin, and Tennessee. So we moved around a lot, but all on the east coast. I never lived west of the Mississippi. I went to college in Boston, then studied art in France where I met my Canadian husband. I attended ITP in New York City, and then we got married we moved to Williamstown, Massachusetts in the Berkshire mountains where I was at a startup called Tripod. Then we moved to Boston when Tripod was acquired by Lycos. At that point, I was pregnant with my second baby, and the industry was in the doldrums. I decided to stay home for a while and we moved to North Carolina to be closer to family and live on a leaner budget. You see, at that point I had had three kids in four years and so was home full time for about four years in the middle of all of my different jobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then I went back to work when my youngest was two. I joined the design team at Wachovia of all places, may it rest in peace. It was a great company to work for and a great re-entry for me after four years of being checked out and up to my eyeballs in diapers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had established a lot of strong relationships with designers at Wired Digital which also got acquired by Lycos. People like Jeff Veen and Doug Bowman. Extraordinary designers who also happened to be good people. They had gone to work for Google and next thing I knew, so was I, dragging my husband and kids with me. </span></p>\n<p>I remember when I got the offer from Google, it was a big deal to move the family. We had a nice house. The kids were in good schools. I was close to my parents. I was agonizing over it, because I was asking my husband to quit a job he loved, which is not easy, and to move three kids. And he said, “When you get asked to pitch for the Yankees you don’t stay on the minor leagues. You must go and do this.”<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And that was about eight years ago. So I don’t know. I feel like it’s been an extraordinary experience because </span>the concentration of talented, passionate people is so insanely high here. Just the level of competency and ingenuity and energy that people bring towards things is really special. And I think if I were ever to move to live some place else, I know that I would miss that.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I remember when I got the offer from Google, it was a big deal to move the family.

When we go back to the Berkshires in Western Massachusetts to visit friends, they don’t ask that much about Facebook, or technology, or start ups to invest in. They want to talk about art, music, go for a hike, visit a farm. I miss that sometimes.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Silicon Valley is like DC and LA. They are one industry towns, and so all of your friends are your colleagues and all of your colleagues are your friends, and even if you want to not think about work, it’s almost impossible not to. It can also be a pretty isolating place to live if you aren’t in the tech industry. </span>There’s so much value put on tech that it almost feels that if you’re not doing that, you must not be doing something worthwhile, and that’s a shame.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So it’s a remarkable place to work. I have absolutely no regrets about being here, and I feel lucky every day to work at Facebook, a company with leaders and that I admire and respect and a mission I really believe in. AND it would be nice to have a little more balance sometimes.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;When I visit other places that aren’t as work-focused, I am reminded that most people don’t live their lives this way, and that there’s a certain level of sanity associated with not having everything revolve around your work.

So I feel like I need to tread carefully on saying, “My life experiences have helped me design for the entirety of humanity.” It’s a big challenge for companies like the ones that I’ve worked at to try to—with all good intentions—design for the scope and the diversity of the human population when we are so un-diverse as a workforce. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, there are a few things about the way I grew up that shape my perspective. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like growing up in a very large family with a lot of personalities helps me to be adaptive and collaborative in a way that served me professionally. I can get along with most people. </span>I’m just naturally inclined to figure out compromises and facilitate conversations, because that’s what you do when you have eight siblings.<em> It’s just a basic survival tactic. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working in teams of people from different backgrounds and disciplines, these kinds of interpersonal skills are not something I take for granted, and I think I have my family to thank for a lot of that.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Listen, I’m a well-off white person. So I feel like I need to tread carefully on saying, “My life experiences have helped me design for the entirety of humanity.” It’s a big challenge for companies like the ones that I’ve worked at to try to—with all good intentions—design for the scope and the diversity of the human population when we are so un-diverse as a workforce.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also really cherish my humanities and liberal arts education because I feel like it’s made me more curious and empathetic towards people with different experiences than me. I really appreciate the push towards getting more people, especially women and underrepresented minorities, into science and engineering. At the same time, </span>I worry a bit that we are forgetting how important the humanities are to rounding out your education. Subjects like philosophy, anthropology, and psychology teach us about humans and their needs and desires. Without that training, I fear we’ll know how to build things but we may not have the compass to understand what to build and why. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that compass comes in large part through the humanities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And obviously my training at ITP. The founder, Red Burns, was an important mentor to me. She really influenced my perspective and my philosophy on things. I don’t think I realized just how much until she passed away a few years ago. She was a total firecracker of a woman. She wasn’t that interested in the question, “What can we do with technology,” but instead asked us, “What can technology do for people?” Really putting technology in in service of people and not enslaving people to it. That’s something I really feel really passionately about. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And finally, I think that the people that you surround yourself with ultimately are the biggest influencers. My husband is a really wonderful person. Just by virtue of him, being from Canada and growing up in Quebec and just having a lot of different perspectives on things, I feel like he’s influenced my learning and development a lot over the years too. We’re celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary this year, so I’m thinking a lot about that right now. Obviously I was 12 when I got married [chuckles].</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I worry a bit that we are forgetting how important the humanities are to rounding out your education.

What activates you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Something that always energies and inspires me is when I get to observe or experience the way other people live and and how those life experiences might cause them to see or value the products I build differently than I do. Years ago at Wachovia, we did a lot of research into how we could better support customers with severe visual impairments; this work was way ahead of its time. For most of us, online banking is a convenience, so we don’t have to go to the physical bank branch. But the people we met through that study couldn’t drive to a branch to take care of it themselves. For those who are blind or have seriously impaired vision, online banking is the difference between having financial independence and having to rely on someone else to do your banking for you. And the independence was crucially important to their well-being on so many levels. That made me realize something I’ve observed many times since…these technologies can mean very different things to different people depending on their context. </span></p>\n<p>Most people look at Google search and think, “It’s so convenient to be able to look up whatever you want.” But, if you live in a place that doesn’t have libraries, Google in the difference between being able to educate yourself versus not. Or YouTube. Some people think of it as a place with entertaining videos, but if you live in a place that doesn’t have freedom of speech, it’s the difference between knowing what’s going on through citizen reporting or not.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I get really excited when we launch something and then get to see what people do with the things we make. </span>When you are designing for a huge global audience, you can have a sense of what problem you are solving and try to design it in ways that will work for most people. But invariably, people will take that thing and apply it to things you never thought of. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good example is how Facebook Safety check came to being. Facebook wasn’t created as a crisis communications system, but with so many people connected on the platform, it was the natural and logical place for people to let their friends and family know they are Ok in the wake of a natural disaster or even a terrorist attack. So a team at Facebook observed this and designed not just for people but with people. </span>I find that idea of co-designing with humanity to be really inspiring and exciting.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;When you are designing for a huge global audience, you can have a sense of what problem you are solving and try to design it in ways that will work for most people.

I know that sounds like a platitude. But I have to feel like the thing I’m working on intends to lift people up, in a very broad and democratizing way. I love breaking down the hierarchy. Whether it’s media hierarchy, or communication hierarchy, or whatever it is. I like the fact that a blind person wouldn’t have to rely on somebody to drive them to the bank. Or that a singer songwriter would be able to support themselves through YouTube videos instead of having to sign with a record label. Or that people could raise money for a cause they care about and actually move the needle on medical research like the ALS folks did on Facebook through the Ice Bucket Challenge. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes people look at what I’m working on now—digital advertising tools—and think, “Wow, you’ve gone 180 from there!” But I don’t see it that way at all. Ultimately what I’m working on now is about economic development and job creation. I think sometimes we look at the world’s problems—poverty, inequality, you name it—in very surface level ways, and what I’ve really enjoyed over past four years of working on the business side of Facebook is becoming smarter about how the world works, how society works, how the economy works and understanding that if you can help people provide for themselves, you have less war, you have less poverty, you have less terrorism, even.  </span></p>\n<p>I definitely have a bit of an activist in me. I hate injustice and I hate unfairness and so I think I’ve been on this, I don’t know, 20 year voyage just trying to figure out how can design be a part of the solution. Because I feel like design is still only being applied to a very small percentage of the problems that it can solve. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s what I’m doing more recently in my writing; just trying to encourage more designers to look past the obvious flashy thing they can be working on and think, “What could I change if I applied myself to software for the government,” or “How can design get involved in making the criminal justice more equitable and humane?” These are all design problems. They may be less sexy, behind the scenes. It’s not necessarily going to get you a big splashy article in the technology magazine, but who cares?</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I definitely have a bit of an activist in me.

As a leader, one of the most important skills is to be able to craft a narrative, a vision for what you want your team to aspire to, that captures their imagination. So in some form or another, I’ve been writing and storytelling my whole career, though I didn’t as publish my writing as much until more recently. The big driver of that was fairly practical.  We faced a big challenge a few years back attracting people to work on the business side of Facebook. It wasn’t visible to people. They knew the consumer-facing Facebook products, and that’s what most people coming in wanted to work on. I get that. And if it was visible to them, many were like, “Mmm, I don’t really want to work on ads.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making the work visible to people, helping them understand the impact, both on Facebook as a business and on society as a whole, how we can help improve the experience that people have at work day to day, as well as grow economies and create jobs…those were the big things that I focused on in terms of writing. About business design, and the way designers can have impact on a whole host of important issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Occasionally I’ll just get mad about something and write about it. A few months ago, I published an article about my uterus [chuckles]. I don’t know if you saw that.</span></p>\n<p><b>Oh yeah [laughter]. We’re going to get to that in a minute.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have 100 ideas of things that I’d like to write about. It frustrating to me that I haven’t succeeded in more consistently making time for it because I feel like it’s something that I’m good at, it’s something that I enjoy, and I feel a connection to people when I do it. But it’s always about capturing the time. You know how that is. I’m sure that’s how you feel about photography and other things.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was so frustrated and fed up on behalf of women in this industry who are trying to position themselves as equals and sometimes deserving to be seen as superior to some men in the industry, and just constantly having to pay this tax that men don’t have to pay around having talking about their personal lives. Or having it being positioned as, &#8216;Wow, you did all this in spite of being a mother!&#8217; It’s just constantly minimizing their professional contributions. I don’t have any problem with anyone talking about their families and their role as a parent. But it should be on their terms, and they should never feel obligated to do it, in a context where they were asked to talk about their professional accomplishments. That’s my beef. And if you are going to ask those kinds of questions like, &#8216;How do you do it all?&#8217;, then ask the men too.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Yeah, this project will very much be a snapshot of tech culture in 2016.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m a maker. I got into management a long time ago and realized that in the corporate context, the biggest value that I could provide is that I’m really good at building teams. So I had to let go of a lot of the hands-on contribution in the interest of making space for other people to do it. But I still have the urge, the urge to produce things, to find an outlet for that, to connect with what other people that are making and to be inspired by that. So I find different ways—you know, we have the Facebook Analog Research Lab where we print beautiful posters. I love just seeing what they’re making, and I get so excited about communication design that’s going on at Facebook. I think it’s really magical. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then personally I do all kinds of things. I knit a lot, and I like to draw, and so writing &#8211; in addition to doing it because I think it’s really helpful to my work &#8211; is just a creative outlet for me. I never thought of myself as a writer until more recently, which is kind of interesting. I’ve always thought  of myself as a visual person or a performer, but I’ve surprised myself with how much gratification I get from writing. </span></p>\n<p><b>Let’s talk about your uterus [laughter].</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everybody else is, why not? When I published that piece, I said to my husband something like, “At some point, I will regret making my uterus a topic of public conversation. I don’t know when it’s going to happen, but…”</span></p>\n<p><b>You’ve written about the bias that you’ve seen on stage or at conferences. You also touched on, as you got older, you became more cognizant of bias in tech in general. Can you expand on that?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. It’s interesting, often I’ll take weeks, even months to write a complex piece about design. But with the piece about women in tech, I wrote the bulk of that in about 45 minutes at a Starbucks. </span>I was so frustrated and fed up on behalf of women in this industry who are trying to position themselves as equals and sometimes deserving to be seen as superior to some men in the industry, and just constantly having to pay this tax that men don’t have to pay around having talking about their personal lives. Or having it being positioned as, “Wow, you did all this in spite of being a mother!” It’s just constantly minimizing their professional contributions.</p>\n<p>I don’t have any problem with anyone talking about their families and their role as a parent. But it should be on their terms, and they should never feel obligated to do it, in a context where they were asked to talk about their professional accomplishments. That’s my beef. And if you are going to ask those kinds of questions like, “How do you do it all?”, then ask the men too.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I published the article on Medium, I wasn’t surprised to hear from a lot of women who said it really resonated with them.  But it was really interesting to hear from many men, too, who were like, “You know what? I’m really pissed because I realized nobody ever asks me about my family. I think it’s because they think I don’t care as much about my family as my wife does.” The whole thing is dehumanizing to everyone. It’s like, “Women, all you are is a group of people who help make families, and then also could work. Men, you are people who work, and maybe you have a family.” It’s all based on really unfortunate stereotypes and doesn’t allow people to define themselves and how they want to be seen. </span></p>\n<p><b>I also noticed in your writing that you gave people books for Christmas and I did the same thing.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh really?</span></p>\n<p><b>Yes. I gave all my best friends like 10 books that affected me deeply in 2015, because last year was a year of reading self-help books and being a hermit. You also mentioned that you’re not like a huge books person. What was it about those books that impacted you so much?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, it’s interesting. I’ll tell you something that hardly anybody knows because I’m still processing it myself. I just got diagnosed with dyslexia a month ago [chuckles].</span></p>\n<p><b>For real?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[laughter] My daughter has dyslexia, and when we were going through the process of getting her assessed they interviewed me and my husband. And after they interviewed me they were like, ‘’You probably have some undiagnosed issues.’’ I’ve always been a very slow reader, and I struggle to keep up with a lot of written information. I reverse things all the time and have a terrible sense of direction. There are a lot of things that in hindsight make a lot more sense. And so when they said that to me I was like, ‘’Hmm, that’s interesting.’’ I thought, ‘’I think I’m just going to get assessed, too, just to find out.’’ So I went through a formal assessment with the clinical psychologist, and boom, here I am.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s kind of a wild thing to find this out a lot later than kids like my daughter discovered it. But I think you’re much better off finding that out today then when I was a kid. I don’t think people really understood it then. I think they may have thought that it was correlated with intelligence, which it isn’t at all. Maybe you get put in special ed when you didn’t need to, you just needed time accommodation. You know what I mean? I just think there’s a lot less stigma attached to it today. I see my daughter going through that. She’s like, “Yeah, it’s fine. I’m not embarrassed about it. I have a bunch of friends who are dyslexic [chuckles].” It’s like no big deal.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you survey successful, CEOs, there’s a disproportionate percentage of them that have dyslexia, or some kind of learning challenge. This makes sense because for those people, everything’s harder. They’re just naturally inclined to be tenacious and have grit, and to work through problems, and to recover from failure, because that’s how it is when you are a dyslexic in a world awash with written information. That whole notion of going beyond what you were born with is really appealing to me. It’s such an optimistic way of looking at human opportunity.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m still processing what that means for me. But generally, I’m excited because I’m just a big believer in self-awareness and self-knowledge. If that’s true of my brain, I want to know it so that I can figure out how can I work more effectively. Just the recognition that I’m probably working X percent harder than I need to, and maybe there’s technology and tools that can help me have to work less hard at things is hopeful and liberating. </span>I think I’ve believed in some contexts that I wasn’t as smart as the people around me, but the reality is that the mechanics of my brain were just slowing me down. I think we should all be interested in understanding how our minds work and how we can harness technology to work better<em>. </em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the psychologist asked me, “Margaret, what’s your relationship to reading?” I said, “I love stories.” She’s like, “That’s not the same thing. How do you feel about reading?” I said, “I love audiobooks.” I asked my mother one time what I used to do when I was a kid and she said, “You spent hours in your room, listening to those books that had the records that went along with them.” So interesting. Kids are amazing. They just figure out sometimes what they need even if adult don’t recognize that there’s an issue. Because one of the classic recommendation for people with dyslexia is to listen to audio versions while you’re reading the same written material. I guess I figure that out when I was three.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, I have hundreds and hundreds of books. I love stories and narrative so much, and yet reading a book just really takes me forever. If it’s not unbelievably engaging, I just don’t get through it. Which is frustrating because I’m an incredibly curious person and there’s 1,001 things I want to learn about. But I’ve found other ways to learn and grow. I don’t need to feel bad about it anymore. The reason this relates to the piece that I wrote about growth and vulnerability is two-fold; and this is so interesting in hindsight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One is that Carol Dweck talks a lot about people with learning challenges in her book Mindset, because</span> if you survey successful, CEOs, there’s a disproportionate percentage of them that have dyslexia, or some kind of learning challenge. This makes sense because for those people, everything’s harder. They’re just naturally inclined to be tenacious and have grit, and to work through problems, and to recover from failure, because that’s how it is when you are a dyslexic in a world awash with written information. That whole notion of going beyond what you were born with is really appealing to me. It’s such an optimistic way of looking at human opportunity.</p>\n<p>The hardest thing sometimes is for people to get over their fear of failure, whether it’s professionally or personally. They pull punches all the time. They don’t take the risk, because they’re afraid of failing, and they miss all of the learning comes from failure.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Mindset is a book that’s really been influential to me as a person, as a manager and a colleague, and as a parent, quite frankly. I really try to drive this into my kids, like, “Do your best and don’t worry about failing. I don’t actually care what classes you take, or what you study. But, don’t shy away from something because it’s hard. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then, Brene Brown — who doesn’t love Brene Brown. </span></p>\n<p><b>That was one of the books I gave to my friends this year.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you listened to any of her audio books? Her voice, her accent is just amazing. And she is so funny. But I think that book has been really influential for me, and just her teachings in general. And by the way, not coincidentally, both of those I listened as audio books. I never read the physical book [chuckle].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funny, I think one of the things that I realized about myself, and I don’t know why this is, is that I am in a lot of ways unconcerned with admitting to my weaknesses. Sometimes it perplexes me about why people are afraid to do that. </span>It’s absurd to think that we are all great at everything. Like its just an absurd notion, and I always tend to feel like if you own your bad PR, nobody can say anything about you that you haven’t already said about yourself. It’s very liberating.</p>\n<p><b>What advice would you give to kind of young puppies starting out that you wish that you’d known in the beginning?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take risks, especially when you’re young. You can fall down, but you won’t fall down that far because you’re already close to the ground.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[laughter]</span></p>\n<p>It always makes me sad when people in early career play it too safe.

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b></b><b>So, tell me about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I grew up in San Jose, California. My family was middle-class. My father was a software engineer, my mother taught school. It was a very conservative household, or at least California conservative. That really textured my world view.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People ask me now, how that affected me being trans, and it&#8217;s… well, the thing that you are is such an anathema to the culture you&#8217;re brought up in. It&#8217;s problematic. I think the biggest impact was that </span>I lacked any real sense of self. I was just trying to be what everybody around me wanted.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teachers loved me, because I was always doing what they wanted, and I was way more concerned with the adults in my life than my peers. I always did what my parents, particularly my mom, expected. I was always filling particular roles. That really drove a lot of my life in terms of what I did. It wasn&#8217;t until decades later, post-transition, where I start to develop a real sense of self. And then I&#8217;m think, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s weird—how did I live so much of my life having no real sense of who I was, just trying to be what everybody around me wanted?”</span></p>\n<p><b>Were you exposed to creativity or technology, or any of those concepts early on?</b></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s an awesome thing about the household I grew up in. My dad worked in the software industry. We had computers and game systems in the house my entire life. That was always something we had. We had a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128\" target=\"_blank\">Commodore 128</a>. It has the basic interpreter on there. You could write little go-to loop-type things. Actually it was my friend&#8217;s dad who had the first computer I ever saw. I was—I want to say—three and a half, maybe four years old, and I&#8217;m over at my friend&#8217;s house and he&#8217;s got this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II\" target=\"_blank\">Apple II</a>. It has this green screen. My friend’s dad shows us this vector drawing of a frying pan. You can&#8217;t even see it on one screen all at once. You have to scroll or zoom out. I see this and then he shows this little game he wrote of where these little horses race across the screen. Seeing that was the moment where I was thought, &#8220;This is the most amazing things I&#8217;ve ever seen.&#8221; That moment still stands out in my head when people ask me, &#8220;How did you get into technology?&#8221; That moment was really defining.</p>\n<p><b>Walk me from that moment to working in tech. How did you get into it? What has your career experience been like?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I first started college I wanted to do something a bit different. I wanted do music for video games. I was strongly pushed by my mother to go into computer science. &#8220;You can make all this money doing software.&#8221; And so I went into it. It was an interesting thing—I was good at it and I did enjoy it. I think I still regret not following my heart at the time. I pursued a computer science degree, and then started working in the software industry. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve done since. It&#8217;s an interesting field. There are times when I love it, and there are times when I hate it.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was presenting very gender-queer in interviews. And not getting any offers. Finally, one day, I gave up. I went to an interview without nail polish, no lip gloss. I presented as male as possible. Lo and behold: I got an offer. The thing of it is every time I&#8217;ve been brought in for an on site interview, where I was presenting male, I received an offer.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>What are some of the highlights, and proudest moments, and things that have excited you the most about your time in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s a great question. I was really proud of my work at <a href=\"http://www.onemedical.com/bridge/\" target=\"_blank\">One Medical</a>. Before I left there, I took a few minutes and ran a query on the git repository. I wondered, “How much of this code base did I write?” It turned out to be around 40%. During the time I was there, the software team was on average of about five people. Sometimes less, sometimes a little bit more but I was the first developer they hired. Writing that much code could potentially be embarrassing, except that I&#8217;m very particular about not writing verbose or excessive code. I write what I need.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m really proud of what I did there. I&#8217;m proud of the type of work that we did and the direction we were going. That was a really neat part of my career.</span></p>\n<p><b>Your work has certainly impacted me as a One Medical member.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I look at it, and it&#8217;s this was a really big thing that I poured a huge part of my life into, and I look at a lot of other things I&#8217;m really proud of, and I feel like none of them quite stand on that same tier. I think I wrote some beautiful code when I was doing device drivers, some really elegant things. I solved some really hard problems, but they just don&#8217;t stand up in terms of the long term term impact that they have. One thing exciting about my current role is that it has the same potential for long term impact. We are building tools to fight harassment. To me, that is just as big as doing medical software.</span></p>\n<p><b>Tell me more about that.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being harassed online sucks. And I&#8217;m working for the biggest player in open source community platforms: <a href=\"https://github.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Github</a>. They made a decision at a very high level to put money and people behind actually making Github a platform that is safe and inclusive. I&#8217;m building up a team; we&#8217;ve got a really good foundation in the works. It&#8217;s going to be a while until we have real tangible results, and it&#8217;s not an easy area. There are a lot of really tricky aspects to it. But those are challenges that I&#8217;m excited to rise to. </span>I want to build the online space that I want to have for myself.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I want to build an online space that sets the tone for the future. I don&#8217;t want just to make this platform good.

A place where voices are not suppressed and that people feel safe.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>On the flipside, what have some of your biggest struggles been in your career?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest struggle was post-transition, or probably mid-transition, when I was trying to figure things out and just living in a sort of gender-queer life, and I needed to find a different job. I was determined that I didn’t want to work any place that won&#8217;t accept me as I am. So </span>I was presenting very gender-queer in interviews. And not getting any offers. Finally, one day, I gave up. I went to an interview without nail polish, no lip gloss. I presented as male as possible. Lo and behold: I got an offer. The thing of it is every time I&#8217;ve been brought in for an on site interview, where I was presenting male, I received an offer.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I got that job. I worked there for a couple of years, and then there were some really negative situations there, however I did manage to transition during that time. That company ended up being a mixed bag. I had some solid support from my peers, but I could&#8217;ve had a lot better support from management. I realized, at some point, that the professional relationship had become fairly dysfunctional.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I needed to move on. I started interviewing for other positions. At this point, I was presenting female. It&#8217;s a lot different interviewing for a tech job when presenting female.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bad interviews were not a big deal. If my skill set and approach don’t line up with a company, I expect them to pass. But the good ones… the good ones kept resulting in rejection. When a company decides to keep moving forward, especially when it&#8217;s been multiple rounds, it&#8217;s clear that they think you are suited for the job. They are spending time and money to pursue you. These companies would get to the end of all of this and then decline me on the grounds of something we discussed as a non-issue in the very early rounds of screening. For example, &#8220;We think we want somebody with more such and such experience.&#8221; and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Wait, we talked about that exact thing during the first phone screen!” Why would you put hours of your employees&#8217; time and mine into this interview process if that thing was an issue?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s clear there is a bias at work. A lot of men don&#8217;t want to work for or with a woman. On top of that, I never know who might have read me as trans and had their own transphobia come into play. But</span> it&#8217;s pretty easy to sabotage somebody in the interview process if you want to. And I&#8217;m sure anyone with a non-privileged background faces these exact same type of things where all it takes is, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re a good fit,&#8221; or, &#8220;Nah, they made me kind of uncomfortable,&#8221; or, &#8220;I really didn&#8217;t like the way they answered this one thing.&#8221; It&#8217;s much easier to sabotage somebody than it is to champion for them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty easy to sabotage somebody in the interview process if you want to.

You worked in tech for 15 years before you transitioned. So you have tons of experience in the industry. How is life before and after?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a much different understanding of privilege. There&#8217;s a difference between knowledge and understanding. And to fully grasp the level of privilege I was afforded, it took this very painful experience of having to job search for over a year, and a lot of great interviews that my previous experience said, oh yeah, you have an interview like that you&#8217;re going to get a nice offer, you&#8217;re going to have multiple offers coming in. You&#8217;ll be in this great competitive situation!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead I would find that even when things went really well, when I was expecting to receive an offer. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to work at some of these places. I would have been the first woman engineer. Do I really want to be that person? I&#8217;ve got a thick skin. I can handle it. I&#8217;ll do it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then they make the decision for me. They decide I am not up to the challenge of being the first woman. They can’t legally turn you away for that. But they can always come up with some other reason. </span></p>\n<p>These situations brought me to very deep understanding of privilege. It is a much more nuanced and deep and personal thing than I understood before that.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had to learn a lot about this privilege thing, and how much I had, and how much I&#8217;ve lost.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a huge difference between the male friend who knows, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s not safe for you to walk down this street at night,&#8221; They will walk you to your car, all that stuff. They know about that and they do the right thing. But it’s a very different experience when you feel mortal terror. When you have to that walk by yourself, and you have some guy on a bicycle circling up, and coming up towards you, and approaching you, and&#8211; There&#8217;s a very different feeling and if you don&#8217;t have that experience, you&#8217;ll never fully understand. You will know. But you won’t understand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s a much scarier place than just not being able to get a job. </span>I&#8217;ve had to learn a lot about this privilege thing, and how much I had, and how much I&#8217;ve lost.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of this has impacted me in a professional capacity. I am a huge champion of mitigating and eliminating bias in hiring. We have to really work hard to do this. Fortunately, we have good economic data on why you should do this. Ultimately companies should do this because it&#8217;s ethical, but sometimes you can&#8217;t always win over a board with the ethical argument. But you can at least win them over with the profit argument. </span></p>\n<p>My experiences have made me a big advocate and champion for how to we empirically cut biases out of these processes, how do we give more opportunities to people from underprivileged backgrounds, how do we make tech a more equitable place? It already has huge economic barriers to entry, for instance, if you can&#8217;t afford to have a computer in your house. If I hadn’t grown up in an upper middle class family, would I be in tech right now? Probably not. I might have eventually had access to a computer at school and maybe that would&#8217;ve been enough, but it&#8217;s very different having had access to a lot of really interesting pieces of technology very young and very early and being able to just play with these things and grow to love them.</p>\n<p><b>Where do you find your support networks?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professionally or personally?</span></p>\n<p><b>Both.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, I&#8217;ve been very fortunate in terms of the circles of friends that were around me through my transition. The nature of all those relationships changed more than I thought it would. But in pretty much all cases, it was positive – even when that meant the distance in some of those relationships increased. I had a good group of friends to begin with, and that group turned into what I needed it to be. The nature of that circle of friends has changed and who I&#8217;m close to and who I&#8217;m not, but I have some absolutely amazing people in my life that are there when I need them, and people that I can count on when I feel like I can count on no one else.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;My experiences have made me a big advocate and champion for how to we empirically cut biases out of these processes, how do we give more opportunities to people from underprivileged backgrounds, how do we make tech a more equitable place?

I&#8217;ve only been functioning in the professional world in a gender-variant way and then trans way for like the last four years. I don&#8217;t think I really gained much during the genderqueer portion of that, but once I transitioned and was presenting fully female, I have been able to establish some really good professional contacts. I was able to get more involved in organizations like Lesbians Who Tech and connect with other ladies in tech. That&#8217;s been very helpful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a huge thing walking into GitHub and finding that there was a built-in support network of ladies there, who are in technology. And having lady managers as peers was actually a big thing. My previous company was too small for me to have any peers, let alone peers of the same gender as mine. That&#8217;s been huge. And that&#8217;s very recent, but there&#8217;s a couple of those people I know that long after I leave this place, they will still support me. I know who to go talk to. There&#8217;s experience and depth there.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you feel like your life experience has shaped the way that you approach your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It definitely shapes how I view the projects I&#8217;m working on. </span>I am fortunate to get to take on a project that is directly related to being part of an underprivileged group. I have friends who&#8217;ve been deeply harassed for being trans online. Being able to directly work to change that is an incredible professional opportunity.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a fairly quiet online profile right now. Because of that, I haven&#8217;t faced a lot of direct harassment myself. But I&#8217;ve watched this play out in some friends&#8217; lives. It’s personal. It is a very real thing, and being able to do something very real about it is very meaningful.</span></p>\n<p>Earlier we were talking a little bit about really grasping the level of privilege that exists if you are a perceived straight, white, cis male. I&#8217;m not white, but I&#8217;m “white enough,” at least in the Bay Area. That&#8217;s definitely something I&#8217;ve started to understand better recently. Maybe some place else, I wouldn&#8217;t be white enough.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We want the a diverse spectrum of candidates.

I want other people to care about diversity inclusion. I want other people that are different than me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also want other people who might be like me. If you&#8217;re the only lady on a team, you desperately want to add another lady to that team. If you find someone who is qualified, you&#8217;re going to fight for them. Similarly, like if you&#8217;re a person of color, or if you&#8217;re a trans. Occasionally will have an interview where the video chat will come up, and I will suspect that the candidate is trans. I will want to give her extra privilege. And I have to actually fight a different type of bias there.  I still have to evaluate her on the same criteria I would any other candidate. Even though personally, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;d love to hire you just because you&#8217;re like me.&#8221; It&#8217;s the same thing. It&#8217;s an odd sensation.</span></p>\n<p><b>Totally.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It ties in a little bit to my experiences, being functionally the same candidate presenting male and presenting female. It&#8217;s not that I answered questions differently, or did less well on the technical portions. It was like, yeah I&#8217;ve dealt with a lot of identity stuff, but that didn&#8217;t change in how smart I was. That didn&#8217;t change in how well I do in technical interviews. None of that changed, and yet the responses to me changed dramatically.</span></p>\n<p><b>Did you experience similar biases when you were employed as well?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh,  I can talk about that little bit. In my previous position, it was a place where they all knew me through my transition (which was gradual). Having folks who are not close to you on a personal level see you in both genders is a little odd. I definitely saw ways where I was treated differently after transitioning. </span>In the 15 years of my career prior to transitioning I was never, ever labeled as “aggressive.” Sometimes “assertive,” even “overly energetic,” “frenetic.” All sorts of labels would be applied to me, but never “aggressive.” Post-transition I got that feedback constantly. Especially when I was seeking any form of promotion – where that very behavior that almost guarantees reward of promotion in a male – it was used as criteria to claim that I was unsuited for a particular promotion.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;In the 15 years of my career prior to transitioning I was never, ever labeled as &#8216;aggressive.&#8217; Sometimes &#8216;assertive,&#8217; even &#8216;overly energetic,&#8217; &#8216;frenetic.&#8217; All sorts of labels would be applied to me, but never &#8216;aggressive.&#8217; Post-transition I got that feedback constantly.

I learned a lot about what good code looks like. When I was writing device drivers, I worked for this guy who was a terrible people manager, but a marvelous coder. He wrote beautiful code. That was when I really developed a sense of what beautiful code is. He was the type of person who wrote such beautiful code that almost anything you presented to him, he would not be super happy with. The highest praise was if you put something in front of him and he&#8217;d just scowl at it, but he&#8217;d have nothing to say. He would be essentially unhappy with it because it wasn’t something that he wrote, but he couldn&#8217;t actually come up with any criticism. I learned a lot from that.</span></p>\n<p>I feel like I learned a lot about software management from watching a lot of people do it poorly. It&#8217;s an area where I can&#8217;t actually talk about a good mentor I have had because it&#8217;s a case where I, for the most part, just watched people fumble. I&#8217;ve also watched people who fumbled in many areas and then did one or two things right. I&#8217;ve tried to glean all these little bits. My strength as a manager is in aggregating all these lessons I&#8217;ve learned over years of watching people do things, both good and bad.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was also a time when I had someone further up in the organization, two levels above me, at the start of my career, who saw potential in me as a leader. She started working with me to develop leadership traits and took time to meet with me one-on-one. That was actually really powerful now that I think back on it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was pre-transition for me. I never realized at the time what it must have taken for her to reach that level in that company as a woman. Now I can only imagine the battles she had to fight and what she had to do to get there. What an honor it was that she took time to mentor me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More recently, I&#8217;ve been at a lot of startups and smaller firms. You often have a lot less opportunities for mentorship in those cases. You have a lot of opportunities for growth, but essentially if you&#8217;re at too small of a company, you have to look for external mentorship. This goes back to the identity thing I was talking about. If you don&#8217;t have a strong sense of self it&#8217;s hard to have really solid goals about what you wanna do with your career. Without clear goals it is easy to neglect mentorship and other career development.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It fascinates me that the shift into my actual gender was accompanied by a much clearer set of career and personal goals. </span>Without low level psychological needs being met you can be blind to the higher level stuff. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And it&#8217;s weird that you can be unaware that those needs are not being met.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you feel the state of tech in 2016? You&#8217;ve been here for a long time. What excites you, what frustrates you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The thing that excites me the most, is that </span>the conversation around diversity in tech feels like it is taking on a very vibrant life and it is very real. It&#8217;s both data-driven and personal, and we&#8217;re seeing that conversation play out, and we&#8217;re seeing the beginnings of real change. On the flipside, we&#8217;re seeing some really nasty counter-arguments, and we&#8217;re seeing a lot of people basically defend this concept of, &#8220;No. It&#8217;s a meritocracy. If you&#8217;re having issues, it&#8217;s because you are not good enough,&#8221; yet the data says that’s wrong.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The conversation around diversity in tech feels like it is taking on a very vibrant life and it is very real.

And my hope is that those companies that are doing something about it don&#8217;t just play lip service to diversity and inclusion, but actually really step into that role and say, &#8220;We are going to do this really well,&#8221; and especially if they then see the rewards and they see economic benefits. That will really help as time moves forward, we&#8217;ll see a lot. We&#8217;ll see big shifts. If you look at other industries that had deal more direct with affirmative action in the 70s and 80s, you&#8217;ll see this indeed happened. Even some industries that are still known for being incredibly sexist. Take Law, which is known for having some really nasty misogyny baked into the system and yet we&#8217;re also still seeing that female lawyers are pretty big percentage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I see tech in a position to actually do better. I want to see tech sidestep the “lean in” approach. Can tech avoid teaching everyone from diverse background to simply behave like the status quo? Can we instead bring a diversity of approaches and personalities into the workplace? </span>The status quo is to expect underprivileged people to to go and behave like the white men in the industry. The more you can behave like these men, the better you will do.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We&#8217;re seeing in tech companies that are willing to actually move women into leadership. We do even better when we don&#8217;t just look for the women that emulate men but we look for women and people of diverse backgrounds that just are themselves. They bring a slightly different tone and perspective on things, as opposed to just the very stereotypical driven Type A masculine. Type A females are great but they are very different than their male counterparts in terms of their approach and what their goals are. And we&#8217;re seeing this type of shift, very slowly. I feel like we&#8217;re just at the beginning of this, which is a little painful, but we&#8217;re seeing that these shifts are happening and that there are more opportunities.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The status quo is to expect underprivileged people to to go and behave like the white men in the industry. The more you can behave like these men, the better you will do.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And we&#8217;re definitely seeing a lot more companies trying to just fix their diversity from this big number-game side of it and be like, &#8220;Well, we need to hire more women, we need to hire more people of color.&#8221; And that by itself is not good enough, because we&#8217;ll continue to maintain the reality, </span>most women and people of color leave tech after less than 10 years. If we just hire diversity and we don&#8217;t build support networks, these people will be bullied out.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At my current company, I am part of several internal support networks. We are building sub-communities around being Latina or being a woman, etc. We are building these support networks internally in parallel with our recruiting efforts, and that&#8217;s a huge deal. And I&#8217;m seeing a couple other companies that are doing a pretty good job of that too. They understand that they can&#8217;t just hire people from diverse background, because they&#8217;ll end up leaving. You have to actually put a support system in for them. And as we see that, we&#8217;re seeing this growth and this vibrancy, and you see these just amazing things.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Most women and people of color leave tech after less than 10 years.

That&#8217;s just an exciting thing to be working on, and I&#8217;m really excited to be recruiting and hiring for that, and trying to put in really solid processes around how we&#8217;re going about building the software we need. That&#8217;s exciting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a pseudo-professional note, I&#8217;m trying to do a lot more speaking and writing about these topics. There&#8217;s a reason I&#8217;m openly trans on the internet. I made a very conscious decision about that a year ago. I could very well be stealth on the internet. I can mostly be stealth in person, but I made a conscious decision that I have this privilege and if I&#8217;m stealth, I give up my voice. And it&#8217;s really hard to drive changes solely from the perspective of outsiders who are allies without the voice of those who are actually affected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of my big things for 2016 is doing a lot more speaking, and writing about this very topic, and sharing my stories. </span>I&#8217;m an empiricist, so I want data on all this stuff. And I get frustrated. There&#8217;s not a lot of good data on many aspects of this. In some areas there&#8217;s great data. Like we know a lot about gender bias in terms of how it affects interviews. But there&#8217;s a lot less about how transphobia, or homophobia, etc come into play. So often the best we have is our stories and our anecdotes. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And especially since they&#8217;re very real. We may not be able to statistically prove that this is happening, but we can appeal to people’s life experiences and hope they say, &#8220;Oh, yeah. That happened. I could totally see that happening more, and that shouldn&#8217;t be happening. What can I do about it?&#8221; I definitely am trying to use my voice to make the world a better place for anybody from a non-privileged background.</span></p>\n<p><b>I would love to hear you speak. You&#8217;re so eloquent in everything you’ve said here.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in five or ten years? Do you think you&#8217;ll still be in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Probably. I could see using some of my work, in terms of the trust and safety, could move me someplace different. But, if I do that it would still be someplace clearly related to these very issues of making sure that people have safe and inclusive spaces and that we&#8217;re building these types of places both in real life and on the internet. If I stay in tech I definitely hope to tackle some level of upper executive-style work within the tech industry. I think I have a lot to draw on in terms of that, and that&#8217;s a direction I would like to see my career go long-term.</span></p>\n<p><b>What advice would you give to folks going through similar struggles or coming from similar backgrounds to you in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s a hard one, because there&#8217;s a degree where I want to say,&#8221;Don&#8217;t give up.&#8221; And there&#8217;s another part of me that feels like that&#8217;s the most flippant advice in the world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was incredibly emotionally destructive for me to deal with the rejections of interviews I knew went well. I expected to be rejected for something that didn&#8217;t go very well, or I could tell we were just on different pages regarding management style. But the interviews where it was clear that we synced and it was clear that there was a good match and a good fit…. To get turned down for those was just unbearable. And no, not just once or twice — the first couple times you dismiss it. By the third and fourth time, it was really so incredibly emotionally destructive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s hard for me in good faith to say, &#8220;Just stick it out, it&#8217;ll be fine.&#8221; We need diverse people in tech. I don&#8217;t know what the answer is there. It makes me sad that that&#8217;s the case.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m an empiricist, so I want data on all this stuff. And I get frustrated. There&#8217;s not a lot of good data on many aspects of this. In some areas there&#8217;s great data. Like we know a lot about gender bias in terms of how it affects interviews. But there&#8217;s a lot less about how transphobia, or homophobia, etc come into play. So often the best we have is our stories and our anecdotes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We need to keep fighting to eliminate these biases and make sure people really do have a fair chance. Yet I know that not every company is trying to do that, and so I don&#8217;t know what the answer is. </span>There&#8217;s a school of thought out there advocating that underprivileged folks should just be the entrepreneur and go that route. But then you have the problem of, yeah, you can do that, but the bias is then going to happen to you at the funding level.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best I can do is try to leverage the privilege in my life to improve these situations. I have this privilege, I have a job, I have a position, I have authority. I can use that to try to fix these problems from that side. What do I tell someone who is young and up-and-coming? I can say, don&#8217;t even apply at the places that are shitty?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[laughter]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t know how you make it. We&#8217;ve built a system that is so just difficult and ultimately cruel. I&#8217;m really hoping to see some of the very big players build out better programs for early engineers, early career engineers. I&#8217;m also hoping to see them build out better support systems for people in their mid-to-late career so that they can bring in women and people of color that have managed to survive and make it a good place to be. We have to see some big changes, both from start-ups and also from the big players, the big employers, the ones that employ tens of thousands and not just a few hundred here and there.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><strong>Tell me about your early years and where you come from.</strong></p>\n<p>I was born in Kansas City, Kansas, not Missouri. Very important distinction if you&#8217;re from Kansas City! I grew up with a very Midwestern lifestyle. My dad is a biologist, my mom was a nurse and a social worker—both of them super idealistic. For most of my childhood I lived on this state park, and my dad was the caretaker but also helping raise the money to permanently save the land. It was this 300-­acre plot of original prairie. A lot of my early memories were of him running this summer camp and taking care of all kinds of wild animals and running around on the prairie. I went to college at University of Kansas, so I stayed fairly local. I had planned to go to law school and follow a more idealistic path, follow in their footsteps, but ended up in college falling into video games. And that was the inflection point that changed everything.</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah, so you accidentally became the world&#8217;s first professional female gamer.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, very accidentally. I was at the University of Kansas living in a dorm on the Honors floor. I had been elected the president of all the dorms, so I was living in this apartment, not a normal dorm room. And I was hanging out with mostly all these guys. I had always had guy friends. They were telling me about this game they were playing and they started getting me playing Doom. I loved it, so I got into Doom with them. Then they started telling me about this other game that was coming out—a sequel called Quake. When Quake came out, we all played together and we formed a clan, which is like a Quake team. We formed one of the very first clans and it was me and seven guys. To me, this was totally normal. Our clan was actually pretty competitive, and we ended up winning the very first clan tournament ever. We eventually moved into a house (though I technically didn&#8217;t live there). The eight of us were in this house just playing Quake 24/7. And, we were hosting LAN parties and having all of these people come visit us from all over the country. Other Quake clans would drive from multiple states to come play with us in person. And, this is in the days of 21 inch CRTs that were so heavy, but we were carrying them around competing and playing. So we had this whole scene going on and we all got really good. I was competitive with those guys, with one exception. We had one player who was just phenomenal, one of the best in the world.</p>\n<p>At that time we started getting to know some of the guys in Dallas around the shooter scene there, where some of the most noteworthy teams were making first person shooter games. We started getting to know them and that included the developers of Quake. We even drove down to Dallas to talk to them in person. On one of the trips down to Dallas, a friend had met John Romero, who was a designer of Quake. This friend knew I was really good at games, and on my behalf he threw down a challenge. He told Romero, &#8220;There is this girl&#8230; she could kick your ass, and she wants to play you.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There was a ton of harassment and hate and sexism and abuse. People would send me hate email all the time. The emails were not just things like &#8216;women shouldn&#8217;t be in games,&#8217; but very intensely personal and insulting. Every inch of my body was criticized, every aspect of my personality.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>So without my blessing and on my behalf he had thrown the gauntlet down. I had no idea if I could beat the guy or not, but over a couple of weeks we coordinated the time and we ended up going down there for this match. By the time we arrived, a lot of people in the gaming community had heard about it and there was actually gaming press there. We played at his office in Dalla s­­he was like a legend at this point ­­he was kind of a celebrity in the video gaming world. We were playing best out of three death matches and he won the first of the three, and then in the second game we were playing to 25 and he was up like 19 to 3, and I remember at that point he said something sexist. I just remember thinking that I cannot let this happen. I can’t lose. I can’t stomach what’s to come if I lose this match and all of the taunting that will come with it. I can do better than this and I&#8217;ve got to turn this around. And just like that I went on a rampage. I ended up winning that match and the next one, so I beat him the best two out of three.</p>\n<p>After I won, it turned into “a thing” and I got a lot of coverage in gaming magazines and he had to create an online shrine to me. It just all snowballed from there. I was in gaming magazines. I got an offer of sponsorship from a competitive league to be their first full time paid cyber athlete and help this organization recruit a team of other pro video gamers. I had sponsorships from joystick companies and I got the chance to travel around the world and play in video game tournaments. It was a blast. But, it was not planned. It was very much a surprise.</p>\n<p><strong>What were some of the best moments of that time for you. What were your favorite things about that experience?</strong></p>\n<p>The thing I remember most about that experience was that it opened up the world for me. I had never been out of the country. I grew up in Kansas City and had been there pretty much my whole life until this point. It opened up all these experiences and other cultures and things I never really even knew were accessible. I got to travel to other countries and people hosted me in their homes. It was a great education. And I had never really thought, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d love to leave the country but it&#8217;s not possible.&#8221; It&#8217;s almost like I didn&#8217;t realize it was out there to be experienced. So for me this was an awakening and the first time that I saw the rest of the world. It was also just a surreal experience being strangely internet famous. It came with lots of pros and cons, but it was also a very unique, singular experience that not a lot of people get to have. Thanks to my internet fame, I met a lot of friends and interesting people. It connected me to the world in a way that I wouldn&#8217;t have experienced otherwise.</p>\n<p><strong>What were some of the tough parts and the tough lessons to learn?</strong></p>\n<p>The worst part was that even at that time ­ it was pre­-Facebook and pre-­Twitter and all of that ­even at that time I got a lot of harassment. There was a ton of harassment and hate and sexism and abuse. People would send me hate email all the time. The emails were not just things like &#8220;women shouldn&#8217;t be in games,&#8221; but very intensely personal and insulting. Every inch of my body was criticized, every aspect of my personality. People would dig up old pictures of me in high school and new pictures and write these elaborate multi-­page teardowns of every aspect of my being. At one point an ex-­boyfriend posted a lengthy insulting, derogatory post on one of the biggest gaming blogs at that time.</p>\n<p>It was exhausting because it just felt like I couldn&#8217;t escape it ­even at home. I didn&#8217;t get much harassment that went beyond the digital at that point thank goodness, but I did get a few phone calls. It just started to feel like I had all of the downside of being famous without any of the upside—like money. I lost a lot of privacy. But I wasn’t really making much money. I didn’t have any of the upside or protection that comes with some types of fame. There was no real benefit to this. The benefit of connecting with people was so drowned out by how bad it felt to be in the spotlight. It really made me realize that I did not want to live like that. It was not an enjoyable way to be in the world, and it took its toll on my relationships. It just made­­ it made me view people as much more hostile than I had ever thought they might be.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It just started to feel like I had all of the downside of being famous without any of the upside—like money.

The benefit of connecting with people was so drowned out by how bad it felt to be in the spotlight.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Yeah, for sure. So how&#8217;d you get out?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, I kind of slowly backed away, you know? I quietly just backed my way out of the room. I was in a relationship—I had ended up dating that designer of Doom and Quake. We were in a relationship and we dated for five years, and it was pretty serious, but I ended up breaking up with him. And when that happened I moved to LA and away from Dallas. I took an initial job in games, but I made a conscious decision that I was going to start to look at other opportunities that would be adjacent but not directly in games. I consciously made an effort to step back from some of the press opportunities. I just slowly backed away from the attention.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t an overnight decision. I didn&#8217;t do anything dramatic. I just felt like, &#8220;I have to get away from this, because it feels miserable and exhausting on a day-­to-­day basis.” At that time, I was working for Warner Brothers and I met this sales guy, Matt Golden, at a vendor who was selling technology to us. I was making games at WB, but Matt and I really hit it off. I thought he was great, and at one point he called me up and offered me an opportunity to take a junior sales role working for him. I&#8217;d never done sales before and I considered myself quite shy. He said, &#8220;I think I can teach you to sell, and you&#8217;ll be selling a little bit to game companies, but other companies as well.&#8221; So I jumped at that chance and that was a fork in the road for me. Ever since then, I&#8217;ve touched games, I&#8217;ve never completely left them, but I&#8217;ve never worked full-time in the industry since that point.</p>\n<p><strong>Was there any reaction from the community of, &#8220;Hey, where are you, we want to keep abusing you?&#8221; Or did they just move on to the next thing?</strong></p>\n<p>They just moved on to the next thing. I would occasionally get little pings, positive and negative. Even to this day­­ it&#8217;s hilarious to me, but even now I&#8217;ll occasionally walk into a meeting and somebody will say, &#8220;Hey, I know you. I remember who you are.&#8221; Occasionally, things will pop up online or somebody will post about me, and it&#8217;s fifty­-fifty. Sometimes it&#8217;s kind of positive and friendly and other times it&#8217;s negative and derogatory. But more than anything, the interest just faded away, and I was grateful for that. It is honestly what I was hoping would happen. It really was a gradual pulling away from the entire thing.</p>\n<p><strong>And now you&#8217;re an executive in technology. How did all of that experience, good and bad, inform your work now?</strong></p>\n<p>It informs my work in so many ways. I have been quite lucky, because that experience in gaming opened a lot of doors. It is still a great conversation starter, or sometimes it&#8217;s the reason somebody knows my name and makes a connection. So I took that baseline and went down a different path and found some great mentors. These folks taught me new skills that could build on top of my knowledge of gaming.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest things I took away from my experience in gaming is that it was (and still is) a male-­dominated culture and industry. But I thrived in that environment and I made some great friends and connections. There were many great things about that experience, and I feel like I learned how to relate and thrive in that very male culture.</p>\n<p>Silicon Valley (where I work now) is actually not much different. A lot of my time since those days has been in sales and business development. It is still an extremely male culture. It&#8217;s also a culture filled with highly intelligent people. Similarly, gaming culture was filled with extremely bright and passionate people. I see a lot of the similarities between those gamers that I used to socialize with and the people I sell technology to now, even if they&#8217;re not gamers. The personality types are similar, the interests are similar, and the way that I’ve been able to relate to them and gain credibility is similar.</p>\n<p>In the end, building on that experience has been quite helpful, and it makes me feel comfortable and at ease because this is my spot. Even though I&#8217;m still often the only woman in the room, I feel like this is my place, this is what I&#8217;ve always been a part of. That comfort level was gained through my experience in gaming.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was going into the office everyday and like, &#8216;Yep, everything&#8217;s amazing and this is great and I’m here to crush it,&#8217; and just executing on my job and nobody knew. Nobody knew that at home I had this young daughter who was crying for her dad who no longer was willing to see her, and that I was about to be evicted.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Throughout this whole time or most of this time, you&#8217;ve been a single mom. How is that?</strong></p>\n<p>Being a full custody single parent is difficult, regardless of the circumstances. It is by far the hardest thing I have ever done. Trying to combine being that with being a tech executive has been incredibly challenging. All along I knew what I wanted for my daughter: I wanted to build a career that would inspire her. I also knew that I didn&#8217;t want to give myself up. I didn&#8217;t want to follow the motto of parenting that says, you dedicate all your time to your child, and you minimize time away. I wanted to have a life, too, because I wasn’t done living. My philosophy on parenting is that you build a life that shows your child how rich life can be, and how great and rewarding a career can be, and how great your friendships and relationships can be. So, I had this idea in my head of building an amazing life so she could see that and have that model. I feel like I&#8217;ve mostly done that, but it has been exceedingly hard because I feel like I have lived on a treadmill for the last decade of my life. From the second I wake up in the morning, I have a job. I have a job at home, and I&#8217;m a mom and I&#8217;m doing that and I go to work and it&#8217;s extremely intense and focused. And then I get home and I value that time at home with her so highly and I want that to be quality time. I try to give her that at the level of quality, the level of engagement that she deserves. It’s hard to succeed at that when I am so exhausted from working so hard all day at a challenging job. It&#8217;s tough, and trying to keep up the facade at work that I&#8217;m fine and I&#8217;m not exhausted and I&#8217;m not just completely run ragged is not easy.</p>\n<p>For the first five years of single parenting, I was also extremely broke. Right after I moved to San Francisco as a newly single mom, I was about 12 hours away from being evicted from my apartment here. And it was absolutely terrifying. And yet, I was going into the office everyday and like, &#8220;Yep, everything&#8217;s amazing and this is great and I’m here to crush it,&#8221; and just executing on my job and nobody knew. Nobody knew that at home I had this young daughter who was crying for her dad who no longer was willing to see her, and that I was about to be evicted. Trying to keep up that dual existence was just incredibly hard, and I am grateful it’s easier now. But I am also acutely aware of the fight that single parents must fight. It’s not easy.</p>\n<p>Balancing work and single parenting, I&#8217;ve often got this insanely ridiculous challenge going on at home, and yet the second I show up to work, I need to execute at a high level as if I&#8217;m just one of the other guys who&#8217;s 25 and single. Trying to maintain that level of energy, the enthusiasm, that facade that everything is fine­­ that has been the hardest part.</p>\n<p><strong>Where do you find you support networks? </strong></p>\n<p>I am extremely independent. I&#8217;m not good at asking for help and for the first six or seven years of being a single mom, I really did not ask for help unless it was truly an emergency. I kept to myself and I did not let people help me or even know I might need help. Over the last few years, I made a conscious decision that I need to let more people in, and I have formed this amazing network of really wonderful, supportive friends. I&#8217;m working on learning to be more vulnerable and tell them when I need help. They are amazing and always show up for me. The biggest change on this front was actually just a couple of months ago. I moved my mom, who is retired, out from Kansas City and into my house. Now she&#8217;s living with us, and we have a three generation female family going on right now [chuckles]</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I am extremely independent.

I kept to myself and I did not let people help me or even know I might need help.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Amazing. I want to go backward a little bit. Just even out of my own selfish curiosity. I deal with a tiny bit of hate that slowly increases every time I do better at something, but I&#8217;m learning to not give a shit, and I feel so much better about it since starting to learn that process and apply it. Like the fact that you have had every inch of your body criticized and yet you were able to pose for Playboy—how are you able to go from experiencing what no human really should experience in terms of humanity and then just et it roll off your back? Or does it never roll off your back?</strong></p>\n<p>Honestly, it never rolls off my back. As much as I wish I could tell you that I don&#8217;t give a shit, I do ­ even when I don&#8217;t want to. And it&#8217;s really hard. It still bothers me, always. I think it’s unrealistic to expect that sort of harassment or abuse to just roll off. It’s an inhumane task, and I think it puts undue pressure on the receiver of that abuse. What I&#8217;ve gotten better at is shortening the amount of time that things bother me. I give myself permission to be upset and be offended and be hurt because I deserve that. I should be offended, and it’s not OK to be treated like that. But then I make a conscious decision that continuing that letting myself feel bad any longer is actually hurting me. So there&#8217;s an end to it. I make a conscious decision to move on. I&#8217;ve accepted that this stuff is always going to bother me. I&#8217;m always going to care. I do make different decisions now, because I know the weight of online abuse. But I&#8217;m also extremely competitive, and I firmly believe that the best form of revenge or payback is simply to win. Any time I get upset, any time I&#8217;m hurt, I just let it flow through. And then I double back down and I tell myself that I&#8217;ve just got to fight through it. And there may not be an immediate victory, there may not be that sweet feeling of revenge right away or a sense that I&#8217;ve avenged a wrong. But I know that in the fullness of time, I will succeed and that that will be the proof that the critics were wrong.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Honestly, it never rolls off my back.

I think it’s unrealistic to expect that sort of harassment or abuse to just roll off.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>What would you say are your biggest motivators?</strong></p>\n<p>My number one motivator in life is providing a great life for my daughter. I am a big believer that providing a great life for my daughter includes living a great life myself. That central desire to show her what a great life looks like guides a lot of my decisions. It guides me to take risks and to push myself to go out and even have fun when I might be more inclined to isolate and stay at home. I don&#8217;t want her to see me as this person who just isolates and sits on the couch. That idea drives me to push myself in all areas. Beyond that, I am compelled by learning and challenging myself. I love to be challenged and to feel like I&#8217;m always growing. I know that when I feel that little hint of discomfort, that I&#8217;m probably doing the right thing. I know I&#8217;m challenging myself just a little bit in a way that I&#8217;m not comfortable with, and I like that feeling because that’s how I know I&#8217;m on to something.</p>\n<p><strong>How has having a kid­­ and really all of your experiences affected your priorities? Particularly in terms of what you look for in a job and future jobs?</strong></p>\n<p>Having a daughter has made me look at opportunities differently than I would have expected. I think I would have expected that it would make me more cautious, but having her actually has made me a little bit more of a risk taker in some ways. I feel a little more compelled to take a shot at things that might seem unattainable. There&#8217;s always this balance in my head of risk versus playing the role of the caregiver and sole breadwinner in my family, and needing to ensure our financial security. So there&#8217;s always the pull of needing to play it safe with really swinging for the fences for my daughter to watch. And usually that &#8220;swing for the fences&#8221; desire wins out. I try to push myself in that direction. I&#8217;ve never been very good about middle ground. I don&#8217;t do well in the gray area. I&#8217;m in or I&#8217;m out. I don&#8217;t like to just hang out and chill. In every role I&#8217;m in, if I&#8217;m not 100% invested and I am not in it to win it, then I might as well not be there. I&#8217;m not really capable of doing the normal 9 to 5 thing. I suppose that having my daughter has intensified both the desire for security and the desire to take risks. But that desire to take risks is the one that usually wins.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you love about working in tech after all these years?</strong></p>\n<p>I love working in tech because it forces me to be creative on a number of different planes. You have to synthesize so much information, whether it&#8217;s about technology or solutions or people. There are so many aspects to consider in a situation, and you’re often solving new problems. There’s no clean template to work from. That multifaceted challenge is what I enjoy. Most of my time in tech has been in some kind of a sales role, and usually I&#8217;m doing highly technical sales.</p>\n<p>My job often feels like piecing together a puzzle. I love figuring out how to motivate another company with very, very intelligent employees to work with your company and use your technology. It takes more than people skills and it takes more than technical skills. The blend of those two things is really compelling for me. I feel like I&#8217;m always having to find a new strategy, and really deeply listen to people to understand how to be successful.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I love working in tech because it forces me to be creative on a number of different planes.

There’s no clean template to work from.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Yeah. Let&#8217;s go macro for a second. How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? What is exciting to you, what&#8217;s frustrating to you, what would you like to see change?</strong></p>\n<p>I think the state of tech is pretty frustrating. I don&#8217;t feel like the situation for women has improved in any meaningful way over the last few years. I see a lot of talk about it, so many tweets and posts and meetups. But my own experience has not improved in that time, and in talking to my peers and my mentors their experiences aren&#8217;t improving either. I find that really disheartening.</p>\n<p>The reality still is that there are pockets of more diverse teams and there are pockets where there are more women. But I&#8217;m not encountering those pockets very often. It&#8217;s still a very isolating experience to be a woman in tech for me. There are some brilliant, badass women out there, but in my day-­to-­day it is rare for me to interact with women.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s still a very isolating experience to be a woman in tech for me.

I want to be a part of transforming peoples’ lives and making them better and easier. That&#8217;s exciting to me. What is concerning to me is the dearth of women on the teams building those technologies. Women’s needs and the way we live our lives are not necessarily taken into account in the same way when this new tech gets built. Some of that is intentional, but I think more of that exclusion is simply out of ignorance.</p>\n<p>When people design products, they are limited by their own life experience, needs, and perceptions. It&#8217;s only natural that men would design experiences for their needs more effectively than they might design for women. I worry that as they become so much more prevalent and so much more mainstream that the divide between men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s experiences of the world is only going to get bigger.</p>\n<p>I appreciate all of the work being done on the “pipeline problem” of bringing more women into the tech workforce. That is important work. However, I strongly believe that the pipeline is not the core problem at this point. There are some deep cultural issues we need to face as an industry to reduce churn before filling the pipe can ever be really effective.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;When people design products, they are limited by their own life experience, needs, and perceptions.

Do you think you&#8217;ll still be here?</strong></p>\n<p>I do not think I will live in the Bay Area. I am really fortunate to own a home here, but even being in the top 1% of income earners, I struggle to maintain the type of life I want for my daughter here. It&#8217;s exceedingly hard to raise a family here. We’re failing the kids in our public schools here while rich kids just go to private school. Living in the Bay Area and working in tech feels like a treadmill that I can&#8217;t quite get off. I&#8217;m having fun; I&#8217;m still running and I&#8217;m smiling, but I&#8217;m 39 years old this year and I&#8217;m starting to think about how sustainable this is. Can I continue? Absolutely. Do I want to continue to run at this pace with so little gain? I don&#8217;t think so. I want to keep building businesses and I want to participate in this, but I also want to change the game for myself. I would love to see myself in five to ten years owning my own company, but not necessarily a venture backed company. I would love to start more of a lifestyle business that I can feel good about and believe in, but is also compatible with having a family, and having a great home life, and enjoying life. Life is short, and I want to enjoy that time and not lose my entire life to this work.</p>\n<p><strong>What advice would you give to young women hoping to get into tech? </strong></p>\n<p>The number one piece of advice I would give to women in our position would be to be aggressive even if it is not your nature. Get out there and advocate for yourself. You don’t have to change your personality. But you do have to fight for yourself and for your outcomes. There is such a level of reward for aggressiveness and the “cult of the hustle” is so celebrated in the valley. There are some good reasons for that, because hustle is great and it gets things done and it gets you out there and gets your product out there. Relentless hustle is often required to build a successful business. And what I find is that other styles aren&#8217;t necessarily as celebrated or appreciated today in this world. Right or wrong, if you want that opportunity you have to adapt and be aggressive and hustle and put yourself out there without apologies. Don&#8217;t feel bad about it, don&#8217;t be ashamed of it. Ask yourself, &#8220;Why not me?&#8221; When you look around at different opportunities, whatever they may be, look at the people there and say, &#8220;Why not me? Why couldn&#8217;t I do that? Is there a real reason that I can&#8217;t? Is there something special about them that I don&#8217;t have?&#8221; And the truth is that almost always there&#8217;s not. There&#8217;s no reason why you can&#8217;t get there. I remind myself of that when I start feeling a little “less than.” I&#8217;m every bit as capable and intelligent as my competitors. The other thing that I try to remember is that everybody feels that level of insecurity. That is not abnormal.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The number one piece of advice I would give to women in our position would be to be aggressive even if it is not your nature.

So own it and don&#8217;t ever believe you are less than that.</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Let&#8217;s start from the beginning. Tell me about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1987, I was conceived, no—where I came from—as it relates to being a quote-unquote woman in technology, the origin story is probably about like this: I was a science nerd in high school. I was really into chemistry. I really liked my AP chemistry class. I was president of the science olympiad team, in Nashville, Tennessee. It was not a school that was particularly known for its academics, to be totally honest. I found my spot there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born in in Fremont, California. There were a few reasons my family moved to Nashville. One of them was the chaos of being a student in the Bay Area at that time. My parents are aging hippies and they just weren&#8217;t that into exposing their kids to that level of insanity. I sort of did my own thing for high school and I seemed to turn out okay, so I appreciate that. I was a science olympiad nerd. I applied to a couple of different schools. I got into M.I.T. to study chemistry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s actually my first degree, I have a Bachelor&#8217;s degree in chemistry. While I was pursuing a chemistry degree, I had a bunch of friends who were pursuing computer science degrees. I would look at them out of the corner of my eye and see what they were learning. It seemed pretty different. Compared to what I was learning it seemed like they were learning a toolkit for solving arbitrary problems in the world in a way that was really cross-disciplinary. I felt I was learning the history of chemistry in a way that could be really fun for some people, but what they were doing seemed very broadly appealing and relevant. I ended up taking a couple of CS classes. I actually sort of illicitly pursued a computer science internship without telling my chemistry advisor. He was quite unhappy with me when he found out about that. I ended up liking it a lot, and I ended up getting a bachelor&#8217;s degree in computer science as well. I got a master&#8217;s degree in computer science, and the rest is history. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s how I got started. I did take a couple programing classes in high school, although I wouldn&#8217;t claim that I understood the power of it then. I really started pursuing the discipline in college. I think that&#8217;s actually important to note because a lot of my friends at school had been programming since they were babies. This meant that I had a lot of catching up to do. This instilled in me a very serious and personal empathy for beginners. I also had to validate for myself that if you work hard, and if you work harder than anybody else you can catch up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I did that. As I got my master’s degree, I had some friends who were starting a startup called KSplice. KSplice&#8217;s story is the gift that keeps on giving, like the Silicon Valley, like the HBO show Silicon Valley has derived a number of entertaining stories from KSplice the start up. We were all computer nerds together at MIT&#8217;s computing club. They started KSplice around a technology for rebootless kernel updates on Linux. It&#8217;s like a very exciting, serious, distance program, a challenge.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The good people and the smart people are going to treat you equally and like a human being and not like a woman in technology.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They were a little bit older than me so when I graduated, I joined them as an early kernel engineering hire at the startup. We built it into a real business that ended up making money, being profitable. We did a bunch of goofy stuff during that time. This is like the authentic startup experience where we were working at the house where all the founders lived. It was a disaster. Dubiously zoned. We&#8217;d all have to hide when the landlord came by. There were mice everywhere. Dudes were showering with their girlfriends during the workday. All kinds of goofy stuff that has made it into various Silicon Valley episodes. It was a really good experience in learning what it means to build something from scratch. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Totally self-funded. Didn&#8217;t take any outside investment. We worked all the time, didn&#8217;t pay ourselves for a long time. That company was acquired by Oracle, and we hung out at Oracle for a little while. We left Oracle, went back to one of our apartments and continued to startup number two with the same team. Startup number two was called Zulip, it was building a real-time collaboration service for businesses. Sort of like Slack before Slack was Slack. Did the Zulip thing for a while. Zulip was acquired by Dropbox about two years ago. Now I&#8217;m at Dropbox where I&#8217;m an engineering director and a chief of staff for a VP of Engineering.</span></p>\n<p><b>How was your experience as a female entrepreneur?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good people and the smart people are going to treat you equally and like a human being and not like a woman in technology.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The people that I was very intentionally surrounding myself with, like my peers at MIT and then my co-founders, are awesome and we work well together and we trust each other. I would take a bullet for those guys. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was never an issue. I wasn&#8217;t the face of fundraising because my role as a founder was to run engineering organization. Our CEO and our COO were all fundraising while we were busy building the product.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first time in the context of my professional career that I had a rude awakening about this: We had this really, really successful blog. We got really good at writing blog posts that we&#8217;d get a bunch of attention from the tech community. We knew how to get to the top of hacker news. We once made the mistake of having a blog post that included a picture of us. That is when I had the great pleasure of receiving a lot of commentary about how I looked in a blog post that was, otherwise, about engineering. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was maybe the rudest awakening. There were also a lot of people misgendering me when talking about the author in the blog post, even though my name in Jessica. That would be a small cut in a death by a thousand papercuts situation. I don&#8217;t really try to put my face out on the internet, especially on things that are closely associated with my social media, because it&#8217;s not that fun.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I always felt really good about running a startup and the people I was surrounded by. Now at Dropbox, I am the most senior woman at the company currently. I believe I have a tremendous amount of freedom and flexibility and respect. I feel good about that, but again, I think it&#8217;s who you surround yourself with that matters. There are plenty of assholes that you could maybe end up being surrounded by, but the good people and the smart people, they know what&#8217;s up. They know what actually matters is having great people, totally respective of their gender or other qualities. </span></p>\n<p><b>How did you end up as a technical consultant for Silicon Valley (the TV show)?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The show is this wonderful uncanny view of the valley and what&#8217;s uncomfortable about this industry. I only worked it tech for a few years, but I made it through one episode and it was like &#8220;This is too real&#8221; and I couldn&#8217;t get through. Like I said, Ksplice is really like the gift that keeps on giving. So what happened was that the Silicon Valley writers they were doing a tour of a bunch of the startups in the valley and they came to Dropbox. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our PR team was like, &#8220;Who are some entertaining people in engineering?&#8221; and my name came up. They shoved 25 people into a conference room to ask questions. They wanted to just hear ambient stories that could be interesting and they wanted to dig in a little bit on storage, which is part of a plotline for season one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I seized upon the opportunity to regale them with many amusing anecdotes from Ksplice. It was all kinds of goofy stuff. The service we were building is a technology for rebootless kernel updates on linux. You care about rebootless kernel on linux if you have a lot of computers and if you have a lot of computers frequently you are a hosting company or you are in the porn industry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I just have so many stories around debugging technical issues on the computers of various companies in the porn industry, and they are just very funny. I thought that if it could tell a bunch of these goofy stories to the Silicon Valley writers and they thought I was sufficiently entertaining that they wanted to keep talking to me so we kept meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They would ask me funny questions and I would tell them stories. I ended up becoming a senior technical consultant, which is important because James Cowling, who is another person from Dropbox, who is a technical consultant for the show, he’s just a technical consultant. So my name is in every credits and his is only in the episodes he directly contributed to. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was fun and we- James and I together- helped design their little data center from season two. They invited us to the taping for scene one of episode one of season two, which is filmed at AT&amp;T Park. They had all the celebs out, the Winklevoss were there. Drew and Raj made the cameos in their goofy stuff. It was fun to watch the behind the scenes take on how this stuff gets made. It was fun.</span></p>\n<p><b>I love it. Let&#8217;s go into some of the other things. Aside from your job at Dropbox, you do a lot of work on improving diversity and inclusive culture at work and in the Python community. Tell me more.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started using Python in school. It is one of the primary languages that many IT classes are taught in. I used Python in all my internships. I&#8217;ve actually used Python in every job I&#8217;ve ever had. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My first ever contribution to an open source project was while I was an intern at VM Ware. I was using this library called Twisted, which is a Python library for event-driven networking in Python. I had noticed that some of the documentation was confusing, and I thought that this might be an opportunity to contribute back to an open source project. I heard that was a thing that you could do. It seemed scary, but maybe I could figure it out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I decided I was going to do it, but I was super nervous about it. I quadruple-checked all of the new contributor guidelines for this incredibly simple documentation badge. I agonized over the ticket creation, the title of the ticket, and the body of the ticket, and hovered my mouse over the submit button for multiple minutes, and it was like, &#8220;Someone is going to yell at me. This is going to be terrible.&#8221; I finally hit the submit button, and then, they&#8217;re like, the nicest people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Glyph, who is one of the creators at Twisted, who is now a good friend of mine, personally helped me through getting this first patch applied. He is super patient and helpful and nice. He is not at all intimidating, even though he&#8217;s the creator of the project, and had every reason to not help me. Despite being incredibly nervous, I had this super, super positive first experience with open source contribution, which is not what most experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anecdotally, that is not a typical. I think it ended up being good for Twisted, because I ended up contributing a lot more to the project. I ended up becoming a core maintainer for the project and writing a book on Twisted with O&#8217;Reilly. I really invested in the community over the years after that initial contribution. It also made me very aware of the fact that this is not an experience that everyone necessarily has. It made me very committed to wanting other people to have that experience as well. That has become my personal direction open source. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was happening and then in sort of a parallel work stream there was this program that was happening on the West Coast while I was still in Boston as a student. It is called RailsBridge, which is like one of the earlier efforts in this wave of diversity outreach, to get more women into the Ruby/Ruby and Rails community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got to talking with Ashish Leroya, a friend who is also an open source nerd too, about doing something like this in Boston. We didn&#8217;t know Ruby. We knew Python. We thought, &#8220;What if we just do this in the Python community?&#8221; So we hooked up with the Boston Python user group and convinced and Ned Batchelder. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We convinced this guy Ned, one of the long time organizers of Boston Python, to let us run an intro to Python workshop, specifically for women in Boston, under the Boston Python User Group. It was sort of a bold thing to do because I didn&#8217;t really know who we were. Getting the right messaging out can be a little tricky, but he was game for it. We ended up selling out, basically, immediately. It was free, but it ended up filling up immediately. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We ended up running a bunch of these. I became an organizer for the Boston Python User Group. Then the Boston Python User Group, in large part due to these types of initiatives and other very intentional initiatives around providing a more inclusive user group for people of various backgrounds.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;As it turns out, if you make an effort to be welcoming to one set of people, you will probably actually become more welcoming to everybody, which is the secret to all diversity, everybody just actually helps everyone.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boston is a great testing ground for this, because it has a very high density tech population. It is adjacent to a bunch of other stuff, like bio-tech, a lot of entrepreneurs, music is very big—so there are a bunch of adjacent fields that leverage programming that you can tap into if you do a good job of being welcoming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We ran a bunch of these diversity outreach workshops, and then a bunch of crazy statistics occurred. We set out a goal – it&#8217;s as true in my day job as in these open source communities – like you set a goal and then you measure it to know if you&#8217;re like actually doing what you intended to do. We had this goal around increasing the representation of women at user group events. We started at nearly 0% at user group events for women, wanting to boost that to 15%. We instantly achieved that by running these intro workshops and some follow-up events. It really became a pipeline of events.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then we were able to sustain that participation rate for several years. I&#8217;d have to check in with Ned about what the latest stats are, but while I was there in Boston, this represented a huge leap in the actual composition of the user group but also the way that it felt. It became a real poster-child/example set of processes that were adopted by user groups around the United States and globally. We gave a talk about this at PyCon, and it&#8217;s been replicated like all over the world, which is pretty amazing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I was an organizer for the Boston part of the user group, which is part of this initiative, became the largest user group in the world. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As it turns out, if you make an effort to be welcoming to one set of people, you will probably actually become more welcoming to everybody, which is the secret to all diversity, everybody just actually helps everyone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I then ran for and then became a director for the Python Software Foundation, which the non-profit and stewarding organization behind the Python programming language and community. I served as a director for a couple of years and I was also a co-chair for our Outreach and Education Committee, which provided a lot of funding to educational initiatives. They use Python. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the last three years I&#8217;ve been the diversity chair for Python. There are many Python conferences around the world. Python is the original big international conference that&#8217;s held in North America somewhere once a year. I&#8217;ve been the diversity chair for the past three years, so in the three years I&#8217;ve always had that role formally. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s a pretty sick set of statistics about this. If you look in the old Twitter feed, like three years prior to me having this role, the percentage of speakers at Python who were women was one percent, and then it was 5%, and then it was 10%. When formalized, and I was investing time in and getting other people to invest time in, it was 15 %, and then it was 33%. By the time this project launches, that number will increase to 41%, which is insanely high for a very prestigious open source conference. This is a conference with a highly competitive and actually mostly blind selection process, so this is a pure top of the funnel investment with real payoff. </span></p>\n<p><b>You&#8217;ve engineered a system that was successful in increasing diversity in this specific culture. What are the things that have worked and what are the roadblocks that you see that make it tougher to replicate across all tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I should caveat the whole prior discussion with the fact that gender is not the only demographic that matters. Gender happens to be relatively easy to measure, in a way that&#8217;s not super creepy, and track over time. Women are half the population. It&#8217;s a very obvious needle to move. Let&#8217;s pretend that we wish there were more women in engineering in our company. It can be women, or it can be any other demographic that you&#8217;re trying to optimize for. Here&#8217;s the process: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step zero: it has to actually be a place where people want to work. For example, it has to be a place that equitably retains and promotes women. There&#8217;s no point worrying about and investing a bunch of time in the hiring process if once people join, there they&#8217;re going to be unhappy and they&#8217;re going to quit. That&#8217;s step zero. You have to measure this stuff or you won’t know if you&#8217;re doing a good job. Do that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step one: You have to have an equitable evaluation pipeline.You&#8217;re the only one who&#8217;s measuring it, so you need to measure segments broken down by the demographics that you care about. If your evaluation process is fair, and has equitable outcomes, this will stabilize across the demographics that you care about. There&#8217;s a standard pipeline analysis for this, which is like your pre-onset to onset, and your onset to offer, offer to offer accept. You have to ensure that whole process is equitable.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;If all it is a math problem, what it really is, then is just a prioritization question because anybody can do the math. It&#8217;s a question for you as the head of a company, what is the appropriate way to prioritize this problem? If your company is running out of money tomorrow and has a bunch of other problems, maybe this isn&#8217;t the thing that you need to be paying attention too. But I suspect if you want to be a company that&#8217;s around for the long haul and you want to attract the best talents and retain it, you probably have to care about this whether you like it or not because people like me are going to opt out of working at your company if you don&#8217;t make it a priority.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The beauty of this is that when you achieve steps zero and one, it becomes a numbers game. You have to pass through raids on an evaluation pipeline that is equitable and dumps candidates into an environment that is equitable, all you have to do then is have some outcomes that you want, back up the math on that and that&#8217;s a set of top of funnel targets that your job. Your job is to incentivize a diverse top of the funnel that will cause the math to happen from the pipeline that has those outcomes. That&#8217;s all it is. It is just a math problem. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If all it is a math problem, what it really is, then is just a prioritization question because anybody can do the math. It&#8217;s a question for you as the head of a company, what is the appropriate way to prioritize this problem? If your company is running out of money tomorrow and has a bunch of other problems, maybe this isn&#8217;t the thing that you need to be paying attention too. But I suspect if you want to be a company that&#8217;s around for the long haul and you want to attract the best talents and retain it, you probably have to care about this whether you like it or not because people like me are going to opt out of working at your company if you don&#8217;t make it a priority. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, it&#8217;s a prioritization question, so you make sure that it&#8217;s staffed appropriately with recruiting and with event coordinators and it&#8217;s incentivized appropriately with your hiring managers and with recruiting. Then you just do it. Any company that says that they care about this, in particular, if you&#8217;re going to write a blog post about it or something where you&#8217;re going to say that you care about it and then you report back next year that nothing has changed, you don&#8217;t have to make up a crazy story about it. You just didn&#8217;t prioritize it sufficiently. Just own that. It&#8217;s your decision to make and you can evaluate the pros and cons, but that&#8217;s all it is. It was a prioritization decision. Once you have an inclusive culture, it will make for an equitable pipeline and a properly incentivized top of the funnel and that&#8217;s all there is to it. So, simple, right? How do people screw this up?</span></p>\n<p><b>Well, it&#8217;s funny hearing just the very first step and making it—even just for tension it&#8217;s just starting to be talked about. It&#8217;s crazy.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If that sounded depressing, the good news is that I think that it has become something that people have to care about and it will just naturally become a thing that accompanies our better add over time. Enough people are going to be doing this. Kids these days who are going to  graduated from college soon. They&#8217;re going to enter into a work force, or they&#8217;re not even going to realize that it used to be difficult to get engineering teams to talk about why this was a thing they should care about. It&#8217;s a different scene these days. That&#8217;s extremely encouraging. We should be vigilant about this stuff. It&#8217;s easy to regress, but I&#8217;m pretty optimistic.</span></p>\n<p><b>Do you feel the inclination to apply your knowledge, and what you&#8217;ve learned, and your experience, into different specific niches of tech after this? After Python?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That question is, what do I actually care about in life, which is a totally different question, although we could talk about that, if you want.</span></p>\n<p><b>We can talk about that.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am not strongly motivated by being in an engineering leadership position at a tech company. I appear to be pretty good at it, which is why I keep doing it, and then keep getting into increasingly large levels of responsibility for it. I really like people. I really like surrounding myself with the types of people that you find  in these organizations. There are other things that I actually care about in life and I would expect that in the arch of my adult life and I will move into a pretty different role over time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Things that I care about include—they&#8217;re going to all sound related. Things that I care about include the democratic machine, like democracy as an institution mostly in the United States. I care about education. I care about journalism. And then I care about the power of media more broadly to educate and influence people. These things are all related. You need an aware and educated population that is able to work together in a democratic society to move each other forward. That&#8217;s how it&#8217;s all related.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of these things, one property that&#8217;s really nice about being in a software company or being in software, is the scale. You can write software that you continually distribute to everybody, to hundreds of millions of people if you want. That is incredibly powerful and once you have a taste of doing that, it can be difficult to do work that scales less. For example, it is difficult to visualize myself being a teacher in a classroom. Maybe if I&#8217;m a teacher in a classroom that is on the  internet and reaches lots and lots of people, maybe that&#8217;s appealing. Or if I&#8217;m helping to drive policy decisions that impact many, many people, that&#8217;s appealing. It&#8217;s finding the impact at scale in these fields that I&#8217;m pretty passionate about in a way that parallels the opportunities scale that you can have in software. Those are things I actually care about. </span></p>\n<p><b>Why have you been working in tech companies and for a while if it&#8217;s not really what you care about? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve learned that it&#8217;s been intentional. I&#8217;ve learned a bunch of highly transferable skills building companies and managing increasingly complex organizations.I wouldn&#8217;t go back and undo it. I will eventually, over the course of my life, move into something that&#8217;s more differently related to one of these four topics that I mentioned. A change from holding a leadership position in a pure tech company.</span></p>\n<p><b>On that note, I&#8217;m curious about your high-level thoughts on the state of tech in 2016, and what excites you, specifically the potential of tech&#8217;s applications to those things that you care about.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s a good question. I mean some of these things are a little obvious, and if I were better predicting the non-obvious things, like maybe I should be a VC and just cash a bunch of checks, ha! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m a pretty avid Twitter user.  When I watch grassroots political movements on Twitter that&#8217;s exciting to me. The internet is amazing. It connects people independent of distance. That&#8217;s why the internet is the greatest invention of all time, and I&#8217;m a little bit obsessed with it. There is also the infrastructure of the internet, we could go off on a whole weird tangent about that. That&#8217;s exciting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To follow up on that, that was a lot of the stuff that I think is the biggest set of issues isn&#8217;t going to get solved. Sometimes the solution isn&#8217;t technological. There will be technological platforms that will enable the people who are going to cause the change to do it, but at the end of the day the thing that&#8217;s going to make a difference. Problems like fulfilling the promise of a equitable  public education in the U.S. is not going to be solved by technology. I don&#8217;t think it is—I could be wrong. Sorry to any ed-tech people who end up reading this. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t think like a piece of software is going to solve that problem. It&#8217;s going to be the policies and the institutional infrastructure around people that we change that solves it. Which is part of why I probably won&#8217;t be building the software for very long. I&#8217;m going to be more directly in the sector with the people who are making the change. Probably.</span></p>\n<p><b>Do you have feelings about technology influencing the rate at which policy can be changed?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You would hope that it makes it faster. If you could vote from your phone, or a computer, that&#8217;d be pretty great. The place that I just was before I was here, I was just in Buenos Aires, and they have compulsory voting. Because you have a bunch of people who vote because they have to, and they don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on. There are pros and cons to compulsory voting. It&#8217;s too bad that the engagement is so low in the U.S., but if we could make it easier to vote, that&#8217;d be pretty sweet. Although in this election, I think that we&#8217;re going to have better turnout than ever before. It’s a crazy time.</span></p>\n<p><b>What is frustrating to you about tech in its current state, and what would you like to see change?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think it&#8217;s bad that in the US there is a monopoly on this sort of startup ecosystem and culture. Really the only game in town is Silicon Valley, and I&#8217;m sort of a walking example of this. I was in Boston, started two tech companies in Boston and even we succumbed to the pull of Silicon Valley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s because money is better out here. The tech companies who are going to acquire you are going to pay bigger premiums out west. The talent&#8217;s all out here. The network is out here. And that&#8217;s bad. What do we learn in history about monopolies? Like, monopolies are—in the long run they&#8217;re bad for innovation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would love to see truly competitive alternative to Silicon Valley in the United States. I would love to see competition that it&#8217;s a healthier culture, and maybe promotes people being willing to invest in ideas deeply, for a long time. Really bringing expertise in a domain to solving real problems in the world, as opposed to just building apps. That is my fantasy is that 20 years from now. </span></p>\n<p><b>From all of your experiences, having not worked only in Silicon Valley proper, being a female developer, doing tons of diversity work, I would just be curious to hear your general thoughts right now on the state of diversity in tech. Aside from the system that can fix it, or even the high-level roadblocks you&#8217;ve seen.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you look at the research, the data tells us that there&#8217;s a leaky pipeline and that diversity for women in industry as compared to graduation rates is still trailing behind and it&#8217;s a much worse story for other demographics. If we wanted to pick on ethnic demographics, the story for African-Americans and Hispanics is much worse. That sucks! I don&#8217;t want to be in a different industry though.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do we even care that the tech industry be reflective of the population that it serves? It has such a profound ability to change people&#8217;s lives if we do it the right way. I personally wouldn&#8217;t want to leave because of the shitty pipeline issues that I&#8217;d rather fight, but not everybody has the luxury of being able to do that. I mean, the trends are weird, right? The trends for women in CS were going down for a really long time. My understanding is that they&#8217;re back on the upswing, but the peak was decades ago, and we have a lot of ground to recover. I feel like there&#8217;s a lot of work to do, but that&#8217;s work worth doing.</span></p>\n<p><b>I keep going back to the story you shared of having such a positive first experience in shipping that patch to the open source project.</b> <b>I wonder how massively important those first experiences are, and whether they&#8217;re positive or negative.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hugely.</span></p>\n<p><b>—and whether or not that turns a person into a incredibly high contributor vs someone who eventually leaves the industry.</b></p>\n<p>Anyone in data tells us that it&#8217;s usually important. It doesn&#8217;t even have to be anecdotal, I think we just know from the data.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is related to some of the things we&#8217;ve talked about, but it&#8217;s worth saying. I get asked quite a bit why I spend a bunch of time on outreach in Tech, and the real actual reason for this is different from what people would expect. I believe we will build better products if the people who are developing these products are a  reflection of the population that we are serving. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s the right thing to do. I want any kids that I have to feel like they can do anything in the world. Those are all the reasons why, and I believe that it is important that people have access to programing.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Learning how to program allows you to develop the confidence that you can learn how to operate within a system and to deconstruct it and to tear it down to make it better.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not everybody has to be a programmer but let them always have the opportunity to try it out. It is the first time that you can become fluent in a system, so that you understand that you can change it and that lesson that everything in the world is a system that can be understood and deconstructed and changed in that way. I think many people probably never have had the luxury to navel gaze about this stuff. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learning how to program allows you to develop the confidence that you can learn how to operate within a system and to deconstruct it and to tear it down to make it better. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowing how to do that and have confidence in that as a programmer is already very powerful because when you know how to program you can create all of these amazing things in the world. The more important lesson there is that you have gained—you have had this experience of observing a system and believing that you can change it. And that&#8217;s the thing that I actually want everybody on the planet to experience because there are many systems, and some of these systems are software systems, but probably the most important ones are people systems, and it&#8217;s not actually any different.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everything is a system that you can understand, and you can deconstruct, and you can break down, and you can change.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everything is a system that you can understand, and you can deconstruct, and you can break down, and you can change.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> That is the thing that I actually want everybody to experience. That is why I spend all of my time—or a bunch of time—teaching beginners of diverse backgrounds how to program, because that is maybe the most profound thing that I&#8217;ve ever experienced, and maybe one of the more profound things that many, many people in the world can experience if they have a chance to do so. </span></p>\n<p><b>What advice would you give to folks who hope to get into programming or are just getting started?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m a lot more confident now than when I was when I was 18.I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a way to short circuit that. I don’t know if there&#8217;s a world where anybody can tell you like believe in yourself, have the confidence. I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any way to learn that through experience but it makes such a big difference. Given my experiences in college, feeling like I had to work harder than all of my peers who&#8217;d been doing this for a lot longer than me, and later to get to the point where I could prove myself to them and validate that I was as good as everyone else like a big validation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By having the confidence to dive into that and to totally believe people actually thought I was good wasn’t simple. It was like an imposter syndrome. The side issue I want you to learn about is imposter syndrome. It actually makes material impact in your life. This is one of those beautiful things that you realize that if you put into it you could reflect on it could actually change your behavior. I think that&#8217;s how I would summarize it. If I had known about it when I was 16 or 18, that would have been helpful.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

I&#8217;m from the St. Louis, Missouri area. Technically I&#8217;m from southern Illinois, but when I say Illinois, people think Chicago, which is like six hours north of Shiloh, Illinois, where I&#8217;m from. I lived there from kindergarten until I graduated from high school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was always a shy kid—soft spoken, quiet, very much a bookworm. I was also into video games from an early age thanks to my dad’s influence. I also really liked the internet because it was this new, shiny thing. In Belleville, most people are like-minded—so because the Internet has so many subcultures,  I felt like I could finally find my place. I eventually taught myself how to code, HTML and CSS to start, and how to create graphics. I made random websites based on stuff I was interested in; I think I made my first website in 6th grade. It was on Geocities [laughter]. I kept doing it throughout high school and it morphed into my passion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After high school, I went to a small school called Maryville University in St. Louis, thinking like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be a web designer for a living, that&#8217;s a thing people do I guess?&#8221; But my school didn&#8217;t actually have much for web design. I told them I wanted to major in web design, but they&#8217;re like &#8220;uh, we don&#8217;t have that, what are you talking about?&#8221; They did have very small graphic design program, so I decided to major in that.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The summer before my sophomore year, my dad got laid off so my parents couldn&#8217;t help me with school anymore. I had a decent scholarship based on my strong academics from high school, but my university was so expensive that I couldn&#8217;t afford the rest of the tuition. The school wouldn’t let me continue until I paid back what owed from my freshman year, so I left school and got two jobs: first at Build a Bear and the Apple Store, and then Apple and a waitressing job.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The summer before my sophomore year, my dad got laid off so my parents couldn&#8217;t help me with school anymore. I had a decent scholarship based on my strong academics from high school, but my university was so expensive that I couldn&#8217;t afford the rest of the tuition. The school wouldn’t let me continue until I paid back what owed from my freshman year, so I left school and got two jobs: first at Build a Bear and the Apple Store, and then Apple and a waitressing job. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was thinking, &#8220;well, I&#8217;ll work on paying them back and just figure it out as I go.&#8221; After about 2 years of working while taking a few community college classes, I finally paid back the freshman year debt. But by then I was so disillusioned with Maryville University and the Midwest in general that I was like, &#8220;well, I&#8217;m moving to California now.&#8221; So I went online and searched for design programs in California. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I found a school in San Francisco and I got interested in their animation program. Suddenly I was like &#8220;well now I&#8217;m going to be an animator.&#8221; So I saved up, transferred Apple stores, and moved to San Francisco to attend the Art Institute of California (AI). Eventually I figured out that animation wasn’t a great fit for me. I love to watch animation, but I didn&#8217;t enjoy the process of making it and the school was extremely expensive. But by that point I was already kind of in love with San Francisco. I&#8217;d been here about a year, so I was like, well I may not be going to school there anymore, but I have to figure out how I can stay here. So I left AI, then I went on Craigslist and found a second job, working as an office assistant at a startup called Socialcast in SOMA. I  eventually let them know I was into design and that I could code, so they allowed me to take on some small projects for the company while I worked as an office assistant. When my boss went on maternity leave, I quit my job at Apple and went to Socialcast full time, which kind of started me on this tech path.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Learning how to code was very tedious for me [chuckles]. I had to follow so many tutorials. I also feel like I&#8217;m always comparing myself to developers I meet here who are extremely talented. Sometimes I don&#8217;t even want to call myself a coder or developer compared to them. I&#8217;m a designer who can code. That&#8217;s an important distinction to me.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>What was the experience like for you, teaching yourself to design and code?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It partially goes on instinct. </span>I&#8217;ve always be attracted to visual endeavors; I&#8217;ve been drawing, painting, and things like that since I was in junior high. So I feel like design is very similar to where it really helps if you some natural instinct for things like handling visuals and being empathetic to users, but there are also many things you have to be taught. As for coding, there’s more effort involved for me. I enjoy it, but I sometimes struggle with the logic behind it. Learning how to code was very tedious for me [chuckles]. I had to follow so many tutorials. I also feel like I&#8217;m always comparing myself to developers I meet here who are extremely talented. Sometimes I don&#8217;t even want to call myself a coder or developer compared to them. I&#8217;m a designer who can code. That&#8217;s an important distinction to me. Learning how to code was challenging, but learning how to design has been fun because it&#8217;s about reading people&#8217;s emotions, designing interactions and visuals, and things like that. And I am always learning. I&#8217;ve never had a full formal design education. It&#8217;s mostly been on the job experience. Since that&#8217;s something I&#8217;m aware of, I always try to keep reading and learning.</p>\n<p><b>Tell me a little bit more about your work and things that you&#8217;re proud of—things that really excite you about your work.</b></p>\n<p>One thing I&#8217;m a big advocate for in my work is thinking outside the typical mold that tech people in Silicon valley seem to be designing for. Even in the most subtle ways, so many people are designing for users who are in demographics that are similar to themselves or other people in their “bubble.” By default, they are designing for someone who looks like them. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And most designers in San Francisco are white guys, with some white girls mixed in here and there. So I&#8217;m often the person chiming in with things like &#8220;Wait why do all of the avatars have that kind of hair? Not everyone has that texture. Why are all the hands holding the mobile devices in these photo white&#8221; And I know details like that are such a non-issue for some people, but because I notice it I like to challenge other designers on it when I can. </span>Lately I&#8217;m reading up on things like how to design for those with disabilities, like design for people with hearing or visual disabilities. So that&#8217;s kind of the thing I really get excited about, just thinking about audiences that aren&#8217;t as focused on.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;One thing I&#8217;m a big advocate for in my work is thinking outside the typical mold that tech people in Silicon valley seem to be designing for.

I think I saw a movie when I was in junior high, Pirates of Silicon Valley? I really never saw myself having anything to do with it—I didn&#8217;t correlate my nerdy hobbies like web design to be related to tech. And then when I got the job at Socialcast, it was still all so new to me. There were only like 10 to 15 people in the office at the time, and I didn&#8217;t even know what a startup was. I was coming in thinking like, &#8220;Ok, I need something that&#8217;s going to pay my bills—that&#8217;s all I care about.&#8221; But when I got hired they were starting a round of funding, so I was being thrown into this fast paced startup world. And at the same time, I was still working part time at the Apple Store. So</span> it was very different, being an hourly retail employee going into a startup world. I had no idea of what to expect but what I learned very quickly is there&#8217;s a lot of really smart people working really hard on something, and everyone&#8217;s really passionate. So that was kind of cool because that&#8217;s the kind of work ethic that I personally admire. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I was like, &#8220;Okay, so much is happening here.&#8221; So I didn&#8217;t know what I was witnessing when I first moved here, and in retrospect I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Man, I should have met more people and networked and all that!&#8221; But also, I&#8217;m terrible at networking, but it was still cool though to be a part of it.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I would definitely say a sense of isolation. It’s a little due to my own personal insecurities because I haven&#8217;t finished school, but on top of that, it’s hard when no one looks like you or can relate to struggles you may have.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>What have been some of the tougher parts about working in tech for you?</b></p>\n<p class=\"body_text\">I would definitely say a sense of isolation. It’s a little due to my own personal insecurities because I haven&#8217;t finished school, but on top of that, it’s hard when no one looks like you or can relate to struggles you may have. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s been a challenge for me lately, especially now that I&#8217;m getting older and really wanting to explore and embrace my ethnicity. I actually did a 23andme genealogy test like two years ago to learn about my heritage and ethnicity because there&#8217;s a lot of holes in my family tree and I just had this feeling of wanting to define who I am, ethnically. </span>Lately I&#8217;m feeling much more aware of what it means to be a Black woman than I have been ever before. I&#8217;m finally confident in proudly declaring that I&#8217;m a Black woman, but I work in an industry where I feel like I can&#8217;t let that pride be known because I don&#8217;t want to make a lot of people uncomfortable. So it&#8217;s kind of like a weird double act where outside of work, I feel very “woke” or aware of social justice and civil rights issues affecting Black Americans and other minority groups, but then at work that side of me never comes out because I’m scared that it&#8217;s not appropriate. And then I feel so frustrated that I&#8217;m even having this internal struggle where I’m so concerned about making other people uncomfortable.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"body_text\">&#8220;Lately I&#8217;m feeling much more aware of what it means to be a Black woman than I have been ever before. I&#8217;m finally confident in proudly declaring that I&#8217;m a Black woman, but I work in an industry where I feel like I can&#8217;t let that pride be known because I don&#8217;t want to make a lot of people uncomfortable.

And then I feel so frustrated that I&#8217;m even having this internal struggle where I’m so concerned about making other people uncomfortable.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t help that I have had these awkward conversations where people just don&#8217;t know or care that I identify as Black so they feel comfortable saying really ridiculous or ignorant things. Like once I was in Lyft and the driver talking about Ferguson because I mentioned I&#8217;m from St. Louis. It was right around the protests that happened after Mike Brown was shot and he was totally ragging on protesters, and just being very insulting and condescending to the community as a whole. I remember thinking &#8220;Wow, would he say all of that to me if I had visibly darker skin?”<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Would he be comfortable saying, “These people are rioting like animals”&#8217; or whatever he said. I think the answer is no, he wouldn’t have. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And so that’s the worry I have—although someone may seem like a great person overall, they&#8217;ll have some beliefs may be really different than mine when it comes down to it and I don&#8217;t want to cause problems at work or networking as a result. </span>I don&#8217;t want to make people feel uncomfortable or exclude them from my life due to difference of opinion, but to me there are some ways of thinking that I can’t accept because they actively hurt people. So I end up compromising my beliefs and tolerating things that I know I shouldn&#8217;t. In the past, I would just nervously laugh along with jokes and smile when on the inside I don&#8217;t agree. Lately, in the last year or so, I&#8217;m trying harder to tactfully call people out, but it&#8217;s quite hard to do sometimes.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to make people feel uncomfortable or exclude them from my life due to difference of opinion, but to me there are some ways of thinking that I can’t accept because they actively hurt people.

I didn&#8217;t even rate him badly. I just was like, &#8220;Oh, he was really nice before we talked about Ferguson, and he obviously has no idea what he was talking about.&#8221; I still gave him 5 stars. I basically give everyone a 5 star, but after that, it haunted me for weeks. I feel like </span>Tiffany today would not have been so meek, but back then I was still so mousy about issues of race and politics. I just didn&#8217;t want to talk about it, because ignoring microaggressions is what has helped me thrive in college and in my career.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And I don’t want to sound like I think I some perfect person who gets it right each time. </span>Honestly, in the past I used to think most race issues didn&#8217;t affect me. But because I have a younger brother, I see him in all of these young black and brown men being targeted by police brutality or the justice system. So that helped wake me up, because my family isn&#8217;t totally protected from the effects of institutional racism just because we have lighter skin. It could happen to me too. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And at the same time, me finally realizing that social justice issues directly affect me or those I care about shouldn&#8217;t have been what made me finally pay attention to systematic inequalities. So now I occasionally feel guilty for judging people who are ignorant about civil rights issues because I was still quite naive seven years ago when I first moved here.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Honestly, in the past I used to think most race issues didn&#8217;t affect me.

I feel like it all of of this racial tension needs to come up to the surface so people can talk about it. While we may never be able to end racism, we can start acknowledging and addressing the systemic issues and begin to move forward.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Because I think when Barack Obama got elected, people were like, &#8220;Well, racism is over!&#8221; I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s been quite the case [chuckles]. It&#8217;s been a very weird thing to witness on the activism I&#8217;m seeing online and offline elsewhere versus what I&#8217;m witnessing in my real life.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, it&#8217;s so interesting. Have you found support networks here yet?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have, and I haven&#8217;t. I follow lots of different social justice accounts on Tumblr and Twitter, where people can share their own personal stories or report on different situations happening across the globe. It’s nice to find a connection through other people&#8217;s experiences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The one support group I have found that is local is online, a Bay Area “Women of Color in Tech” group. It&#8217;s nice to have a place where other women of color will listen to my concerns and validate my feelings. So I have found a support group in that sense, but I haven&#8217;t actually made any friends in the group. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have friends in the Bay Area that are designers of course—other women designers and other women of color designers—mostly Asian women. And while I&#8217;m sure we could discuss the hardships of being a woman in tech, I don&#8217;t think I could approach them about issues concerning race or anti-blackness. I don&#8217;t know if they will feel comfortable talking about it, and honestly I also don&#8217;t know how much they would care. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d find any support in my professional network. So that&#8217;s something I do think is missing, that solidarity.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Bay Area is more diverse overall than my hometown, but seeing black and brown faces is so rare in tech. One of my friends from grade school had a work trip here recently, we met to catch up and talk about work and life in general. It was so nice just vibing with her. Because I hadn&#8217;t done that ever, really— talking about professional issues as a black woman with another black woman. She isn&#8217;t a designer—she works in economics. But it was still nice to have that moment.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Bay Area is more diverse overall than my hometown, but seeing black and brown faces is so rare in tech.

But it was still nice to have that moment.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I wish I could discuss social justice issues more and talk about these things openly, instead of me being complacent and pretending that race isn&#8217;t the issue. Unless I&#8217;m on Tumblr, and then I feel okay publicly acknowledging that it&#8217;s an issue [chuckles].</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. You mentioned in your pre-interview that you hadn&#8217;t met another black woman designer in your six years here in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. </span>I feel like I&#8217;ve met maybe one or two in passing, but I&#8217;ve definitely never worked with or had a friendship with another black woman designer. Obviously I don&#8217;t want to be friends with someone just because we have a similar ethnic background—that&#8217;s shallow. But it does make me sad to knowing I have no black designer friends—male or female. That&#8217;s weird to me. I know there&#8217;s black women designers out there. There has to be. But where are they? If there are no black women designing the apps and sites that so many people use, then that voice isn&#8217;t being presented or considered in the design. Are things being designed with black women in mind? Or Latina or Hispanic women? I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t think so.</p>\n<p><b>Do you feel like you have role models that you can look up to?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t have any black woman designers, but I do have other female designers as role models, for sure. Actually, one of my personal designer role models is one of my really good friends. She&#8217;s an amazing designer and an even better person. She&#8217;s also a woman of color too. I used to work with her at my last job. Once she left, I realized how wonderful it is to have a friend and mentor at work. Not only does she mentor me in design, but I’ve learned so much from her about workplace politics. I&#8217;ve witnessed people discriminate against her. I don&#8217;t know how much of it was race related, perhaps some of it was, but working with her I saw what it looks like when men are threatened by strong women. Confident and smart women taking taking leadership positions threatens some men, and I witnessed that happen. And it was unfortunate, but she handled it with such grace, elegance, and perseverance. I&#8217;m glad that I have someone that I can turn to not only for career and design advice, but also for help in navigating the realities of being a minority and a woman in the design world. She&#8217;s definitely someone I can go to when I feel like I&#8217;m lost. </span></p>\n<p><b>You touched on this and you mentioned in your pre-interview that you&#8217;ve had some really unique experiences as a pale black person.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes I think that non-black people don&#8217;t really know what I am, which used to actually really surprise me. I never thought of myself as being racially ambiguous until I got to college. My school wasn’t diverse and I started getting the “what are you?” questions. Right now I have braids, I think maybe that helps. People are like “oh ok, well, she&#8217;s something…” but when I first moved here I used to straighten my hair. A common question I get is if I am part Japanese, which is amusing to me because I have 0% East Asian genetics. I just happen to love studying the language.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But from time to time, I’ll hear comments from people or they do things like casually quote a song and use the n-word, I&#8217;m just like “whoa, would you have been as comfortable saying that if I had darker skin?” I don&#8217;t think they would. Like you wouldn&#8217;t have said that if I had the same skin tone as my dad, who matches the visible spectrum of what non-black people perceive as being black. So I think sometimes people feel like more comfortable saying things that are not appropriate around me, but on the flip side I think that it&#8217;s kind of up to me to say something. But that&#8217;s also much pressure! I&#8217;m naturally not a combative or antagonistic person, but even when I&#8217;ve spoken up in the past, people are like “Oh, what are you mixed with?” So it&#8217;s always really awkward. But I&#8217;ve always felt like I have had to prove my blackness. So even today, I find myself being like “Stereotypes are gross but of course I can dance, of course I can cook soul food.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an adult, I have wondered how many other black people think about this stuff, but I don&#8217;t have a network of people talk about it with in the Bay Area. Growing up, I really never talked about race like this. The St. Louis area is very segregated. It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re black or you&#8217;re white—even non-black people of color seemed to “pick a side,” if you will. And I liked things that black people weren&#8217;t supposed to like, like computers, video games, and anime. I took advanced classes in junior high and high school where there were only a handful of black kids, in a school that was like 50% black. And then I had this super light skin, eyes, and hair that somehow made me a target for some black kid bullies, saying I stuff like I wasn&#8217;t even an Oreo (an insult saying someone is black on the outside, white on the inside), that I was just an other. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, by the time I started college, I was perfectly happy being like “fine, they don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m black, whatever. I&#8217;m just my own thing.” Which was so weird, because my dad is Black, and my mom is technically mixed with White but identifies as Black. So at home, I was Black but at school I felt too intimidated to say I was Black. So that&#8217;s why I think I&#8217;ve had this epiphany in the last few years where I&#8217;m like, no I am Black too. The 23andme test was like the final bit of ammo I needed. I&#8217;m 68% African. I may be mixed with other things, but that is my proof. It&#8217;s what made feel like I can claim my blackness, even though I&#8217;m on the lighter side of the spectrum of American Blackness.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I feel like I&#8217;ve met maybe one or two in passing, but I&#8217;ve definitely never worked with or had a friendship with another black woman designer. Obviously I don&#8217;t want to be friends with someone just because we have a similar ethnic background—that&#8217;s shallow. But it does make me sad to knowing I have no black designer friends—male or female. That&#8217;s weird to me. I know there&#8217;s black women designers out there. There has to be. But where are they? If there are no black women designing the apps and sites that so many people use, then that voice isn&#8217;t being presented or considered in the design. Are things being designed with black women in mind? Or Latina or Hispanic women? I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know my friends and even family aren&#8217;t aware of these internal identity struggles I have. So, I know sometimes I&#8217;m more sensitive about making people accept that I am a valid form of Blackness. Which sounds really weird because at the same time if you talked to me ten years ago I would be like, “No, I&#8217;m not black. Black people don&#8217;t accept me and so I don&#8217;t accept them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And I know I don’t face the same level of discrimination that comes with darker skin. I also know that light skin privilege exists. I feel like I&#8217;m in a very interesting place today and definitely this is like—I&#8217;ve never even talked about this with anybody like before. I feel so comfortable discussing this with you [chuckles], but now that you asked that question, all of the feelings that I had before about how I never really felt like I could proudly say that I&#8217;m a black person. But now, I do feel like that and sometimes I&#8217;m almost like beating that fact over people’s heads because I&#8217;m finally like comfortable saying that. But, that&#8217;s only around friends. When it comes to work, I don&#8217;t really like to talk about race because like I said, I&#8217;m always worried about the reaction I’ll get.</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;ve talked a lot with people about how like the way that they grew up and how it impacts like how they are in work environments and stuff like that. For some people, it manifests in now wanting to like minimize conflict and that sort of thing. So I&#8217;m curious how like you&#8217;re upbringing you think affects like how you deal with stuff in the workplace.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would agree with that for sure. I think people from the Midwest tend to like be really nice up front, because that&#8217;s just how you&#8217;re supposed to be—neighborly and super accommodating. And so I definitely have that quality, but even in my own home growing up, I was always the very quiet one. But that said, I feel like as I&#8217;m getting older, finding my voice, and becoming more comfortable in myself, I definitely am getting better at speaking out when I don&#8217;t like something. But I do sometimes catch people off guard when I don&#8217;t like something because I usually am so easygoing. I naturally want people to get along and want there to be harmony and balance. But when I do have to confront someone over something I have to psyche myself into it. Like I said about the Lyft driver guy, like I could have passively given him a bad review, but I still felt bad doing that. I was thinking “Oh but he has a hard job too and maybe he had a bad day.”</span></p>\n<p><b>I have a very similar temperament. I’m just now learning to stand up for myself too—not letting everything slide.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s my biggest thing. I&#8217;ve always struggled with microaggressions, even before I knew what they were called. They have happened to me my whole life and I have typically just let them slide. I felt like at some point, I&#8217;d eventually reach a breaking point over it so that&#8217;s why I felt I had to get better at not letting them go. But standing up for myself—even if it&#8217;s not confronting someone in the moment—that&#8217;s my personal goal is to be able to do that.</span></p>\n<p><b>I honestly still can&#8217;t.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s hard. One of my current goals is to, especially with someone I care about, is to call them out on it if they say something that isn&#8217;t cool. For all scenarios, even when it&#8217;s not something that directly relates to me. Especially in work situations, where I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;m cool with you and we&#8217;re friends, but you can&#8217;t say that kind of stuff about women or make jokes about someone&#8217;s body or sexuality or anything like that.&#8221; Being in the Bay Area, sometimes I feel like I&#8217;m working with a lot of immature man children. Like a designer I worked with compared an Asian interview subject, specifically her voice and laugh, to a yellowface character from a sketch tv show. This was during an interview round table session, in front of other senior people and the recruiter. No one said anything. Like, he was a senior team member and he was openly making jokes like that. I wish I had said something, you know? When I think back to stuff like that I always feel a kind of pang of regret, like &#8220;I should have said something.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><b>Based on all of your experiences, what would you look for in a future job?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s something I&#8217;m thinking about a lot now. I have separate buckets of criteria for what I&#8217;m looking for in future roles. Like is it a job where the product is  making a difference in people&#8217;s lives, helping somehow? Is it a job where I am being fulfilled personally? Is the team diverse? So far, the jobs I&#8217;ve had have been really good for personal growth and career growth, but they haven&#8217;t matched the other criteria as much. And for the second criteria bucket, for a future job I definitely would love to do something related to like my hobbies or interests. Like I have been studying Japanese for almost a decade now. So I would love to do something with Japanese in my career so it feels like it&#8217;s not just a hobby and something that I&#8217;m actually using everyday. </span></p>\n<p><b>How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? What really excites you? What frustrates you?</b></p>\n<p class=\"body_text\">I think what&#8217;s really exciting is that the things we work on in tech are so normal for everyone, even those outside of the tech world now. Actually, I just got back from Bahrain last week. My friend is from there and I went for her wedding. In Bahrain, Instagram was everywhere. And it was so crazy think that this product that was originally created by a small team in the same city where I live is touching so many people&#8217;s lives across the world. Like storefronts had their Instagram names on the sign below the store’s name, like that&#8217;s how big it is there.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what scares or frustrates me is like stuff like bullying, or how tech can give hatred such a prominent platform.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Diversity and inclusion just isn&#8217;t a concern for most people in tech. For example, if you&#8217;re happy and comfortable with your design team being homogenous, then you&#8217;re probably not going to feel challenged to make it diverse unless somebody points out, &#8216;Hey, this is a problem.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, it seems that now people are getting so hung up on online relationships that they don&#8217;t know how to have offline relationships anymore. I just watched Master of None and all those things he&#8217;s talking about are things that I am witnessing friends go through. Like people don&#8217;t know how to have relationships. They&#8217;re so worried because there&#8217;s like 5,000 people they can date via an app. They don&#8217;t want to settle and things like that. So that kind of scares me… And I&#8217;m a technology optimist.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of people are scared of the Big Brotherness Google a lot, but I&#8217;m the person who&#8217;s like, &#8220;Google, take my data. You help me get to meetings on time; you help me not get lost. You can have all my data.&#8221; But I&#8217;m always a little worried that the era of optimism and innocence with the Internet is gone. People are more nefarious and don&#8217;t have the best intentions with your data out there. So that&#8217;s another thing I think is really big for tech right now is security. Now that the internet is more mature, we&#8217;re starting to really see more standards now. From a product development standpoint, maybe you can&#8217;t move fast and break things—to quote Facebook—but now users are more aware about their data. So you have to spend more time making sure your product is safe and compliant. So I think it&#8217;s nice that we are self-regulating things, but I don&#8217;t want tech to get too regulated. The Internet has always been a special place with unlimited creativity. Overall, tech is very exciting right now. So that&#8217;s kind of the cool part, witnessing it all. </span></p>\n<p><b>How do you think tech can be more accommodating to diverse perspectives in design?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s something that I think about a lot. I really think it goes down to getting people involved early. I&#8217;ve met people here who have a lot of privilege, but they don&#8217;t realize it. And it&#8217;s very much a buddy system in tech where one person gets into a company, and then they only refer their friends and others in the social bubble. And because they don&#8217;t have a diverse friend group, the company’s demographics become very uniformed. Many people seem threatened by the idea of forcing diversity, but I think it is good to have someone at an executive level who is tasked with increasing diversity and making workplaces inclusive to all kinds of people. </span></p>\n<p>Diversity and inclusion just isn&#8217;t a concern for most people in tech. For example, if you&#8217;re happy and comfortable with your design team being homogenous, then you&#8217;re probably not going to feel challenged to make it diverse unless somebody points out, &#8220;Hey, this is a problem.&#8221; <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I do feel lucky that at my current job we do have some diversity in the sense that there we have people of color on the team, and it’s mostly women. But we&#8217;re just a small company, and no one&#8217;s looking to us as a design leader in the industry compared to places like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Google. And from what I&#8217;ve seen, those teams aren&#8217;t diverse.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Black Twitter, a lot of the young people on there, they&#8217;re hilarious and amazing and I love it, but how many of the young kids participating are going to think, &#8220;I want to get a job doing something related to this?&#8221; I don&#8217;t think many are because it&#8217;s not being presented as something that they can be apart of. These platforms need to reach out early because that&#8217;s their audience right there.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">InVision just had a documentary they did I think last year or a couple of months ago, and it was like the top designers disrupters in the industry. Not one person of color was in there, I think. Maybe there one woman on the list. Stuff like that. People aren&#8217;t doing it on purpose. I think most of the people in these companies just don&#8217;t have very diverse professional and personal groups, so they likely couldn’t seek out diverse voices even if they wanted to. But if no one&#8217;s calling it out, it&#8217;s not going to change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also need to go into primary and high schools and get kids involved earlier. And not just coding—I think that introducing design as career options for underrepresented groups is important too. Because the kids—Twitter, for example. </span>Black Twitter, a lot of the young people on there, they&#8217;re hilarious and amazing and I love it, but how many of the young kids participating are going to think, &#8220;I want to get a job doing something related to this?&#8221; I don&#8217;t think many are because it&#8217;s not being presented as something that they can be apart of. These platforms need to reach out early because that&#8217;s their audience right there. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have a diverse user base, but the people creating the product aren’t, then you&#8217;re going to have some problems eventually. Tumblr had a problem, actually, awhile ago where they censored some popular tag, flagging it as not safe for work or something? I don&#8217;t remember, but it impacted a huge chunk of Tumblr&#8217;s user base. A lot of marginalized groups that feel like they can find their place or community on Tumblr, but suddenly they’re being treated different by the app developers. So now they don&#8217;t trust the app, and it&#8217;s perceived value for the user goes down. If only there had been one person, one voice on the team that could have been like, &#8220;Hey, this isn&#8217;t such a good idea.&#8221; That could have been avoided.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s why you need diverse teams. My hope is that as the internet generation grows up, we start seeing more diversity. I hope that tech becomes less of a “bro club.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I would love to stay in San Francisco for the next five years but realistically, I can’t. And I know I am speaking of a place of total privilege, as a tech worker in San Francisco. I can&#8217;t imagine how hard it was if I was still working retail or if I was working as an artist. I worry that life in San Francisco is not sustainable, so I really don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;ll be in five years.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in five or ten years?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh gosh. Well as much as I love San Francisco, it&#8217;s really different now compared to when I moved here. I moved from Lower Haight to live in the Outer Sunset by the by the beach in 2014. I love living by the beach, but we truly only moved there because it was the cheapest place to find a bigger apartment at the time. But now getting downtown for work is such a hassle. I would love the ability to live closer to downtown, but I am not comfortable with how high rents are here. </span>I would love to stay in San Francisco for the next five years but realistically, I can’t.

I’ve heard that L.A. has a “Silicon Beach,” and I know there is a “Silicon Prairie” somewhere in the Midwest, although I see myself on a coast. I just hope that wherever I am in five years, I am making user experiences that are helpful to someone.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You really have to be very self-driven because there are times where it seems that no one&#8217;s going to help you. You really do have to be self-driven, which I know can be hard, especially when you’re young. But when you&#8217;re competing with very privileged people for highly desired jobs, you can&#8217;t afford to wait around—you have to create opportunities by showing others your talents and interests.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>My last question for you would be, what advice would you have to people from similar backgrounds who are hoping to get into tech?</b></p>\n<p>You really have to be very self-driven because there are times where it seems that no one&#8217;s going to help you.

I come from a mixed-race, mixed-identity household, and that set me up for a really open view [chuckles] growing up. I&#8217;ve always been into creative things, but never really honed in on it or went to any kinds of young art schools or anything like that. </span>It was only through being diagnosed with cancer that I even discovered design or anything that I&#8217;m doing now.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It was only through being diagnosed with cancer that I even discovered design or anything that I&#8217;m doing now.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>That is wild. How old were you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was 14.</span></p>\n<p><b>Walk me through that: getting diagnosed and discovering design at the same time, how does that even work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went to the doctor after having some discomfort in my neck for a few months, and then carried on about my business like nothing was wrong. Initially, I was diagnosed with a lymph node infection, so I just went to school. </span>After a couple more days though, they retested the sample and it turned out that I had cancer—so they abruptly pulled me out of school out of nowhere. My mom was like, &#8220;We need to go to the hospital right now. Don&#8217;t worry about class. Don&#8217;t worry about any of that.&#8221; And I go there and they sit me down and say, &#8220;Hey, you have stage three Burkitt’s lymphoma. We need to start chemotherapy immediately.&#8221;</p>\n<p><b>How does a 14 year old even know what that means?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t know. I was on my way to lunch and then took the detour. So then I started chemo the next day, and it was pretty intense. I had to shave my head, I lost the rest of my hair, couldn’t keep food down—I was throwing up pretty much every day. And then one day, I was laying in the ICU—isolated because I had zero white blood cells due to treatment—and I saw the little icons to adjust the bed angle up and down. They stood out to me because I could understand them but they didn’t have any words. Maybe it was just because I wasn&#8217;t really talking to people—I was in my head a lot and I started asking myself, &#8220;What&#8217;s the thing that lets me understand what this does? Like why can I read this symbol? It&#8217;s not a hieroglyph, it&#8217;s not a word, but why do I know what it&#8217;s doing. Like what&#8217;s that magic or that secret sauce behind understanding symbols?&#8221; And then I started researching things like ISOTYPE and iconography, and then that led me down the rabbit hole of digital design and now here I am.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;After a couple more days though, they retested the sample and it turned out that I had cancer—so they abruptly pulled me out of school out of nowhere.

We need to start chemotherapy immediately.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Wow. In a similar vein, did you know that you&#8217;d end up in tech, or when did you first get intrigued by that?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working in tech kind of came as a really big surprise. The only reason I&#8217;m even working in tech is because a friend of mine who I knew, back from when I used to do graffiti in college, told me about some event that Google was holding and he said, &#8220;You should throw your hat in the ring and see if they pick you for it.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Eh, I&#8217;m not going to get picked. I don&#8217;t have any art background or I don&#8217;t really even know how to use Photoshop, but I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221; So I applied for a thing called Google +20 at the recommendation of a graffiti artist in Australia. +20 was Google’s search for a top-20 selection of emerging creatives around the world, which teamed up for a hackathon, as part of Semi-Permanent LA. I pitched them a moonshot, and I was picked for it. From that, I met a lot of great designers at Google, Maud, and from Wieden+Kennedy. That introduced me to my first set of mentors and I decided to take it seriously, and that&#8217;s how I got my start in tech.</span></p>\n<p><b>Since then, what are your proudest projects and what have been the highlights of your career?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess I’d consider my ‘career’ as starting before my first actual job in tech. There was one big challenge that I took a leap in, that was coming out of the +20 event with Google. I wanted to hold my own similar thing. I had just been introduced to the idea of moonshot thinking, and I was riding this high of like, &#8220;Nothing is impossible.&#8221; So I held a design sprint with Google on civic innovation when I was 22. Most of the mentors from the previous Google event came out to Sacramento to help me run the event. That kind of gave me the spark that I still kind of hold on to—that with enough planning and focus and determination&#8230; so far I&#8217;ve encountered nothing that&#8217;s impossible.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It is a pretty big daily struggle. I&#8217;m still going through scares about, &#8220;Oh, my God. What is this bump?&#8221; Or, &#8220;This fever&#8217;s lasted too long.&#8221; I was at a gastroenterologist yesterday getting an ultrasound and a biopsy just because it&#8217;s such an ongoing concern.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the mentors that came to the event—her name was Krista Sanders, and she was the design director at a company called <a href=\"http://www.whistle.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Whistle.</a> They make a GPS tracker for dogs. That&#8217;s where I still work now as the Sr. Visual Designer. Just getting to build that kind of trial by fire has just been one long, very drawn-out accomplishment, in my eyes.</span></p>\n<p><b>What have you felt are your biggest struggles?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think one of my biggest struggles is—and I talk pretty openly about how cancer has been the catalyst to why and how I became a designer—but </span>it is a pretty big daily struggle. I&#8217;m still going through scares about, &#8220;Oh, my God. What is this bump?&#8221; Or, &#8220;This fever&#8217;s lasted too long.&#8221; I was at a gastroenterologist yesterday getting an ultrasound and a biopsy just because it&#8217;s such an ongoing concern.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also coming from a self-taught background proved to be a huge challenge. I studied communication and mass media in college, and I took one design class once and decided to switch my major because I didn&#8217;t like how it was taught. But I found that I have to learn a lot of things really quickly when I found out I don&#8217;t know them because it wasn&#8217;t included in the self-taught curriculum of just learning Photoshop and Illustrator. T</span>here&#8217;s so much that I realize I don&#8217;t know that I have to be really agile in learning. It&#8217;s kind of an ongoing challenge, I kind of like it, but it is kind of tough at times.</p>\n<p><b>Yeah. You had a freelance time in your career, right?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going through college, one of the ways I made a living was doing commissioned artwork and freelance design. I met some interesting characters throughout the freelancing [laughter].</span></p>\n<p><b>Would you want to go back to that or do you prefer what you’re doing now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In freelancing?</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I mean, I&#8217;ve always  I&#8217;ve had this idea of one day, just owning a studio and doing strictly client work on a more structured basis. I just don&#8217;t want to go back to how I was doing it previously [laughter].</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no class to learn how to do graffiti. You just had to figure it out, and take your knocks, and your critiques. And people will cover your stuff with expletives, which is more in your face than a design critique, but in the same way that&#8217;s kind of really helped me be able to kill my darlings and focus on bettering my craft. I don&#8217;t get attached to things. Everything I’ve created since day one has been temporary, from graffiti to iterating in designs, so if we&#8217;re going to kill it and make something better, I&#8217;m all for it. I think it&#8217;s a strength [chuckles].&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Yeah, for sure. So, your background&#8217;s in graffiti, which I think is really cool. And how do you feel like that informs your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It showed me the underbelly of society—the good and the bad of it. It helps humanize the strangers out on the street, and it absolutely helped me empathize in things like user testing or doing emotional design. It&#8217;s also helped me really cut my teeth to some hard challenges. </span>There&#8217;s no class to learn how to do graffiti.

I think it&#8217;s a strength [chuckles].</p>\n<p><b>Have you had mentors or folks that you looked up to for inspiration on the way?</b></p>\n<p class=\"body_text\">Yes, I think the core group of mentors that—that during Google+ came out to my little event that I held—I really looked up to them in such a serious way. They’ve made me the designer I am today. Among them are Mike Buzzard, Brynne Evans, Chris Messina, Christa Sanders and Chikezie Ejiasi. In each of their own ways, they each taught me so much about design and tech, building my soft skills and design chops. They helped to demystify my preconceptions about what I saw, at the time, as the ivory tower of tech.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"body_text\">&#8220;I was worried it would be a bunch of privileged, rich, Harvard-dropout types. While the stereotypical person in tech certainly exists, it&#8217;s not by any means the norm that I’ve experienced. From what I’ve seen, it’s people who are drowning in debt and struggling to make it by, and people who lost their previous jobs when the economy tanked, and who have real worries.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><b>What were your preconceptions?

I went to a design meet-up, and I heard a couple designers right in front of me talking pretty offensively about people from the Middle East. Because perhaps they looked around and didn&#8217;t see anyone wearing a turban, they thought it was okay to talk like this. People say what they want to say when they think it&#8217;s okay. They&#8217;ll do a quick racial check around themselves, and then they can take the filters off. It&#8217;s made me a little bit more distrustful, or maybe a bit more cynical, of the design and tech community. For every bit that is the optimism I have, there&#8217;s a part that&#8217;s wanting to cautiously question who I&#8217;m talking to, or the people around me.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’m Persian, and I have a lot of family from the Middle East.

Like ethnically?&#8217; I’ve always dreaded any ethnic-related questions in interviews, and I&#8217;ve had a couple of times people break what&#8217;s acceptable to talk about in interviews and ask me what my ethnicity was in tech, just generally.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s wild.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It sounds made up for so many reasons.

Despite falling within that range, I find myself identifying and just appreciating more with how people who are closer to a decade or two into their career. Maybe it&#8217;s because all of them who chose not to clean up how they act, didn&#8217;t make it that far [chuckles].</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"body_text\">&#8220;Thinking back—it seems like everyone who&#8217;s been saying such extreme and inappropriate things has been earlier in their career—no more than 4 or 5 years into their career.

What motivates you, and what are the motivations behind your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To me, </span>finding design inspired me with something to really fight through chemo for. I was so depressed and just mugging through everyday. It gave me something to really purpose myself towards. Ever since then, I&#8217;ve always had this greater idea &#8211; or greater purpose, or need &#8211; to just do massive amounts of good.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And I&#8217;m really trying to refrain from saying the stereotypical, &#8220;Make the world a better place.” [laughter] That’s kind of become a trademarked term in Silicon Valley.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Finding design inspired me with something to really fight through chemo for.

I’d rather use design to solve problems that people can’t afford to not have solved. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To me it’s not necessarily about calling a ride faster, but maybe how to get clean water. Or how to get food. Or the basic necessities to life. I think that kind of design, for me, is my greatest inspiration.</span></p>\n<p><b>Do you think your background and life experience—do you think that feeds into that desire to affect greater the world than just here in Silicon Valley?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Absolutely. Even as a kid, I had a pretty broad world view just like having family in the Middle East but also being Native American. I think that&#8217;s really humanized a lot for me.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do your friends and family feel about the work that you&#8217;ve done?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They love it. My current work at Whistle is a common point for a lot of friends and family. We all have rescued dogs, so it’s a huge motivator to design with those pups in mind.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There’s some genuine good work being done out there.

It was part of the reason why I was so excited to work at Whistle. It&#8217;s just really cool to build something for something that&#8217;s so close to my heart, and the hearts of my friends and family.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s cool to hand them a tech device and say, &#8220;Hey, I helped make this thing.

What excites you about it, what frustrates you about it?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whoa. [laughter]</span></p>\n<p class=\"body_text\"><b>Loaded question.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, a lot excites me. I think that there&#8217;s a very democratic change happening to how companies are founded, and how they are threatened by one another that lets the users ultimately win. I work with IOT devices—the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things\" target=\"_blank\">Internet of Things</a>—and the space is really starting to really feel validated. I see a lot of huge opportunity in connecting various devices, and letting them all interact with one another &#8211; especially in the medical field. Biometric sensors have a long way to go and </span>I can think of personal times in a hospital bed being covered and tangled up in IV lines—could have been relieved by having everything be wireless and connected.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> [chuckle] It&#8217;s a pretty graphic image to think of, but imagine being lined up with IVs in your arms and then falling is the worst thing ever. IOT could make that fear never exist again. [chuckles]</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I can think of personal times in a hospital bed being covered and tangled up in IV lines—could have been relieved by having everything be wireless and connected.</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Quite literally my worst fear.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One day, thanks to technology, no one will ever have to experience that fear come to life.</span></p>\n<p><b>But I am curious, because when I—recently I had my first major surgery. When your appendix bursts you could die, and that moment was kind of getting struck by lightning for me. And my priorities have completely—they haven&#8217;t changed necessarily—but all this other little shit that used to take up mindspace doesn&#8217;t matter anymore.  And I&#8217;m curious how becoming so sick so early and almost losing your life—how do you feel like your perspective and your priorities are different than other young designers around you?</b></p>\n<p>I feel like my priorities are definitely different than my peers. It&#8217;s going to sound like a super old dusty thing to say, but “fun” isn’t exactly what excites me about life or what I, in any way, feel the need to focus my time on. I&#8217;d much rather spend 36 hours a day building something that&#8217;s going to outlive me, because at any moment—very literally—bad news could come in. And your present self is the culmination of all your choices in the past. I want to make sure that whenever that ultimate day comes along, I’ve got a lot of shit that stays around after I’m gone.</p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in five or ten years? Do you think you&#8217;ll be in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I&#8217;ll definitely still be in tech in five or ten years. Specifically in product design. Not entirely sure about still being in San Francisco. Nothing against the city—but I&#8217;ve traveled a lot my whole life—and I just love the idea of one day designing in Brooklyn or something, and one day designing somewhere in Colorado, or Portland, or Zimbabwe. Or Vietnam. [chuckles]</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I feel like my priorities are definitely different than my peers.

There’s such a bright light at the end of this tunnel. At the end of this career I want to look back and see so much cool stuff I&#8217;ve built. And that&#8217;s not going to happen if I let everything get to me, or if I get bummed out by material things. So I guess just focus on what&#8217;s really important if you&#8217;re looking back from the end of your life and let that guide you. </span></p>\n<p class=\"body_text\">",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Where are you from? What were your early years like and where did you come from?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am, technically, from Germany. I was born in Germany because I&#8217;m a military kid, but I lived all over the place. My path was Germany, to New Mexico, to Miami, to Alaska, to South Carolina, back to Alaska, back to Miami, back to Alaska, then to Atlanta, then New York, then California. I have to look at the map in my head as I&#8217;m saying that [chuckles].</span></p>\n<p><b>How&#8217;d you first get interested in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was younger my mom had a computer in the house. She was in the Air Force, also, and she did combat plans. And she had the computer around, and I used to poke around on it. And this was before Windows even happened. I still very much remember the black and green screen. And then about 5th grade— I was poking around when I was little, just playing Carmen Sandiego and that sort of thing. In about 5th grade my teacher decided that I should go to this thing that was in the city because we were in Alaska by this time. And so I got in a taxicab and went to a city as a ten-year-old all by myself, which — I thought I was grown. But it was teaching kids how to use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard\" target=\"_blank\">HyperCard</a>, which is, I don&#8217;t know, very early precursor, predecessor, I guess, to the web. It didn&#8217;t connect, but it was the idea of linking things together, and that&#8217;s how you navigated it. So I learned that, and then I was like, &#8220;I love this. I want to do this.&#8221; And I was just so enamored with computers, and I just spent all the time I possibly could either reading books or on computers. And then I learned how to install things on computers. And I learned how to dabble in hacking computers—and then senior year in high school I took a zero hour class which is like a class before school started that was not for credit that was learning how to program calculators. TI-83s. So we wrote <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC\" target=\"_blank\">BASIC</a> on calculators which was good times typing and pressing those little buttons. There was no keyboard. Oh, yeah. Writing code on those things is not fun, but I got that. I got that feel, got that passion for it. So I—</span></p>\n<p><b>You went to school early for it!</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. And I was writing and making websites when I was a teenager and that sort of thing. My Geocities site was legit [laughter].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But yeah, I had that and I was like, &#8220;All right! I want to do this for my job.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I went to school at the University of Miami and I was a CS major for a year and it was the worst thing I ever did. Going back to Miami was great, but going to school next to one of the best beaches in the world was not a good idea when you&#8217;re coming from Alaska. Because it&#8217;s like, &#8220;But the beach is there. Class? The beach is there.&#8221; Then, when your classes are horrible because you&#8217;re the only woman, or one of  a few women in your CS class, and also you&#8217;re the only black person or one of two black people, and definitely the only black woman in your CS class, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go there. It doesn&#8217;t feel good. The professor sucks and also he looks at me like I shouldn&#8217;t even be there. He won&#8217;t even call on me when I raise my hand, and he acts like I&#8217;m wasting his time,&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like it.&#8221;  So I didn&#8217;t finish my CS major there. I left after my first year and went back to, the University of Alaska, switched to a degree program, an AS degree, micro-computer support, which they&#8217;ve changed to IT something or another. Finished that, and then started working for the University. I intended to get my bachelor&#8217;s but they were like, &#8220;Hey, 21 year old Erica, we&#8217;re going to pay you $45,000 a year. Into it?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yup. Into it. Give me the money.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><b>So that was your first foray into work.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was it. Windows Domain Administrator for the University of Alaska Statewide Systems.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Amazing. And so walk me through the path from that to what you&#8217;re doing now? Take me through it.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Windows domain admin at the University of Alaska. I got married—that didn&#8217;t work out. Then I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m getting the fuck out of Alaska.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;All right. I&#8217;m going to apply for any job in a warm place.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;East Coast&#8221;, because that is where the rest of my family is.  My dad was in Florida at the time. I was like, &#8220;Okay, anywhere in the East Coast that&#8217;s warm: I&#8217;m there.&#8221; I applied for a network operations position at Home Depot&#8217;s headquarters. Got that. Moved my entire life to Atlanta in three weeks from Alaska, which was fun. Yeah. I was at Home Depot for a year—I did network operations and mobile desktop support—then switched to this company called Scientific Games because they were going to pay me more money to do desktop support. So I did that. While I was there, someone told me about this site called Craigslist. I was like, &#8220;What is even a Craigslist?&#8221; I was looking at Craigslist and there was a job opening for Google. I was like, &#8220;Google doesn&#8217;t advertise jobs on Craigslist. No one even knows what Craigslist is. Why would Google have their jobs there?&#8221; I applied for this job at Google and I thought it was fake. I thought it was pretend, right? &#8220;This is a scam. I&#8217;m going to use my throwaway email address because this is totally a scam, but I&#8217;m going to send them my resume. But I know this is not real.&#8221;, until I flew in for my onsite interview in New York. And at this point I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, so this is not fake. This is for real. Let me put my game face on.&#8221; So I pull up to New York, put my game face on, got the job. Worked at Google for nine years. Started as a field tech—which is kind of desktop support plus plus, and then did Google TV for awhile because I&#8217;m really into TV—I like to watch TV a lot—and then I switched back to the corporate engineering organization, and then I switched to SRE,  Site Reliability Engineering. </span></p>\n<p>After that I went to <a href=\"https://slack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Slack</a>, because I was like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t work at Google anymore. It&#8217;s horrible. It hurts my soul to work here. I&#8217;m gonna work somewhere that is either making a difference in the world, or a place where I can be happy.&#8217; Slack was a place where I can be happy.</p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m assuming that in your nine years at Google— I kind of want to dig deeper into— hopping from department to department, how was that? What were some of the projects that you worked on? Hopefully there were some parts that were really exciting and appealed to you and that you&#8217;re proud of.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Atlanta it was cool because it was a small office and there were a lot of people there and it was very diverse. This was the most diverse office I worked in my entire time at Google. Everybody was there. When I moved to the New York office, it wasn&#8217;t as diverse. Also I was in a cold place again. Bad choice [laughs].  But I worked on  my favorite projects there, which is when Google did the DoubleClick acquisition, I did the IT onboarding. I was responsible for making sure all 500 employees that we onboarded got all their stuff, like their hardware, their usernames. I had to set up a whole process to get 500 people through the onboarding process within two days.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that project was one of the most stressful things I&#8217;ve ever, ever done in my life. It&#8217;s one of the most rewarding projects that I&#8217;ve ever done. And I only got to do that project because my manager switched to a female manager at the time, and she believed in me and was like, &#8220;Erica can do this. She&#8217;s going to do it.&#8221; I don&#8217;t think that any other manager would have taken that chance on me because it was huge and I really appreciate her. She&#8217;s one of my favorite people at Google. I hope she ends up running Google one day, she was great.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And I switched— when I left New York, when I came to Mountain View, I was an Exec Tech and that was interesting, being in a position to work with all the executives at Google is tricky, because they are in positions—or were in positions—where they felt like they could say whatever they want to say. They didn&#8217;t have to put any checks on what they said. One executive thought I was my office mate&#8217;s admin assistant, walked in and was like, &#8220;Is Frank here?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;No Frank&#8217;s not here.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, well can you tell him I came by and take this message?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Can I help you with something? Do you need technical support or something? Is there something I can bring you?&#8221; Like, &#8220;Oh, you can do that too?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, I just thought you were his admin assistant.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Word? Really? Really?!&#8221; So that was super frustrating. They just had no qualms about saying the most fucked up shit. One of the executive&#8217;s admins— I was sitting outside a board meeting, and she walks over to me—as I&#8217;m sitting outside of the board meeting—and she&#8217;s, &#8220;Are you security?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No. I&#8217;m sitting here in my not security uniform wearing my work dress clothes, because I&#8217;m sitting outside a board meeting waiting for them to tell me that they need support with something. No! Not security!&#8221; I was so pissed off about that, but that sort of thing happened all the time. It was interesting, it was never that overt in either Atlanta or New York. I didn&#8217;t have much issue in New York, aside from them passing me over for stuff that could help my career for white dudes. That was the only problem I had in New York. Nobody ever came up to me and was like, &#8220;I think you&#8217;re an admin,&#8221; or &#8220;You must be security, because what else would you be doing here.&#8221; Working with the exec support— like the project I worked on, like working with the exec assistants to help them get their jobs done, like writing one auth little tools for them to blast an entire department with emails to go on a ski trip. Neat little tools to help them— I don&#8217;t know, like migrate from Palm contacts to Google contacts because that was the thing that they had to do. That was fun. That was rewarding. Even though there was bad, there was that good. There were some good people I was working with.</span></p>\n<p><b>Well, we&#8217;ve already touched on this a good bit, but what have been your biggest struggles?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like those things that I told you about. People just assuming that because I am a black woman—the worst one is people who assume that I only got hired because of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action\" target=\"_blank\">affirmative action</a> or whatever. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;No. I came in and I destroyed the interviews, and that&#8217;s how I got hired. I&#8217;m really fucking smart. I don&#8217;t throw it around, but I&#8217;m in <a href=\"https://www.mensa.org/\" target=\"_blank\">MENSA</a>. I&#8217;m not dumb, but you want to assume just because you look at me, you see I have brown skin and I&#8217;m a woman that, somehow, I&#8217;m not worthy. Immediately, that&#8217;s your assumption, and that is the worst thing that I have to deal with always.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;People just assuming that because I am a black woman—the worst one is people who assume that I only got hired because of Affirmative Action or whatever. It&#8217;s like, &#8216;No. I came in and I destroyed the interviews, and that&#8217;s how I got hired. I&#8217;m really fucking smart.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wrote this thing called “The Other Side of Diversity.” I had been going to therapy and I was like, &#8220;I need to work out and figure out why I&#8217;m so unhealthy.&#8221; I was writing things— there were so many other things that I wrote about my life that I posted on my personal blog, and this one thing was like, &#8220;This is going to be the thing I write about working in tech, what it feels like to be a black woman in tech.&#8221; Everybody&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, we need more women of color in tech,&#8221; but here&#8217;s what it actually feels like to be a woman of color in tech. I wrote it all down and then it got so much feedback and when I wrote it, I was like, &#8220;This is what it feels like for me, but I didn&#8217;t know that it was everybody. There were so many people who were like, &#8220;This is exactly my story, this has happened to me, all these things.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;You know what? I don&#8217;t need to put myself through this.&#8221; There are other options out there. I don&#8217;t need to be hurting myself because someone says, &#8220;Oh, Google is the best place to work.&#8221; P.S., not the best place to work at all. But there was just a moment where I was like, &#8220;You know what, I don&#8217;t need to be here. I can go somewhere else.&#8221; At that point, I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go somewhere else,&#8221; because staying here will literally make me sick. It will make me stressed out, and stress leads to sickness, and I&#8217;m not going to do it anymore. And so I left. Right? [chuckles] </span></p>\n<p><b>It&#8217;s amazing you lasted nine years.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My family got a lot of pride out of me working at Google. I was the one who made it, and I didn&#8217;t want to let them down. After a while, I was like, &#8220;I need to do this for me.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><b>How&#8217;s life been at Slack?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So great. It&#8217;s just so different to work in a place where the focus on inclusion comes from leadership. At Google, Larry would sometimes say something about diversity when a bad thing happened, but he would never proactively be like, &#8220;We need to fix this. This is a problem for us. I care about this.&#8221; It was either a PR situation for him or it was that something bad happened and we need to make sure that people know that we care about the diversity. But at Slack, Stewart was just like, &#8220;Yeah, this is important. This is super important to me, and this is super important to this company. We need to be out ahead of this before we even become a big company. This is really fucking crucial. We can&#8217;t mess this up,&#8221; because he&#8217;s so big on fairness and justice and making sure that we don&#8217;t contribute to the problems in tech. And so just to have the different ethos at the top of the company affects so much. Every company should be run by a philosophy major.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Just to have the different ethos at the top of the company affects so much. Every company should be run by a philosophy major.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Tell me about whether or not you&#8217;ve had mentors or role models or even inspiration during your time in tech, or none at all?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">None. No mentors. I guess maybe the lady I told you about who believed in me to do the project, that was the closest thing to a role model. I had something like a mentor for the last few months I was at Google, and she was pretty cool, but she was super busy, because everybody knew she was great, and so we rarely had time to meet up. Besides those two, from my 15 years in tech, I&#8217;ve not had a mentor, ever. People like to mentor people who look like them, and there&#8217;s nobody in tech who looks like me. Well not nobody, but there are very few people in tech who look like me. There are definitely very few within my line of work, like in operations and system administrations and that sort of thing.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, for sure. And your family&#8217;s not here, so I&#8217;m curious to know where you found early support networks.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, my mom was up in Yuba City and my sister is still up in Yuba City. My mom passed away in 2010, but my step-dad is still there, and my sister and her kids and husband are still there so, when I need to get away, that is where I go. But outside of going to see them, like there were no support networks here for me, until I decided that I needed to not be in the South Bay. Because there&#8217;s nothing there for me, like everybody there treated me like I was different, because I looked different, and so I felt different.  Oakland, it was like &#8220;Oh, hey, my people.&#8221; And I now have a great support network, I have so many friends and places I can go and get away from tech, which is important to me. I think that&#8217;s a good thing for everyone to have, an outlet to get away from tech.</span></p>\n<p><b>How did you do it?</b></p>\n<p>I just survived. I didn&#8217;t flourish. We have this thing at Slack called &#8220;thriving,&#8221; and I didn&#8217;t thrive, I survived. That’s how I did it. So glad I feel like I’m living again, versus existing.</p>\n<p><b>What are your biggest motivators? What drives you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making sure my nieces and nephews have a good role model. My nieces and nephews’ mom and dad are great, but they aren&#8217;t in tech and my nieces and nephews don&#8217;t see that tech is a thing that someone can do. I want for them to be able to see me do these things. I want for them to see me achieve. I want them to know that it is something that they can aspire to. That&#8217;s a huge motivator for me. My work on diversity and inclusion, I am motivated by making sure that the industry gets better for people who come after me. Because I don&#8217;t want anybody else to have to experience what I experienced. Diversity and inclusion work is not my first choice. If I could be spending my free time doing stuff, I&#8217;d be doing genealogy all the time. That is what I love to do. But I work on diversity and inclusion because it&#8217;s super important. Right now I get to have this voice—people listen to me for some reason, and I have support at work to continue speaking about these things;and permission to say whatever I feel from the CEO of my company—which is super rare, Not everybody gets that. And it&#8217;s a huge privilege, and so I&#8217;m not going to waste that privilege. I want to use it to speak up so that we can make improvements. I think the first step is talking about what&#8217;s going on and then getting uncomfortable. It&#8217;s not going to be easy, right? Talking about sexism and racism is super hard, but I feel like we keep talking about it, people will get used to talking about it. And then we can move on to fixing it.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think we are doing major things and making major accomplishments and taking major steps forward in tech. So many innovations, so many new cool things out there. Tech itself is great. The social structures, I guess that have been built within tech, the diversity of Tech? Horrible. The way people behave in Tech, horrible. We’ve created this system wherein as long as you know how to write code, as long as you perform well in your job, you should feel free to say whatever you want to about whoever. Like that’s the system we’ve built, and that’s not so good.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The problem in Tech is that nobody wants to acknowledge that because they want to believe that it’s a meritocracy. They want to believe that their hard work is what got them here like they’ve struggled and suffered for all this time and that’s how they got here instead saying, &#8216;Maybe you got here because that guy you knew in college he referred you for a job but he didn’t refer the black girl who was also in the same class who actually got better grades than you.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And also, people are so married to this idea of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy\" target=\"_blank\">meritocracy</a> and like “Oh Tech is a meritocracy,” and whatnot that they can’t get beyond that and see that Tech is just another part of the society we’re in and it is affected by systemic racism, systemic sexism, and all manner of injustice just like everything else.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem in Tech is that nobody wants to acknowledge that because they want to believe that it’s a meritocracy.

They&#8217;re really really married to that idea that it&#8217;s a meritocracy and if we can convince some folks that it&#8217;s not and that there&#8217;s some systemic issues that we need to work on then I think we can move forward.</span></p>\n<p><strong>I think the idea that it&#8217;s not a perfect meritocracy threatens some people&#8217;s own credentials and it scares them.</strong></p>\n<p>Oh it definitely does, and I think that there are many people who are frightened of it.  Yes. They&#8217;re so scared of that. Because to consider that maybe you are not like this super smart, super special person, that got into tech&#8230;like that&#8217;s the story that they&#8217;ve been told, like at Google &#8220;we hire the BEST engineers in the world, only the best. We get all the best.&#8221; It&#8217;s the story that they&#8217;ve been spoon-fed and they get attached to that story, and to take that story away is just like NO. This legitimizes me. This makes me important, and to take that away is like, now they don&#8217;t have something to cling to, to show that they have value.</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah. I remember the moment where I became disillusioned. It was when I worked at this little YC startup, and I was so passionate about the product. I was obsessed with it. But I started seeing that it wasn&#8217;t about the products—for me it was about the product, but for them it wasn&#8217;t about that, it was about finding something that they could sell, or making something decent enough that they could sell. And then, it was about hiring another McKinsey alum to help them sell it through the connections that they all had from their networks and it was just like, &#8220;Oh, this isn&#8217;t about what I thought it was. This is about boys all sitting in a room together and selling stuff to each other.&#8221; And that was a moment where I was like, &#8220;Oh man, like, my high hopes and my naive ideas about what everyone was here for. It&#8217;s not what I thought it was.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To have that moment of realization is hard.  Oh, I thought I was working in the best company in the world. Turns out, no—I believed the hype I drank the Kool-aid. But, no. I am sorry you experienced that. It&#8217;s frustrating.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you think that your background and life experience impacts the way that you approach your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I already spoke about being able to assimilate really easily, so that has impacted my life, But also when I was growing up I had this button that said question authority. And I believe that. I don&#8217;t know where I got it. I am pretty sure my mom never gave it to me, because my mom did not like when I questioned her. She was the authority person. But, you know, I strongly believed in questioning authority. And also there is a song in 1996-1997, in Biggie&#8217;s last album. It was &#8220;N-words bleed&#8221;. And the lyric that really stuck to me was &#8220;N-words bleed just like us. Picture me being scared of an N-word who breathes the same air as me.&#8221; And even though the language is wrong, and the song is about being in the streets, and murder and that sort of thing,that line for me, is like, &#8220;Oh right. That&#8217;s just saying that everybody out there is a person just like me. And I don&#8217;t need to be afraid of them because they&#8217;re just another person. They breathe just like me. They poop just like me. That CEO, or whatever, that I just said, &#8220;Hi&#8221; to or whatever, or emailed or asked the question or didn&#8217;t feel any qualms about talking to, that&#8217;s just another person. They just had different life experience than me and they got a little luckier than I did. And so that has helped me a lot in my career because, for some reason, people think that being able to speak to people in positions of power and authority— it&#8217;s like a magic trick or something. No. They&#8217;re just other human beings.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Let&#8217;s go back to Slack. As an outsider, I just feel like they&#8217;re leading the front, in terms of diversity and inclusion. And not just in quantitative ways, like everybody&#8217;s doing—posting the numbers or whatever, but hosting Deray at the office. All these little things. And Stewart not being afraid to speak up as an executive.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The head of diversity should be the CEO. CEO can have a deputy. It&#8217;s like, this is my deputy of diversity or whatever. But the CEO should be the person for whom all diversity reports  go to.  The CEO should be the person who is leading this charge. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the person who everybody has to report to about diversity. This is the person who will tell the company how the diversity is going — that sort of thing. Like, the CEO should be the person in charge, and they might say, you know, the deputy is going to take care of these parts, but you&#8217;re still answering to me about it, right? And so that is what I think should happen with CEOs. Sadly, it doesn&#8217;t happen. Companies just hire Heads of Diversity. And then, they think that&#8217;s all they need to solve the problem. Especially Twitter hiring Head of Diversity that was ineffective as a Head of Diversity in other companies.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The head of diversity should be the CEO.

They need to start focusing on retention and happiness. How are people at your company feeling? A great thing Google did just before I left is that they do these surveys every year called Googlegeist—they surveyed the entire company to see how they are feeling about working at Google. For the first time last year, they asked people, randomly selected groups of people to do a separate ends of the survey. And one of those was diversity related, like if you feel comfortable sharing your gender, if you feel comfortable sharing your ethnicity and then, you know, answer a few questions. And they found that people who were black people at Google, did not feel like they could succeed in the way that other people felt like they could succeed at Google. And that is a huge metric to be watched. That should be what they pay attention to. You&#8217;re hiring? Fine. But, to feel like you cannot succeed in your workplace is a problem. And they need to make sure that number is going up, right? So, companies can be tracking retention, how people feel included in ways that works for them. They should not be high-fiving just because their 2% went up to 3%. That&#8217;s terrible. High-five when your percentage matches the rest of The United States population. When you have, whatever the current percentage is, of black people in The United States at your company, then high-five yourself. Same for the Latinas and Latinos etc. Then you can high-five.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;That should be what they pay attention to. You&#8217;re hiring? Fine.

Come to terms with it. Get really uncomfortable with it and then get comfortable with it and then fix it, right? Recognize that you&#8217;re going to have to do some work on your culture. You just can&#8217;t keep shoving people in like, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re going to just hire all these black people or these Latino people or these women. We&#8217;re just going to keep hiring and hiring, and that&#8217;ll fix it.&#8221; I feel like companies need to recognize that that&#8217;s a problem that they have and then work on it. Like I said, it&#8217;s like we&#8217;re looking at every little thing, and I feel like companies can look at every little thing. Like, &#8220;What is this here for?  Why are we playing ping-pong? What is this serving? Who is this serving? Who is this for?&#8221; That sort of thing. Every single aspect of your culture. Look at it with a fine-tooth comb. It&#8217;s going to be painful, it&#8217;s going to suck! People are not going to like it. But look at every single aspect of your culture with a fine-tooth comb and figure out what is not inclusive. What would feel weird for somebody to participate in? Maybe that trip to the gun range, maybe not the best idea for a team off-site. You know, that sort of thing.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Understand first that your talent is leaving because your culture is horrible. Come to terms with it.

I will go back to the East Coast and work on whatever. Photography maybe. I don&#8217;t know. Something on the East Coast and chill, and not be in this terrible, terrible environment.

And then we can move on to fixing it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>What advice do you have for those from a similar background who want to get into tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If they&#8217;re in tech, recognize that you&#8217;re not alone, find your people. There may be only a few at your company, but there are many of us out there not in your company. Figure out how to get to your people. There are women in tech groups, and women of color in tech groups, and people of color in tech groups all over FaceBook. And there&#8217;s Slack groups or whatever. Find your people, and I can&#8217;t even stress how important that is because it gives you a place to go when you feel like there&#8217;s nowhere to turn. Try not to get discouraged. I&#8217;m not going to tell people not to rage-quit because I&#8217;ve been right on the cusp of doing that many times. But try not to get too discouraged, and if you do get too discouraged, tell your people. If you found them, well they can help you out with that. Don&#8217;t be afraid to speak up, and if you feel like you don’t have a voice and  you need your story to be told I&#8217;m happy to tell stories for anybody. If you need to be anonymous I&#8217;m happy to do that. For people who aren&#8217;t in the industry already, make sure you really want to be here. You have to really want to be here to deal with all this shit. Like if I did not love computers as much as I do I would not still be here. If I did not love tech as much as I do I would not be here. I&#8217;d be off somewhere trying to get a law degree or something because that was what I wanted before I discovered computers, I wanted to be a lawyer, so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d be doing. But I love Tech so much, that I can’t let go of it. But make sure you really want to be here, because that love is what&#8217;s going to keep you here when someone tells you that you shouldn&#8217;t be here. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Try not to get discouraged.

Tell me a little bit about your early years and where you come from.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born and raised in Boston. My parents are immigrants from South America, and I am the first generation American in my family. I grew up in acity called Somerville, a really nice area outside of Boston that’s been getting more attention lately. Mostly, it’s experiencing gentrification, partially led by Harvard, but ia nice diverse city made up of immigrant and working class families. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When my parents left Brasil for the U.S., they left behind interesting lives and successful careers there. A lot of people assume that every immigrant who came to the US was looking for a better life or to chase the “American Dream,” but my parents didn’t have much of a choice. My older brother needed open-heart surgery and the only hospital successfully operating on children was in Boston.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So my parents came to the US so he could get the life-saving surgery and care that he needed.</span></p>\n<p>&#8220;When my parents left Brasil for the U.S., they left behind interesting lives and successful careers there.

My older brother needed open-heart surgery and the only hospital successfully operating on children was in Boston.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not knowing English or knowing anyone here, they realized pretty quickly that it was really hard work. With few options, they started their own house cleaning business. They made flyers that read, “We put your house to shining.” I was too young to really understand but when I found a copy of the flyer when I was about 13 or 14, I thought it was amazing. I showed my mom and we laughed for a moment, but we then talked about how hard it was for her to be a domestic worker.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After my parents divorced and my mother switched careers, I saw her blossom into this really awesome woman. She started her experiences and background to make positive changes around her. She became an advocate for immigrant women, survivors of abuse, domestic workers and became a bit of an organizer.  As a kid, I didn’t fully appreciate what she did. I just assumed, “Oh, this is my mom. This is what all kids do. They go to these rallies, right?” </span></p>\n<p><strong>In your pre-interview that by the time you were 18, you already dealt with depression and experienced homelessness, you survived domestic violence, and you’ve given birth to a child.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot happened in my young life and I think when young people share their tough experiences, society’s first instinct is to blame their parents. My parents loved me, cared for me, and worked hard to do a lot for me. The issues I faced were complex and layered and the reality is that they were struggling too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometime in my journey through middle school, I became depressed. I wasn’t sleeping, I was anxious, and I was having a hard time finding myself. My doctor was hesitant to label it “depression” and convinced my mom to take me out of my current environment to see if a change of scenery for an extended period of time would help me. She did. I spent 2 ½ months in Brasil with her and my brother learning more about my culture, visiting family, riding horses, and being away from what felt like a negative and toxic environment. But the trip had to end and I eventually had to come back home. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think my parents were convinced that my peers were driving me into a downward spiral so they decided at the last minute to enroll me into a private catholic school in the next town over. Horrified, I spent days crying in my room. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new school was supposed to be a new chance for me to be around people who were smart and driven. The problem was that dozens of other parents felt that way too and sent their kids to this school thinking it would resolve all of their core issues. It ended up feeling like a space, a breeding ground, for young people with complex issues who were turning to drugs for relief.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Since it was a Catholic school, we definitely did not receive information about making healthy choices around relationships, dating and sex. We weren’t provided with information on how to keep ourselves safe or recognize signs of abuse. We, the girls, were just expected to keep our legs closed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And since it was a Catholic school, we definitely did not receive information about making healthy choices around relationships, dating and sex. We weren’t provided with information on how to keep ourselves safe or recognize signs of abuse. We, the girls, were just expected to keep our legs closed.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And the message at home wasn’t much different. I was the only girl among my siblings and often felt the burden of supporting my mother to help provide for the family. I did a lot of cleaning and cooking and my mom reminded me that as a kid, she was already the head of the house, hand-washing everyone’s laundry, cooking dinner every day and responsible as the head caregiver for her own 4 siblings. Her expectation for me was not to be an adult, but I was expected to be responsible.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a lot of responsibility and never really getting the help I needed to cope with my issues made me a vulnerable target.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the age of 14, I was in school full-time, involved in a ton of extracurricular activities, babysitting and working as a hostess in a local restaurant so that I could help pay bills. Every month, I would help my mom sort through the bills and make phone calls to service providers to dispute charges or request help.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> My mom knew how to do this, but she explained to me that she felt her english was so bad that people would never take her as serious as they would take me. That </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">even though she was a woman in her 40s, her broken english meant a child with no accent would have more respect in the US. And she didn’t get this idea from nowhere, it came from years of people telling her that they couldn’t understand her or that she should leave the country if she can’t learn english properly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a lot of responsibility and never really getting the help I needed to cope with my issues made me a vulnerable target.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> During a very troubling time in my life, I met  someone a little older than me who maneuvered his way into my life by offering what a young vulnerable girl needed at the time: support. And this isn’t an uncommon tactic. People can sometimes sense when someone is going through something or feeling very vulnerable, but there are certain kinds of people that feel that and use it to prey on them.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;During my junior year of high school, I found out that I was pregnant.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During my junior year of high school, I found out that I was pregnant.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I thought, “Oh my God! This can’t be happening to me. I go to a Catholic school! My parents will hate me.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To of add a layer to that, I knew that my mother was also a young mom and then my grandmother was a young mom, that my aunt was a young mom, and it continues across several generations. And since they are Latinas, I like to talk about the reality of teen pregnancy in our culture. In our communities, young motherhood isn’t framed as a negative outcome. At the same time, young motherhood isn’t the expectation. But in a culture where women are denied access to quality education and/or prevented from pursuing careers, the next step in life for young women is marriage and/or motherhood. And that was the story for a lot of the women in my family. There was no reason to wait until 30. If you didn’t intend on going to college or establishing a career, what are you supposed to do for over 10 years between your high school graduation and the “ideal” age of motherhood. But what happened, at least this is how I see it, my parents assumed that because I was born in the US, that I would adopt American cultural norms and beliefs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I got pregnant at 17 and the first adult I told was my school nurse. In theory, you would think the school nurse would understand, what is essentially, your health condition and provide you with unbiased advice. You assume that as a medical professional, they will help you. Being in a Catholic school made my pregnancy a little more complex. What I heard was, “You already made a mistake so you can’t make another one.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Of course, this was the discussion around my reproductive choice and instead of providing me with all of my options and going through what the best choice was for me might be, I didn’t have a choice. Despite that, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I walked away thinking about the reality that I could still get an abortion and no one would know. I could just do it, tell no one, and start all over. But I think my nurse knew that, so she told all of my teachers about my pregnancy. So here I am: pregnant, junior year in a Catholic school and I had nuns and teachers pulling me aside to tell me what decision I should make and shouldn’t make. “Oh, one sin can be forgiven but not two.”  </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I got pregnant at 17 and the first adult I told was my school nurse.

And I really believed that if everybody knew that I was pregnant, then noticed my belly wasn’t growing, that they’d know what I did. I thought they would judge me and I thought I would end up regretting the decision. I was stuck in a position where I couldn’t make the best choice for myself. And maybe the choice would have still been the same in the end, but at that time my judgment was so clouded. So, I decided to continue with my pregnancy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I told my mom first and she couldn’t believe that her daughter was pregnant. And I don’t blame her. There’s an assumption and a false stereotype about what kind of girls get pregnant. And I didn’t “fit into” that stereotype as a responsible daughter, honor roll student, and class representative. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My parents were upset and I can understand why. They worked really hard in a new country and fought so hard to shed themselves from the stereotypes that Latinos face in the United States. Then they discover their teenage daughter is pregnant. It felt like the ultimate stereotype and they didn’t support me. They kicked me out that day and I had to pack my things and move in with my boyfriend. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Oh my gosh.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That period was really hard for me, because I was leaving a home where I felt safe and in with someone who I barely knew. I was isolated from the only support system I ever had.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;My parents were upset and I can understand why.

And since I was no longer living with my parents, I finished my junior year of high school and enrolled as a senior in a new public high school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In September of 2005, I started my last year of high school as the new pregnant girl. To top off the experience, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">my new guidance counselor learned of my pregnancy and decided to remove me from my honors classes and put me in slower-paced classes. When I asked her to put me back into honors, she told me that I probably wouldn’t even graduate and that I should just try to get by in the lower classes</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – as if she was doing me a favor. But my pregnancy wasn’t impacting my ability to function in class, and I wanted to learn and I wanted to feel challenged. I wanted to continue on the path that I was on, and I couldn’t do that if people were making decisions for me without involving me. Luckily someone else in the school knew about the situation and really wanted to be an advocate for me, and so she stood up for me and said, “Put her back in honors. If it gets to the point where it’s not going well then that’s a whole different story, but put her back in honors.” And they did.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The assumption is that our peers are the ones who will pick on teen moms or give us the hardest time, but they were actually the most supportive to me. My classmates were amazing. They brought me snacks, they carried my books, and they let me cut the lunch line. They asked me questions about what my experience was like, they offered to babysit, and they spent time with me so I wouldn’t feel so alone. In school, it was teachers who were judgmental and mean.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Older women are celebrated, supported, and the people around them will help in any way they can. That doesn’t happen for teenage girls. When we are in pain or afraid, we don’t get help. We’re told our pregnancies are punishments and this is the consequence.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These small gestures helped so much. I was too proud to ask for any assistance, because I didn’t want to be the stereotype of what a teen mom was. I wanted to prove people wrong because I often heard, “You became a teen mom because you wanted free stuff, you wanted handouts.” That fear of judgment actually put me in worse situations because– when I should have asked for help and when I should have gone to people to tell them what was going on, I didn’t want to, because I was afraid they were going to say, “I told you so.” or “You’re just like all teen moms.” People really don’t know what it’s like for a teenage girl to be pregnant, unless you were one yourself. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Older women are celebrated, supported, and the people around them will help in any way they can. That doesn’t happen for teenage girls. When we are in pain or afraid, we don’t get help. We’re told our pregnancies are punishments and this is the consequence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My daughter’s father returned four days before I went into labor. During my daughter’s delivery, there was a moment when I started panicking. Her birth was recorded so I can still watch the moment when I went from grunting to crying to staring at the ceiling. See, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">throughout my entire pregnancy people said things like, “This child’s going to ruin your life. You’re life is over. You’re not going to be able to do any of the things you ever wanted to do. This is the worst thing that could happen to you.” So as I was giving birth to her, I started panicking, because I realized I was giving life to the person who would end mine. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And how do I love someone who is meant to ruin my life? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of that experience and internalized belief, I had a very negative journey through the first few years of motherhood. I was diagnosed with depression and prescribed anti-depressants. To make matters worse, I was in a horrible relationship and was constantly told that teen moms like me are never taken serious and that no one wanted to love a woman with stretch marks and a baby. There was no one cheering me on, no one who believed in me, and I felt entirely alone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, I was constantly facing barriers in school. The school was only required to offer me tutoring in 4 of my 7 classes during maternity leave. It was the minimum required to help me simply pass the school year. But I didn’t want to just pass, I wanted to do well in every class and graduate with a good GPA, like I would have before my pregnancy. So my psychology teacher volunteered to come to my house every week and tutored me in all 7 courses. She brought my exams and quizzes and held my daughter so I could take them. She held my textbooks while I breastfed and was always proud of my progress. Returning to school was tough, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the other teachers weren’t as fond of me or my “situation.” They would refuse to meet with my after school for help and embarrass me in class. One teacher told me in math class that there was no way I could catch up, so I proved her wrong by acing the class.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I even had to fight for things like the right to pump breast milk twice a day. The school didn’t want to let me because they thought I was trying to find excuse to get out of class. Right. Because what every 18-year-old girl wants is to like skip her lunch break so she can be sit in the nurse’s office pumping milk and nibbling on crackers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But</span><i> </i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I even had to fight for things like the right to pump breast milk twice a day. The school didn’t want to let me because they thought I was trying to find excuse to get out of class. Right. Because what every 18-year-old girl wants is to like skip her lunch break so she can be sit in the nurse’s office pumping milk and nibbling on crackers.</span><i> </i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is so much fun. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I dealt with a lot of people who constantly tried to limit my choices and my future. Then closer to the end of that semester, I went back to my guidance counselor’s office to ask if she could help me look over college applications. Most of my friends had already applied and had already found out where they were going, and I was late but wanted to do make it happen. Her response without even making eye contact with me was, “Well, let’s see if you even graduate high school first.”</span></p>\n<p><strong>God.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I walked away from that and thought, “Oh, she’s probably right. I probably won’t be able to do this, and I should probably take things one step at a time.” So I didn’t apply for college. Now, the good news is I did graduate high school on time and I did walk the stage with my class. I did get to stay in my honors classes throughout the whole year, and I did well in all of them, despite being a teen mom. I think, actually, I did better in school because I was a teen mom and because I had something else motivating me to do even better.  But people outside of me and my daughter’s life didn’t see that.  </span></p>\n<p><strong>So, you graduated, you didn’t go straight to college—what were those next few years like for you?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was in high school I really, really wanted to go to med school. I wanted to become a psychiatrist. Having been a young person who coped with depression, I knew what people like me needed and I understood the differences in cultural understanding of depression. For example—parts of my family are really religious and there have been times people said things like, “You’re not depressed, you’re just dealing with something. Pray to God. You’ll be fine.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;No one in my family filled out a college application. I had no idea of what that process was like, I had no idea of what you were supposed to do, when you were supposed to do it, what was normal, what wasn’t.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I knew at a young age that this was not right.  I just couldn’t articulate or figure it out, but I wanted to become a psychiatrist so that I could serve and help young people, like me. Now, the idea of going to med school was really overwhelming because again, my parents were immigrants and they weren’t citizens, and they weren’t in the best financial places, and no one in my family had ever gone to college. So I knew that first, they wouldn’t able to co-sign loans for me and I felt overwhelmed at the thought of the expense. And even if I chose another career, I didn’t know how to navigate the process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No one in my family filled out a college application. I had no idea of what that process was like, I had no idea of what you were supposed to do, when you were supposed to do it, what was normal, what wasn’t. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea of a young mom with no support becoming a psychiatrist felt way too overwhelming. It felt unattainable. So what I did was, after I graduated, that summer I looked at local state and community colleges that would accept late applications.I might not be able to become a psychiatrist right away but I can start the process  by becoming a nurse. It seemed a little more attainable and promised a guaranteed job.  So I applied for college, started in the fall, finished off my prerequisites, and prepared for a career in nursing.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I entered college with a new identity. I didn’t tell anyone that I was a mom, including my professors. I just so badly wanted to be treated the same as everyone else.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I entered college with a new identity. I didn’t tell anyone that I was a mom, including my professors. I just so badly wanted to be treated the same as everyone else.</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem was that I was still facing unresolved issues and an internalized belief that I was not valuable. So I didn’t ever explain anything to my professors and by my second year of school, I dropped out. I didn’t have reliable childcare, I was still coping with depression, and I was working a full-time job and living on my own.  I decided that if I was going to accomplish anything, I needed to take care of myself. That I was going to focus on being a good mom and practice self-care. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Wow. How did you end up in tech?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s a great question. It’s quite a little bit of a journey from that point to getting into tech. I don’t have a traditional tech background, as I think a lot of people do out here. After I took this break from school I started focusing on myself. I started to deconstruct and redefine what it meant to be a young woman and single mother in today’s society. I started talking to other young moms—which was life-changing—because it really helps when you don’t feel as isolated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started realizing that thousands and thousands and thousands of young women across the country are dealing with the same exact thing. 100,000 teens give birth every year—more than 80% were unplanned—and so many of them drop out of school, or feel pressured to leave or didn’t receive the support that they need to stay. Yet, many some of them share that it’s not actually pregnancy and parenthood that makes their lives hard, as we often hear, but it’s actually the way people treat us. It’s the way that our educators treat us. It’s the way a lot gate-keepers treat us. It’s the ways in which people invalidate who we are as just women and humans in society. The minute we become young parents we’re labeled as irresponsible, and told we’re awful people, and that we should just be isolated and not exposed to the general public because we’d cause an “epidemic.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I began looking at ways to counter-message the false reality that young mothers are not productive members of our society by leveraging the power of new tech, like social media. My first time trying out this theory was with the Children’s Hospital in Boston, where I developed a comprehensive strategy for using new tech to eliminate the feeling of isolation among over 500 young parents in Boston. That opportunity led to a hire at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital where I expanded the program to make an impact on reducing health disparities and improving health outcomes in the lives of young mothers of color in Boston. Then I was hired by  the Massachusetts Alliance on Teen Pregnancy where I worked on a $5M dollar grant from the CDC to reduce the teen pregnancy rate in two cities by 10% in five years. In a few months, I helped develop a social marketing campaign for two cities. We reached our 5-year targets before year 3.  </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Initially, I thought, &#8216;There is no way I want to work in tech. I can’t give into that culture or space because, well, it’s tech.&#8221;  I thought, &#8216;I can’t do that. I can’t be for racial justice and reproductive justice and work in tech. That doesn’t make sense.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While all of this was happening, I also started a grassroots campaign called #NoTeenShame to change a terrifying message that organizations like the Candies’ Foundation and multi-millionaire CEOs like Neil Cole share with teenage girls about sexuality and choice and I partnered with six other young moms from different parts of the country for its launch and within a week, it went viral and we were being featured in everything from Ms. Magazine to Business Insider.  It was exciting for people to see seven young moms of color across the country were starting a campaign against this multimillionaire CEO. It went viral to the point where he caught wind of it and wrote a response on The Huffington Post about it. It was not the response we were hoping, but it was a win for us none the less. Once that happened, we started getting contacted by just about every organization in the United States that was working with young people to get our insight on how to do the work better and more effectively. We got really busy really fast and people just started reaching up to us and asking, “Well, how can we replicate the models that you guys have used in your respective organizations to help young people? What should we be doing differently?” The series of all those events led to me developing strategic frameworks for using new technology for social impact and finally presenting at a tech conference here in San Francisco last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a long time I envisioned tech as the enemy—I’m a reproductive justice activist. I’m a racial justice activist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I wased in San Francisco, I met someone on the executive team at a startup called Honor (where I work now) who was interested in the work that I did,how I accomplished it and how creative I was in using very little resources to accomplish a massive goal. And so we started talking, and I met other people on the executive team. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initially, I thought, “There is no way I want to work in tech. I can’t give into that culture or space because, well, it’s tech”  And so coming into this space, I thought, “I can’t do that. I can’t be for racial justice and reproductive justice and work in tech. That doesn’t make sense.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I had this assumption that social justice didn’t fit into tech, but I think that’s because I based my opinions on the negative stories I heard on the east coast. But once I met the people that were leading the company, I realized that so much of what I assumed about the people in Silicon Valley were wrong. But also that someone like me can still be in tech and be a valuable asset to the work. And as weird as this sounds, I do think I found that special startup that actually developed a really good frame from the very beginning of how they do work. So, I waited a while and I thought about it, went back to Boston, and decided to pursue the opportunity. I thought to myself, “Oh my god. I was 27 years old. I have a daughter. I’m a single mom, and the only family that I have in the US are just four people who live in Boston. And now I’m accepting the  opportunity to move to San Francisco to work in tech.” And that was hard to wrap my head around. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was actually my mom who said, “Natasha, you can do this. You’ve overcome way harder things in your life.” When she was 27, she was on her way  to the US for a completely different life. And so she said, “I did it, and I’m not saying that we’re the same. But you can move across the country to pursue this. You can do this.” She also reminded me that I had to think about my daughter who’s really interested in science and has been going to all these science clubs. I now have an opportunity to actually be in this field, to actually be in tech, and provide her with an inside view of what this world is really like. She can watch me go through this process and this journey, and she’s going to see how hard it is. She’s going to see the good and the bad, but she’s going to see it. And she’s going to appreciate it. So, it was a combination of those things that made me decide to say yes to the new field and the big move. </span></p>\n<p><strong>So, what was Silicon Valley like for you when you first got here? </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s been positives and negatives. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the things that I actually had to overcome when I came here is how fast everything moves. It’s really fast-paced. Everybody told me it was like this, but it was ten times faster than what I’d prepared myself for.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And initially, it was really hard, but I also had a really supportive group of people here where they were willing to help me adjust.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I love that when I’m having lunch and sitting at a table with people who are amazing engineers, or accomplished healthcare professionals, and talented organizers. And we all sit at a lunch table enjoying each other’s company and discussing the very different experiences we’ve had—and how those diverse experiences shaped such an incredible company.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other difficult transition is coming from a space where I talked about racial and reproductive justice 24/7 without filtering myself. Prior to this role, I went to networking events where we introduced ourselves by identifying which pronouns we prefer, the issues we’re working on and how we identify. It’s much different here where I’m often asked to introduce myself by position, educational background and accomplishments. And </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">even when I went to events centered on inclusion, I didn’t feel included. How are so many companies  hosting an event on improving inclusion in the tech sector, hosting in spaces that are difficult to access, and not offering things like child-care? </span></p>\n<p><strong>What has been most exciting of activating for you in your work here?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s been most exciting is the people that I get to work with. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love that when I’m having lunch and sitting at a table with people who are amazing engineers, or accomplished healthcare professionals, and talented organizers. And we all sit at a lunch table enjoying each other’s company and discussing the very different experiences we’ve had—and how those diverse experiences shaped such an incredible company. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite growing up 5 minutes from Harvard and 10 minutes from MIT, I felt so disconnected from people in tech. They seemed so unreachable and different. And I didn’t always see them as the people I wanted to aspire to become. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Harvard grads were the ones moving into our community, pushing families out of homes, so 5 or 6 students could move in, bumping up rent from $1000 to $3000, a profitable idea for landlords. So I witnessed how the growth and expansion of schools like Harvard led to the immersion of grad students into my community, which meant the immigrant and working class families had to leave.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Despite growing up 5 minutes from Harvard and 10 minutes from MIT, I felt so disconnected from people in tech. They seemed so unreachable and different. And I didn’t always see them as the people I wanted to aspire to become.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That played a role in how I perceived tech, even though I was using platforms like Facebook. It didn’t occur to me that someone not too distant from me created this. To the teenage me, it was just something that was created by someone somewhere. It took years before I learned that it was created 5 minutes from my house. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was cool, but it frustrated me because I felt like there were so many issues impacting young people in Somerville and Cambridge and no one seemed to care. And it was frustrating to see people come from all over the world to study here, learn from the community, then leave forever. Now that I’m on the inside, I see how difficult it is to create tools that are genuinely helpful to people—especially if it’s for people of low-income. And it’s frustrating.  </span></p>\n<p><strong>I’m curious to know how that experience, seeing that tech ecosystem in Boston affects the way that you feel about the state of tech here right now? </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boston’s tech scene is very different than it is on the west coast. It’s thriving, but in a very different way. So although I was involved there, it didn’t help much when dealing with imposter syndrome.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I think we often frame and consider imposter syndrome as a one time occurrence that we overcome. But what I learned is that it’s a life-long issue that you’re constantly battling.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> See, when my Boston friends learned the news of my move to San Francisco to work for an Andreessen-Horowitz backed startup, they were amazed. To them, I was doing what so many wished they could do and I was supposed to feel like “I did it!” And I did, but there’s still the reality that you’re constantly needing to be ahead of everyone else and doing incredibly well. I love the field and where I work, but there’s internal self-created pressure to make sure I’m outdoing myself.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;W<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">h</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">en everyone around you has very similar background, you can sometimes still feel like an outsider.

I tend to find myself avoiding conversations that might turn into a discussion about me being a single parent that turns into facing a series of invasive questions. Because it happens. Too often. And it’s not intentional, but their unconscious bias just starts surfacing, and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they ask, “Well, how old’s your kid? How old are you? Oh my God, that mean’s you were in like…” You literally see them every time look up, do the math, and they’re like, “Oh my god, you were 17! What was that like? What did your parents say?” And it just turns into this whole dialogue that I don’t want to be a part of.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Interested in my story? Go read about it or watch Gilmore Girls. I don’t want my struggles to be the center of discussion, especially in a society where we were made to believe that teen parenthood is a bad thing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How has everything we’ve talked about, both your experiences in tech so far, and your upbringing, and all of your cumulative experiences, how does that effect what is priority to you here? What is priority in a job, what is priority in what you’re trying to get out of Silicon Valley?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So it’s actually really interesting, because I feel like a lot of people out here are really focused on long-term planning. There’s nothing wrong with that, it’s necessary, but I feel like my goals are very different than a lot of people in my position. And that has a lot to do with the reality of how much progress I’ve already made in the past decade. I’ve met and exceeding so many of my own expectations for this period of time and I wanted to spend time acknowledging that and perfecting and improving everything I do now. It doesn’t mean I’m not going to push myself to grow more</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m focused on ensuring what I do on a daily basis is amazing and meaningful—I’m focused on leaving behind a legacy that my daughter would be proud to share with her grandchildren.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think a lot about how my mother’s move to the US changed the entire future of our family. So I can’t help but wonder what amazing choices I can make that will continue to do that. If I have the power to shape an incredible future generation, I will do that. And I want to be present today, enjoying my life and my daughter’s life—not waiting for happiness in the form of monetary success. </span></p>\n<p><strong>I’m curious to know how much you’re balancing what you’re working on now and the activism that you’ve been involved with so long, and what it’s like being a part of both of those worlds, especially in the context of San Francisco.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After accepting a position in tech, I thought that I could still be an activist and a writer. But I realized that it was going to take a lot of my mental capacity and energy to adapt to startup culture and do my work really well. Although my personal work is always with me, I knew that I moved across the country for this amazing opportunity and I wanted to dedicate as much a possible to meeting my expectations. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to my move to San Francisco, I was presenting at different conferences and organizations across the countries and being asked to do a lot of consultant and advisory work. I had to start declining a lot of those opportunities. And I had to adjust to the realization that nobody in this sector knows me, which is different than Boston.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Prior to my move to San Francisco, I was presenting at different conferences and organizations across the countries and being asked to do a lot of consultant and advisory work.

That can be challenging when you’re working in an environment where working moms aren’t the majority.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The ways in which you use and prioritize your time is different and participating in after-hours anything is often a challenge, even though they’re usually necessary and important. Childcare is an obstacle when you’re a single mom in a state where you have no family and feel like you’re already spending too much time away from your kid. </span></p>\n<p><strong>How’s your daughter liking San Francisco?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She loves it but hates the hills. I hate it more than she does honestly but she likes it here a lot. Ha!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She’s really thoughtful and friendly so she made a new best friend within her first week in school. It’s been super easy for her in that way. And like I mentioned earlier, she’s now really interested in Science. Back in Boston, she participated in many different science clubs and programs. It helped expand what her understanding of science was and she became really excited about the opportunity for me to work in tech. And I’m glad she felt good about the choice because I hope she can face an obstacle one day and remember that, “My mom went through this too.” And we have deep conversations about girls in STEM and what it’s like to be a girl in a lot of the science programs. It was interesting to me that she wasn’t interested in the field because of the cool “perks” but because she sees this space as the space where she can do amazing things. Her mission is to promote eco-friendly lifestyles and find a cure for Alzheimer’s. After my grandmother passed from Alzheimer’s, she felt deeply connected and spent a year asking me countless questions. She knows we’ve created tech to do some amazing things and hopes she can do something amazing too. And I’m going to nurture her interest in science until she does exactly what she wants to do.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think a lot about tech’s impact on marginalized people, and not just how they use the service but how they actually can be included in the development of new tech.&#8221;</span><i></i></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>How do your friends and family from home feel about how far you’ve come and all you’ve accomplished?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re really happy for me. Actually, I had one friend who she really said, “Natasha I think you did everything you could here. You literally accomplished everything and there wasn’t a better next step than this.” My mom is really proud. </span></p>\n<p><strong>How you feel about the state of tech in 2016? What excites you, what frustrates you, what would you like to see change?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think a lot about tech’s impact on marginalized people, and not just how they use the service but how they actually can be included in the development of new tech.</span><i> </i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is where my previous experience overlaps with what tech is missing—the ability to always center the needs of the people they’re targeting. When we’re talking about young people, I’d love to see them getting the support and resources they need to turn their innovative ideas into reality.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;As a mother in tech, I also faced the reality that so many of the programs meant to nurture girls’ interest in STEM are not easily accessible. The programs are often replicating the very same systems that worked for people already in tech. I’ve found myself feeling like the burden falls on parents to fix the pipeline issue and get girls into STEM.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a mother in tech, I also faced the reality that so many of the programs meant to nurture girls’ interest in STEM are not easily accessible.

I’ve found myself feeling like the burden falls on parents to fix the pipeline issue and get girls into STEM. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One example is </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">my daughter had science club on Saturday mornings, and it was at a college campus, which has its pros and its cons. The pro is that it’s great to send girls to a college to see what that environment is like. The con is that it’s often inaccessible for a lot of parents and families and it requires a lot of commuting. And then the classes are so short that parents, can’t just drop off their kids at the program and then go home or doing something else and then come back. They must sit there waiting. So parents are asked to spend a few hours every weekend getting their kids to this program, waiting for them, and then commuting back home. And that could be a barrier to some. The other barrier, of course, is a lot of these programs are really expensive, so if you’re creating programs that are supposed to improve diversity but they’re really expensive, only the people who make enough money to afford it it will be able to get their children into it.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There’s usually a financial aid or scholarship application, but it puts the burden on parents who are now of low income to prove to the program that their children deserve a chance. Now you have moms and dads or grandparents, being asked to fill out applications that ask invasive questions about their finances.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;They’re asking parents who are already dealing with a lot to prove and to open up about these issues with people they don’t even know, so that their kid can have an opportunity that they deserve. What if parents don’t even speak English or what if they’re undocumented and don’t have tax documents proving they are of low income?&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re asking parents who are already dealing with a lot to prove and to open up about these issues with people they don’t even know, so that their kid can have an opportunity that they deserve.

Initially, it felt like this was being proposed as a new idea, something that’s rarely been done before. It frustrated me. I’ve spent most of my life leaning in for survival. And leaning in is simply what marginalized women across the nation have been doing for their basic human rights for decades.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Before I joined tech, the concept of “leaning in” surfaced onto my radar.

Women aren’t paid fairly, but women didn’t create the unfair ways in which women are compensated. And women of color make significantly less than white women, and face higher rates of discrimination at work. Women leaning in can help change the ways in which women are perceived and treated, but men leaning out create genuine opportunities for women to rise. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leaning out as a man can mean giving up your spot on an all male panel to offer a woman on your team the opportunity, or giving press ops to women, being vocal about the important roles women hold in the company, and of course, paying them a fair and equitable salary. Because the burden of making the workforce fair and equitable shouldn’t be ours to carry.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Leaning out as a man can mean giving up your spot on an all male panel to offer a woman on your team the opportunity, or giving press ops to women, being vocal about the important roles women hold in the company, and of course, paying them a fair and equitable salary.

And when we live in a negative environment, you’re not just internally facing challenges, but you’re getting that external negative validation. Whether you are a teen mom or a young person facing any of the many obstacles that make our lives unnecessarily harder than it needs to be, stay focused on your own dreams. Find a mentor or two who are smart and kind, and only trust them for advice and guidance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And constantly work on yourself and making you the best version you can be. We like to believe that at some point in our lives we reach our full potential, but what if it’s a life long journey where we’re constantly learning and constantly changing and improving? </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t feel like you have to be the final version of you at this very moment, just be willing to learn. Stay true to who you are and accept that you are a work in progress.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Don’t feel like you have to be the final version of you at this very moment, just be willing to learn.

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>So, tell me about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I grew up in the Bay Area. Both my parents were computer science PhDs and software engineers. As a kid I practically grew up in my parents’ office, surrounded by computers. It might seem like I was always destined to be in Silicon Valley and to be a software engineer. But actually, back then, tech wasn&#8217;t glamourous. And I didn&#8217;t actually know what my parents were up to. I didn&#8217;t think of tech as a dream career; I just knew it was one thing that I could do because both of my parents did it. Even though I eventually ended up in tech, it wasn&#8217;t because I had set my sights on it and headed directly there. </span></p>\n<p><b>So you didn&#8217;t always know you would be an engineer. When was kind of the moment that you first became interested in a real way?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can&#8217;t pinpoint a specific moment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was always a possibility because both my parents had been engineers, but even all through college I wasn&#8217;t sure what I was going to do. I started thinking I might want to do linguistics. I also considered bioengineering, because biotech seemed like it might be hot. But I took a class or two in each of those fields and decided they weren’t for me. I ended up doing an electrical engineering major, mostly because of continuous iterations of sunk cost fallacy after I took a circuits class with some frosh dorm-mates. A year into that I decided I didn’t like EE, either. I finally landed in the master’s program for computer science, but still more to prove that I could do a master’s in something technical than anything else. A friend had dared me to do it. As I went through my degree programs, I started to become more okay with the idea of doing something on the engineering side. And so when I was graduating, I looked at data science or data analyst type roles</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">getting closer to engineering, but still not quite there</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; and somewhat reluctantly I </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also interviewed for software engineering roles, because every company was hiring engineers and there were more opportunities there. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the end, I was convinced to join Quora as a software engineer. At that time, the company was only four people and they really just needed engineers to help build out the product. As for my inclinations towards data science or data analysis, there just wasn’t any data yet. Adam told me to try out the engineering side and we could re-adjust later if it wasn’t working. I figured I would give it a shot. So that’s when I actually started doing software engineering. That’s also when I actually started realizing how cool software was. Of course I’d taken computer science classes, I’d done internships, etc. but it wasn’t until I was on the ground floor of a really early stage startup that I understood that we were building a product from scratch and that I realized how powerful it was to be bringing things into existence. Somehow before that I didn’t get that engineering is about building things; a bit ironic, given that I already had two degrees in engineering by that point. But finally at Quora, I got it.  </span></p>\n<p><b>What are some of the things that you are proud of over the course of your career so far?</b></p>\n<p>As an engineer, I’ve found the most exciting and rewarding experiences to be in the early stages of building products and getting them off the ground. I was at Quora early, as #5. I signed on with Pinterest when there were only 8 people on the team. With both companies, I joined before it was clear at all that the products would become big, whether anyone would be interested in using them, and it’s been amazing to be a part of both those early teams building out and scaling consumer web-scale products.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from that, I’ve done some work supporting and advocating for diversity in tech and though I’m just a small part of the movement, I’m proud that the last few years have seen dramatic change in the industry’s awareness of the issues and commitment to fixing them. When I first started working, I felt overwhelmingly alone and frustrated, and I didn’t know whether it was just me, if I had anyone to turn to, and just generally what was even going on. We’re far from having fixed any of our diversity issues, but they’re at least out in the open and people are starting to talk about them now. </span></p>\n<p><b>You are known as a major catalyst in getting tech companies in Silicon Valley to acknowledge their diversity issues. When were the seeds for that planted?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Early on, when I was at Quora, I was very plugged into the startup community and in the course of being on the site itself, going to events, all of that, I got to know people at lots of different companies. Not deliberately, but just offhand, I also came to know how many female engineers were at each of these companies. I had a rough mental catalog. Not perfect, but I had some sense of what companies were up to, and it was more than anyone else had, I think. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then there was a specific moment, when I was at the Grace Hopper conference in 2013, at a group breakfast with Sheryl Sandberg, where she made a comment to the effect of how the numbers of women in tech were dropping precipitously and we needed to take action, that I had the gut response: “How do you know what the numbers are? How does anyone know what the numbers are?” And then I was struck by the irony that in an industry that was so data-driven, where we had metrics and dashboards for everything, where we studied conversion funnels from landing page to signup to activation so fastidiously, where we ran A/B tests for every new color and UI element much less new features; we had no data on diversity.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was at the Grace Hopper conference in 2013, at a group breakfast with Sheryl Sandberg, where she made a comment to the effect of how the numbers of women in tech were dropping precipitously and we needed to take action, that I had the gut response: &#8216;How do you know what the numbers are? How does anyone know what the numbers are?&#8217; And then I was struck by the irony that in an industry that was so data-driven, where we had metrics and dashboards for everything, where we studied conversion funnels from landing page to signup to activation so fastidiously, where we ran A/B tests for every new color and UI element much less new features; we had no data on diversity.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I got home to San Francisco after the conference, with all these thoughts still swirling around in my head, I sat down and wrote a Medium post. It was framed as a call to action but in truth I didn’t expect anyone to take it on. I definitely wasn’t the first person to ask for numbers. Even in the process of writing my post, I went googling and found a CNN report from a few years prior that said that investigators had reached out to a bunch of tech companies to ask their numbers and all the companies said, &#8220;No. No thank you.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I didn’t expect anything to change after I wrote my post. It was a big (and pleasant!) surprise to me when people started sharing their numbers with me over Twitter. But then I realized that my @mentions were not a good place for this data to live, and so I set up a GitHub repository to track it. Why GitHub? It was something that a lot of engineers are used to using. And it supported tracking the metadata: who was submitting the data, what their source was, the date of submission, any other relevant context, and also the history of updates. The project was meant to be crowdsourced, so it was important that we had that metadata. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m up to about 250 companies now that have submitted their data. It&#8217;s mostly the smaller companies, but that’s fine, actually. What’s more important is that there was an upswell in attention on the subject and the larger companies realized too that it was important to publish their data. In May of 2014, a few months after I wrote my Medium post and started my GitHub repository, Google was the first big tech company to release a holistic diversity data report. The story I’ve heard through back channels, though I haven’t been able to validate it, is that people in Google HR got wind of what I was doing, discussed, the question made its way all the way up to Larry, and he made the call to release their data despite objections from legal. And their report was more than just women in engineering; it also had race breakdowns, and it covered tech, business, leadership, etc. After Google, most of the other major tech companies followed suit. It’s become an industry-wide movement. </span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;ve been hearing women recently who work at well-known companies here and talk about wanting to leave those companies for Pinterest, because they want to work with badass ladies and that&#8217;s like becoming more and more of a priority for more and more talented people that just want to be surrounded by with other really talented people.</b></p>\n<p>Yes, I&#8217;ve heard that a lot amongst my friends too. They&#8217;ll say things like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have to put up with BS anymore.&#8221; And I’ve felt similarly myself. Even within Pinterest, where I’ve changed teams a few times, when I’ve looked around, one of my top criteria has been whether there are women that I’d want to work with. Not to say that I’d necessarily rule out opportunities on teams that didn’t have women, but at this point I really prioritize being able to work with other talented women. I’ve worked on a few teams now that had 50/50 gender balance, and I can say that the dynamic is different, and so much better, when that’s the case. That’s not to fault men on more male-dominated teams, but the dynamic really is very different.</p>\n<p><b>Absolutely. How have you seen tech&#8217;s attitude towards women changed since you&#8217;ve started in the industry?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is substantially more awareness now of unconscious bias and the ways in which women (and underrepresented minorities) can be disadvantaged, even if unintentionally. I’ve also seen a lot more allies become a part of the conversation and the solution. But it’s a slow shift. We&#8217;re trying to engineer a really big cultural change, and that takes time.</span></p>\n<p>And people have lived their whole lives under certain conceptions of how things work, their certain beliefs about the world. And it&#8217;s hard to dispel those in just a short period of time.</p>\n<p><b>I get surprised that these people still exist, but explain to those who are in doubt about this why having a team with diverse perspectives is beneficial to a product.</b></p>\n<p>First, there’s the research that shows that diversity makes teams more creative, more diligent and thoughtful. Intuitively that makes sense. People from different backgrounds and perspectives engage in different ways, and in more diverse team settings people are forced to confront the reality that other people may perceive and think about things differently, and therefore end up working a little bit harder to justify their thoughts, their opinions, whatever they’re proposing. And the research also shows that diversity drives better business outcomes. It’s smart business.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;People would make comments about Pinterest like, &#8220;Oh, that seems like a niche market.&#8221; They thought it was niche only because they weren’t women.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>As for the tech industry specifically, we’re building products and services for everyone. The quality, relevance, and impact of these products and services can only be improved by having the people who are building them be demographically representative of the people who are using them. Here’s an example of a very obvious oversight from lack of gender diversity: Apple launched HealthKit in iOS 8 as a comprehensive health and fitness portal app to track nearly everything you could think of tracking, things like blood alcohol content, inhaler usage, sodium intake , but somehow they missed period tracking. This is the one thing that almost all women track and have tracked probably for the entirety of human history, even in the absence of any fancy quantified self devices or apps. But you know, women’s health, no big deal. To be fair, I don&#8217;t know if there were women on the HealthKit team, and maybe there were and something just went awry, but it feels like if there had been more gender balance on that team they wouldn’t have missed something so obvious.</p>\n<p><b>I remember when Pinterest first launched and there was so much hoopla over how this company catered to a population outside of Silicon Valley and grew so huge and it blew people&#8217;s minds. They couldn&#8217;t believe that by catering to the world outside of Silicon Valley that they had tapped into something lucrative. </b></p>\n<p>People would make comments about Pinterest like, &#8220;Oh, that seems like a niche market.&#8221; They thought it was niche only because they weren’t women.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An interesting comparison point is other major Internet properties that skew male. They’re considered neutral. Think Wikipedia. Something like 90% of their top editors are male, but the Wikipedia is regarded as very neutral source of truth. Nobody ever talks about how masculine Wikipedia is, because in our society male is the default. Only when a site has a demographic that skews female does it have to be called out as “so feminine, so female”. </span></p>\n<p><b>Personally, how do you think your background and life experiences have affected the way that you approach your work and your perspectives around the things that you build?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be very honest, I&#8217;ve grown up very privileged and a lot of my life experience matches that of many other people in tech. Somehow the most unusual part of my background is that I’m a woman, which doesn&#8217;t seem like it should be that unusual. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One more thing to mention, maybe: I’m very American, but I&#8217;m also the child of immigrant parents. I still have a bit of the immigrant mentality. There are a lot of things that you don&#8217;t take for granted when you are not from the country you live in—you don&#8217;t have your support systems here, you&#8217;re much more focused on survival, as opposed to assuming that things will always be fine and there&#8217;ll be people to support you. There’s a certain risk aversion that comes from that, an unwillingness to “rock the boat,” so to speak.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are so many other people that have worked on diversity in tech, too. There are so many people that have been a part of this crowd agitating for change. It feels unfair to me that I get the attention that I do. But if I have the stage, I’m going to try to use it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s also that feeling of being an other. I grew up never seeing any images in media of people who looked like me, whether in entertainment, politics, business… I was just talking to some friends the other day about Disney movies and which ones we like the most. My favorite has always been </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mulan</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but it&#8217;s hard for me to know if I like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mulan</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the best because she’s the only one who looks anything like me, or if I would have liked it the same with a blonde blue-eyed princess. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On that dimension of being race and being Asian, though, one interesting thing about tech is that Asians are so overrepresented. Asians aren’t a minority in tech. When people talk about people of color in tech, they don&#8217;t include Asians even though Asians are people of color.</span></p>\n<p><b>So obviously your diversity work has kind of thrust you into the public, and you&#8217;ve become a very public face of diversity. How has that affected your life? I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s been positive and a little scary.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s been surprisingly positive.</span></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s good.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I do find the attention a little strange because I don&#8217;t think my story is that special or that I&#8217;ve done that much. </span>There are so many other people that have worked on diversity in tech, too. There are so many people that have been a part of this crowd agitating for change. It feels unfair to me that I get the attention that I do. But if I have the stage, I’m going to try to use it.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the negative side—</span>I&#8217;ve been pretty lucky to not have had any serious incidents of stalking or harassment, only a couple of cases. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re that bad, although I&#8217;ve had people tell me, &#8220;It&#8217;s not normal to have stalkers at all. The fact that you&#8217;ve had to go to the police before is not normal.&#8221;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> But it hasn&#8217;t been that bad.</span></p>\n<p><b>Wow. It&#8217;s funny that we feel that it&#8217;s totally normal, because we have perspective from these other women in the industry who have gone through things a thousand times worse.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, yeah. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve only had, like, two stalkers.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><b>Oh, man. Back to what you were just talking about earlier—you&#8217;ve written about being Asian in tech, and how sometimes the Asian population can be put in a bit of an awkward place in discussions around racism and discrimination. I&#8217;d love to hear more on that.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The topic has been wearing on me a bit as I’ve heard so much talk about issues of race and racial diversity in tech, people insisting that we need more people of color in tech—but Asians are so conveniently left out. There are plenty of Asians in tech, and we are people of color. Somehow in the tech context, though, we don’t count. It’s only Blacks or Latin@s. That’s such a strange oversight to me. Sure, Asians are overrepresented in tech, and yes, we complicate the conversation. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be a part of the conversation.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been pretty lucky to not have had any serious incidents of stalking or harassment, only a couple of cases. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re that bad, although I&#8217;ve had people tell me, &#8216;It&#8217;s not normal to have stalkers at all. The fact that you&#8217;ve had to go to the police before is not normal.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we back out to a larger conversation of Asians in America, perhaps the first thing to talk about is the model minority myth. We’re expected to be hardworking and good at science and nerdy things. In theory this sets us up for success in tech. But this model minority myth is dangerous. It was originally constructed as a tool of anti-Black racism in response to the civil rights movements of the 60s, setting apart Asians as a community of color that has succeeded due to our work ethic and good character (and thus implicating Blacks as responsible for their own inability to pull themselves out of poverty and crime). It cleaves apart communities of color in a way that props up white dominance and supremacy. And it’s also not actually that great for Asians. Part of the stereotype of Asians is that we’re good rank-and-file employees but not good leaders, and that’s borne out in the numbers. We’re overrepresented in the lower ranks and underrepresented in executive roles; there’s definitely a bamboo ceiling. And if we go back to intersectionality, the expectations on Asian women are even more constraining than those on Asian men. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you can tell, I’m kind of all over the place on this subject as I&#8217;m still trying to feel out the relevant themes in the conversation.</span></p>\n<p><b>I think that most people don&#8217;t even know the complexities whatsoever. I didn&#8217;t know the term “bamboo ceiling” until I did this project and saw the term in my submissions.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s also really important that Asians get involved in the conversations around having more Black and Latin@ people in tech instead of being complicit in racism against them.</span></p>\n<p><b>Kind of in the same realm, do people make assumptions about you based on what you look like—being race, gender, fashion, demeanor?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. It was much more so the case earlier in my career. Maybe partly because I was younger and not as far along in my career and fewer people knew who I was.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had the experience once of going to a conference (PyCon) and people not taking me seriously when I was wearing a dress and looked feminine—they assumed I worked in recruiting—but then engaging me in technical conversation when I showed up the next day in a t-shirt and jeans. Another time I went to a woman’s meetup and when I mentioned to someone I had worked at Quora and was then at Pinterest, her first response to that bit of information was to ask, “Are you the community manager?” Not to say that there’s anything wrong with recruiting or community management, but it’s frustrating for those of us in engineering to be always assumed to not be in engineering. </span></p>\n<p>Each of these experiences isn’t so significant in of itself, but repeated over and over it’s that feeling of death by a thousand papercuts.</p>\n<p><b>Yeah, I get it. Even in photography, I have people assume that I&#8217;m not the photographer.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s so frustrating.</span></p>\n<p><b>Have you had mentors or people that you&#8217;ve looked up to for inspiration?</b></p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have mentors in the classical sense of the word, although there are people that I&#8217;ve found resonance with, in specific aspects of their identity and success. The closest I’ve had to a mentor is probably my mom: She was a software engineer, and so she just was an example of what I could become. And that was very powerful.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few years ago people used to ask me this question a lot. “Do you have any mentors?” And it was usually a binary choice. “Sheryl or Marissa?” I never really identified with either of them very much. Sheryl’s not technical. Marissa was technical but never worked as an engineer either. And she has made statements to the effect of, “I don’t think that I would consider myself a feminist,” and denied the role of gender in the modern world, which is very baffling to me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One person that I really admire is Megan Smith. Not a mentor, but definitely someone I look to for inspiration. She’s a badass MIT-trained engineer and has held a number of important leadership roles; she’s very motivated by impact and has done a lot of great work with Google and now in the government. And she&#8217;s very compelling in calling people to action in a way that conveys urgency but not shame.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are your biggest motivators?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My biggest motivation is a sense of moral responsibility in taking advantage of all the privilege and advantages I&#8217;ve had to make the world a better place. I know that’s very vague and not prescriptive at all, but I’m trying to turn that motivation into something real. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was lucky to be born in America and to grow up here in the Bay Area, in a middle class family, with parents that valued education and let me focus on my education and not worry about anything else. I was lucky again in being able to attend Stanford and to have all the compounding privileges from that. Good internships, good career opportunities, the right networks. I didn’t deserve all of what I’ve been given but it’s not like I can give it back. All I can do is try to pay it forward. </span></p>\n<p><b>Similarly, I feel like you do a lot to give back to the community, and when did that become particularly important to you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It became most important to me after I&#8217;d had a series of not-great experiences, felt very alone and unsupported, and didn&#8217;t know where to turn. I was seriously considering quitting tech. And that’s despite the fact that I love software engineering. I love coding. I love building things. The job is a great match for my skill set, and there’s a lot of market demand for software engineers. Even so, I was really close to leaving. And I imagine there are a lot of others—actually, I know that there are a lot of others—who’ve had the same sort of frustrating experiences that I had. I just want to help make it so fewer people have to go through that. </span></p>\n<p><b>How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of diversity in tech, we still have a long way to go. We&#8217;re trying to make that difficult transition from awareness of issues to commitment to action. </span>Commitment is more than a blog post saying, &#8220;We care about diversity and here are our numbers.&#8221; But it&#8217;s hard to make diversity a priority because it&#8217;s a long-term strategy. It&#8217;s not something the companies see the benefits of immediately. Teams don’t suddenly more innovative as soon as a woman or black person is added to the mix. So in the face of short-term prioritization, companies are often unwilling to commit to diversity.</p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in five or ten years? Do you think you&#8217;ll still be here?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hope so! I don&#8217;t know exactly what I&#8217;ll be doing, but I hope that I&#8217;ll be using the power of software to help alleviate issues of social injustice. Again, very non-prescriptive. But I think there’s a lot of opportunity to apply tech to these problems that haven’t traditionally been the focus of the tech industry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s that criticism of Silicon Valley startups, that they’re focused solving one problem: “What is my mother no longer doing for me?” And they’re getting so much funding and attention! Some of the criticism is fair, I think. </span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. There are many many many people in the industry—a lot of which I&#8217;m interviewing for this—that know the potential that tech can make on real, significant problems outside of Silicon Valley.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We definitely are starting to see more of those companies. They&#8217;re not as flashy, not as sexy, but so important. Just for a few examples: There’s Honor, which is helping to provide elder care. And I was just talking to someone last weekend whose company is using data science to map out gas leaks from pipelines and to provide that information back to drilling companies. They’re addressing the problem of climate change through data science.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Commitment is more than a blog post saying, &#8216;We care about diversity and here are our numbers.&#8217; But it&#8217;s hard to make diversity a priority because it&#8217;s a long-term strategy. It&#8217;s not something the companies see the benefits of immediately. Teams don’t suddenly more innovative as soon as a woman or black person is added to the mix. So in the face of short-term prioritization, companies are often unwilling to commit to diversity.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>I feel like, keeping talent in tech is just as hard as recruiting it in the first place. So what do you think tech can do currently to prevent folks from leaving?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a hard problem since it&#8217;s not that there&#8217;s just one thing that&#8217;s wrong. It&#8217;s a whole culture that&#8217;s broken, we have to change the culture, and culture change is hard. Recently I&#8217;ve been trying to read up on different social movements, like the civil rights movement, to understand how those have played out and where they’ve seen success and failure. But even for the Black community, after decades of civil rights activism, there’s so much left to do. Just take a look at our system of mass incarceration that is essentially systemic racism. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But to get back to the specific question of tech, what companies can do to start addressing retention issues—going back to the metrics—is to measure everything and to understand where the problems lie. Google, for example, measures everything and they have a whole people analytics team that’s looking at this kind of data. They saw that there was an attrition problem with new moms and introduced a more generous maternity leave policy. When they did that, attrition dropped by 50 percent. The data is clearly going to be very useful in informing policy decisions within companies. </span></p>\n<p><b>And lastly, what advice would you give to folks who may be able to relate to you in some ways that are hoping to get into tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tech industry may be simultaneously easier and harder than you might expect to get into. On the one hand, something like software engineering is really just a trade skill, something you can pick up if you are interested and put in the time. On the other hand, the culture and values and processes that define the industry right now aren’t always very conducive to inclusivity and it can be difficult to navigate. But being in tech is about building the future of the world we live in, and it’s worth it. </span></p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I grew up in this really janky town called Fontana, which they nicknamed Fontucky, which pretty much sums it up.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It was a really rough and tumble part of the inland empire, and I spent most of my young years there and remember it pretty fondly, although there was definitely a lot of racial tension out there.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I grew up in this really janky town called Fontana, which they nicknamed Fontucky, which pretty much sums it up.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In elementary school, we moved to this place called Chino. If you’ve ever watched the OC, Chino is “the other side of the tracks.” There were a lot of Hispanic, African American, and Asian gangs out there. I grew up really into skateboarding and punk rock, and that was my way of being outside of all that stuff. I still had a lot of friends that were involved gang different gangs and I remember seeing the older high school people get into a lot of trouble, which had a big impact on the younger generation. But also still having this thing that was my own, which was skateboarding, music, and my friends. We still got into our share of trouble, but were luckily on the edge of a lot of the really bad stuff that was happening around us. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I grew up in a musical family. My mom is a singer; she sang in church. My grandmother was a pretty amazing multi-instrumentalist back in the Philippines. She sang, played violin, and piano and all of that. My brother played music growing up; he was a pianist and violinist. My dad was a guitarist. He&#8217;d do rock and roll guitar, and was super into Santana and the Beatles. He used to play in rock bands in the Philippines and they’d ditch school just to play music and stuff which is where I got it from, the DNA. I was definitely the nerdy band kid playing saxophone in marching band, but that influenced my musical taste because I started getting more into jazz music through the saxophone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started playing a lot of jazz because it was stimulating for me mentally, and my curiosity was piqued the more that I got into the technical aspects of music. But then there is this raw emotional side of music that, listening to punk-rock and stuff also satisfied for me. There are two separate things that attracted me to these kind of polar opposite types of music, and I think resonated with me as this person who lived in two worlds.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Many of my friends were really into gangs and drugs, getting into a lot of trouble. I was never into that, but I definitely tagged along and got into loose mischievous things. Some of them went to jail, and it just didn&#8217;t end up well for them.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the time I got to high school, Chino had now split into two parts, and this new city had formed called Chino Hills. It was this old part of town that used to be cow pastures and stuff, but it became this weird middle-class and yuppy part of town. But we still lived in this part that was on the outskirts, I guess, but still a part of Chino Hills. The new high school was this weird mix of suburban yuppie kids, but also other kids from Hispanic neighborhoods. Everyone from the surrounding area went there since it was the only school around. That was a funny, interesting time, because all of these other little subculture started to emerge. It&#8217;s a lot different than it is now because you had to meet people with similar interests. That&#8217;s how you discovered music and cults and all that. There wasn&#8217;t the internet or Facebook groups. I definitely gravitated toward those more outcast, black sheep type of people. I played in ska and reggae bands, and played some rockabilly music too, but still in the jazz band in high school. It was a big part of my life. </span></p>\n<p><b>It seems like a really positive childhood experience, considering how rough it was where you grew up. Like you were super curious and hobby-focused.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, definitely—when something piques my interest I get obsessive about it, and that drives me—I get tunnel vision and that really is the thing that just encompasses all of my time. And I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s the stuff that kept me out of the really dark parts of where I grew up. Like, my parents and I were not on the same page, if you know what I mean. They&#8217;re super religious, Filipino Catholics. My brother and I weren’t super close. We&#8217;re like two totally different people. I think we were close when we were really young, but I think the older he got, like Jr high school, we didn&#8217;t really hang out at the time, because he&#8217;s 4 years older than me. By the time I got to high school, he&#8217;d graduated and he went to the military. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of my friends were really into gangs and drugs, getting into a lot of trouble. I was never into that, but I definitely tagged along and got into loose mischievous things. Some of them went to jail, and it just didn&#8217;t end up well for them.</span></p>\n<p><b>Take me on the journey from that to getting into tech.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was still really obsessed with music. I studied Jazz composition as well as recording engineering right after high school. I thought that&#8217;s what I was going to do, so I got a degree in recording engineering. After that, I started working in a small studio on Melrose. That was interesting because I was still relatively young,maybe 19, 20 when I was doing that. I was working for other artists. I was tracking their sessions and it was really weird because I think one of my main clients was this group of Pasadena Blood gangster rappers. They would pack the studio and just get insanely stoned and argue over stupid stuff. I was just not into that music. It was just a weird mix and I was like, why am I in here recording their sessions. It was still a good experience, and really good exposure to something different.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>For a good three or four months, I was interviewing relentlessly. It was before web design was super prominent, so I had a physical portfolio full of books and printed pieces and I just talked to anyone that would check out my work or even give me some advice. I&#8217;d say I had maybe thirty or forty interviews in this short time span.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clinton_(musician)\" target=\"_blank\">George Clinton</a> was the main cash cow for the studio. Whenever he would come in, he would kick out whoever was in their at the time so they could record, but I got to spend some time in some of their sessions. Basically, they’d just get blitzed and then turn on the microphones, and then just creating this weird mix of sound that was part babble and part music. Long story short, I was about to have a kid and the music biz wasn’t cutting it. My girlfriend was 19 at the time, freshly out of high school. I was 20 or 21—and I decided that I needed to step it up. Being young and naive, I thought, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;ll go to art school,&#8221; thinking that would be better. I went to the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena and took fine arts, printmaking, as well as environmental design. My passion in terms of design, was the built space. So once I graduated there, I was pretty adamant about not going into tech. In early 2000, web design was really hadn’t caught up to traditional forms of graphic design, and you didn&#8217;t have a lot of control. Being very classically trained as a designer, you just—in those early days—were like, &#8220;Oh, God. I don&#8217;t even want to touch the web. It&#8217;s pretty atrocious.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started working in the <a href=\"http://www.getty.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Getty Museum</a> as an exhibition designer. I did interior architecture, environmental graphic design, and furniture. It was lots of fun working in an academic space, with very low consequences in the sense that I&#8217;m designing educational exhibits about historic art, or famous people, or just bodies of work. It was the best place for me to learn my craft and I was able to explore all different mediums. But the pay was shitty, and having a newborn child and working in a museum&#8230;I knew it would be a fun opportunity, but I couldn&#8217;t do it forever. It&#8217;s crazy for me to see people there for 10-20 years. Just thinking how they lived off that salary, because I wasn&#8217;t getting paid anything and and could&#8217;ve made more working in retail or doing something like that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">San Francisco was always a special place for me. It&#8217;s like my second home away from Los Angeles. And I&#8217;d gotten so burnt out from sitting in traffic and just grinding it out in LA, that I thought that I would try to move up to the Bay area. And once I made that decision, then I just came up here and pounded the pavement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a good three or four months, I was interviewing relentlessly. It was before web design was super prominent, so I had a physical portfolio full of books and printed pieces and I just talked to anyone that would check out my work or even give me some advice. I&#8217;d say I had maybe thirty or forty interviews in this short time span.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Then, one of my friends that I went to school with that was a little bit older than me got a job at Google. He was the first brand guy there. So I met with him, and then I met with someone at Facebook. I think that was actually kind of serendipitous because my portfolio had nothing to do with tech, it was all environmental design. But I think some of them had gone to the Getty and seen an exhibit, and I told them that I designed it, and it was like, &#8220;Oh my God, that was a great exhibit.&#8221; I think that&#8217;s how I caught their eye, because I just applied through a random ad on some kind of job listing site. I didn&#8217;t have any ambitions of going into tech, per se, but I thought Facebook would be an interesting gig, and all the people that I met were these really idealistic young entrepreneurial types, and they really sold me on the opportunity at Facebook. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All my friends were like, &#8220;Facebook sounds like a horrible job, why would you work there?&#8221; Especially going from the Getty, which is this Mecca if you&#8217;re into high design or whatever.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But again, I just couldn&#8217;t live like that. It was just really bad. Facebook didn&#8217;t have a brand per say, it was much smaller than Myspace. I think Friendster was still around at that time. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly it just seemed a lot easier for me to get my family up here through Facebook. Also there was this opportunity to build a brand at a consumer internet company that I don’t think had really been done super successfully before then. That&#8217;s kind of what got me up to the Bay area—happenstance. Not even looking for tech, jobs but just looking for a job in a city that I was really interested in living in.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All my friends were like, &#8220;Facebook sounds like a horrible job, why would you work there?&#8221; Especially going from the Getty, which is this Mecca if you&#8217;re into high design or whatever.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But again, I just couldn&#8217;t live like that.

How big was Facebook at the time?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We had just opened our fifth office which was in New York. It was New York, Chicago, and a couple of random cities in the United States. Five offices, most of those people were sales people. So I would say it was maybe 400-500 people. In terms of design, the design team was still really small—definitely less than 10, maybe 7 or 8 people. Engineering was rather large but product design was a tiny little team.</span></p>\n<p><b>Was your role defined as soon as you got there? Or was it just up to you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There wasn&#8217;t a bunch of projects waiting for me there. I think I asked my manager at the time what I should be working on, and he just pointed to some people across the room and was like—“go talk to them and see what they&#8217;re doing.” He encouraged me to put myself out there and start seeing where I could dive in and have the most impact. Which was something super foreign to me because working in an exhibition design studio—especially the Getty Museum—they have their exhibits planned out probably a decade in advance to be honest with you. They&#8217;re like, we know what we&#8217;re doing 5 years from now in August. So it&#8217;s kind of like a machine there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Facebook I had no idea what I was doing. I knew that I would be focusing on communication design and more of the brand aspects of it, but I don’t even think we knew what that was at Facebook. It was still early in my career so I didn&#8217;t have any formulated opinions on it. It was this perfect storm of “just go with your gut and see what happens.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Walk me through some of your projects over the course of your tech career, they vary quite a bit. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Early on, I was kind of feeling my way out through the place and understanding the identity system, which wasn&#8217;t really apparent. It was a logotype, color, and basic stuff. But it didn&#8217;t have any voice in terms of the visual identity. In fact, we intentionally didn’t have a brand voice in the early days. I worked with some of the sales and marketing teams to create some of their collateral, like brochures, little handouts for sales events. And that&#8217;s how I started—a lot of those relatively small design tasks. Working with HR to do the employee benefit packets, stuff like that. After a while I think we started to just go for it and take the reins. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more the company grew, the more initiatives we started to realize were happening that were pretty large, at least for the company at that scale. Having some experience in environmental design, I took on some work doing their conferences. We did their first <a href=\"https://www.fbf8.com/\" target=\"_blank\">F8</a>, which is their developer&#8217;s conference. At the time, I think they had done one already, but it was relatively small in scale, and it was almost this popup thing. We had some insight on budget, and we had some direction on the content, but for the most part we had very little oversight in terms of how it was going to manifest physically.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>At Facebook I had no idea what I was doing. I knew that I would be focusing on communication design and more of the brand aspects of it, but I don’t even think we knew what that was at Facebook.

It was this perfect storm of “just go with your gut and see what happens.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So the other partner that I had at the time was this guy, <a href=\"http://benbarry.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Barry</a>. He and I were both similar, young and wide-eyed, hungry designers, and I think we just started making and designing and building things for this physical event. It was just the two of us alone in a warehouse with screen printing tables, assembling them ourselves, and people were just like “why are you doing that, why don&#8217;t you rent them.” And for us, no one was going to give us money to do this stuff, so we were just going to make them on the cheap, and we wanted this aesthetic to feel very DIY and handcrafted. Mainly just out of necessity, because if we had a bigger budget we would have spent more money to make it a little bit more elaborate. Most of it was just working with our hands and trying to bring this—it&#8217;s like this idea of what a hacker-based visual identity might look like. We were just trying things and making stuff. It was super fun. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For me, the biggest opportunity at Facebook was that we were building this product, but the story of the company was very focused on data, and privacy, and this young renegade CEO. Everyone forgot about what the product was enabling. Which was just communication with people and families—communities sharing information and really changing the way they they interacted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So early on, using film was one of our easiest ways to capture a lot of those stories, document them, and get them out there. We started doing small brand video projects. Then we started doing bigger product launches and creating narrative pieces around specific products. But then we also got into documenting human stories that were on Facebook, which for me was the most fun part of being there, getting to travel and hear about these communities and different people that were doing interesting things with Facebook, in some remote part of the world. A small crew of people shooting, editing, and creating this channel to deliver stories on behalf of the brand, was a really powerful thing for me. It was this big arc for me, thinking I was going to design web pages and ultimately doing these really big brand initiatives over the course of about five years.</span></p>\n<p><b>I think the Analog Research Lab is one of the coolest things I saw when I first visited Facebook&#8217;s campus, and you created it. How did that come about?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I mentioned the F8 conferences that we did early on — I would say that was the impetus for us to build a space to make stuff. We had this huge warehouse that was basically used for storage, and no one knew that we were in there. We just started making stuff in the corner. I think somehow we just weaseled access into the garage, and then they looked the other way and let us do whatever we wanted in there.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>For me, the biggest opportunity at Facebook was that we were building this product, but the story of the company was very focused on data, and privacy, and this young renegade CEO. Everyone forgot about what the product was enabling. Which was just communication with people and families—communities sharing information and really changing the way they they interacted.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We started bringing in our own supplies. I think the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/analoglab\" target=\"_blank\">Analog Research Lab</a> started with some homemade silkscreens and some power tools that we had that was our own personal equipment. We just started making and building in the space, and accumulating equipment over time. Officially made it a thing after these F8 conferences, once people saw some of the output, then we started working out of there more and more, Ben Barry and I. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before Ben Barry came to Facebook, he worked at a screen-printing studio in Austin called The Decoder Ring. I used to teach letterpress at Art Center before moving up here, in Pasadena. So we had this strong connection to the tactile and the physically made design stuff. And being in a world of engineers, and product, and web designers, it was a hyperdigital space. We just wanted to keep our hands dirty and still keep those skills sharp. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a way for us to break out of that very technological world. Then we bought some legit screen printing equipment. I found an old letterpress that I restored, and it&#8217;s still there today. We just started producing tons of hand-crafted stuff. Not just to make pretty things, but a lot of it was centered around the messages themselves. We were trying to bring the company&#8217;s values to life, but also use the lab as this provocateur inside the company. We would print posters, slogans of things that were in the air—sayings, or mantras—and we would commit them to paper.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fact that we were using these seemingly antiquated pieces of communication technology was very subtle; but it was conceptual for us in the sense that Facebook was building this communication platform which was a paradigm shift from all the different means of communications that existed. People didn&#8217;t see it in this trajectory of human communication; from cave paintings to scribes to the Gutenberg bible. All of these things increasingly ramped up the amount of information that people were producing and consuming. Facebook is no different. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My father used to work for Pacific Bell, the telephone company. There were payphones on every street. Now that I&#8217;m an adult, you can&#8217;t even find a payphone out here. That&#8217;s how fast these communication platforms are changing.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We just wanted to use the letters as a way to tie these things together. It wasn&#8217;t a project that was delivered to us or that was cued up for us. It was a passion and a very personal thing for us. That was how it took off. Once we moved to the current campus, we put it front and center. It became a landmark inside of the campus. It has a full staff now. There&#8217;s a shop manager and designers that work full time in there, but for us it was definitely a “nights and weekends” type of personally driven thing.</span></p>\n<p><strong>I love that it was a side project and it wasn’t necessarily in the realm of specialty that you were hired to work. You were pioneers for work culture that way. You guys started the posters-in-the-tech-office movement, I don’t know what else to call it. Who would have thought that something that didn’t feel necessary to a digital company or a digital product actually made ripples across all of tech?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. It&#8217;s pretty wild that now it&#8217;s all par-for-the-course, I guess. When I moved over to Pinterest, early on someone asked me, &#8220;Hey, can you make posters of some of our values?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No. I&#8217;m not going to do that. Not because I don&#8217;t want to do it but because I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s what we need.” We delivered an idea because that&#8217;s what Facebook needed at the time to catalyze the culture around these things. But Pinterest was different.</span></p>\n<p><strong>I want to go into Pinterest as well, but I’m curious about something. Just hearing you talk about your work—it’s so interesting that you worked in tech at a time when specialization was important. Yet you seem to have broken those rules all over the place. It’s so interesting to me that you were so successful at that and made so many impactful projects. Did people notice that you were all over the place, and were they okay with it? I’m just so curious as to how you were able to create that path of your own when it wasn’t normal.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t think at the time that people quite understood it, I don&#8217;t even think we understood it. We were just doing whatever we thought was important or whatever floated our boat at the time, I guess. I would say, in hindsight, it definitely has become a model. There were always marketing designers inside of companies, tech companies or not, but brand-focused designers were never really given the autonomy in tech companies the way that engineers and product designers were. There is still, like you mentioned, specialization. I think there are still a fair amount of generalists that they hired early on at Facebook. It could be because it was what the early team valued, and they knew that people who can do lots of different things are going to be able to move the needle more in that very malleable time. I&#8217;d say now it&#8217;s very specialized. You need to be a certain type of designer or engineer on a specific platform.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>My father used to work for Pacific Bell, the telephone company. There were payphones on every street. Now that I&#8217;m an adult, you can&#8217;t even find a payphone out here. That&#8217;s how fast these communication platforms are changing.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would say even though my work is seemingly diverse, when you look at an exhibition, or video, or whatever, a digital piece, there&#8217;s still a central trend which is around narrative and storytelling. I think that comes through in a lot of work, and being thoughtful about the strategy—if I were to describe the specialty that I bring, it&#8217;s probably more on the strategic side of brand. Most people only see the output, and they see my portfolio and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Wow, you do all kinds of different stuff.&#8221; It&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t start with an output. I&#8217;m not a video person, I&#8217;m not an environmental designer. Those are appropriate mediums for whatever objective I&#8217;m trying to accomplish. Having that approach gave me the flexibility, but also still tied all that stuff together. Now I think there is a model for that inside of a tech company. Although I still think it&#8217;s hard for companies to kind of wrangle them in. A lot of it is about the culture and the leadership, and how willing they are to give you autonomy, which is rare for a lot of companies.</span></p>\n<p><b>How was designing the new Facebook building with Frank Gehry?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever top that in my career, ever. That was the coolest thing I&#8217;ve ever done. I got to spend a lot of time with him. He&#8217;s in his 80s and he&#8217;s still the hardest working guy in the studio. He&#8217;s not doing all the grunt work, but he&#8217;s still a pretty active individual. Just being able to see the way that he works, which for me was pretty interesting, I say like most people that you think about, when they&#8217;re at a certain level like he is like, &#8220;Oh, this guy might be crazy cerebral or just really out there and different.&#8221; But he&#8217;s just the epitome of California cool, super laid back, but also still has this punk rock ethos, you know? </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more people that I work with and seeing them operating at the highest level of their field—that gives me hope for our industry.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Because there are definitely people that are super smart and crazy talented, but I think they make a thing out of being crazy smart and talented. Some like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gehry\" target=\"_blank\">Frank Gehry</a> do really cool shit, and if it fails, he&#8217;s still pushing himself to do better and more interesting and more unique stuff. That was the best part of my career.</span></p>\n<p><b>Then you went to Pinterest.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was just fun to get back into a smaller stage of a company, around something that was more personally relevant. A lot of the stuff I did at Facebook, from a superficial and aesthetic standpoint, probably would&#8217;ve worked better at Pinterest because it is this creative platform and there&#8217;s a lot of very specific things that we&#8217;re doing in the Analog Research Lab that actually worked well content-wise on Pinterest, like the DIY stuff. Not that I didn&#8217;t like the mission at Facebook. I think it&#8217;s pretty amazing, but being a creative individual, and going to art school, and always being connected to that, I think Pinterest brought me closer to my roots. I was around a bunch of people that were more like me.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>The more people that I work with and seeing them operating at the highest level of their field—that gives me hope for our industry.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pinterest has a much stronger personal relevance to me. I think that&#8217;s why the work that I was doing—even though it wasn&#8217;t necessarily at the scale of Facebook—there was always this this intimacy about it. It felt a little better to me because I would use this product pretty religiously.</span></p>\n<p><b>Across your time in tech, what have been your biggest hardships and the biggest obstacles for you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the one hand I love the autonomy and being able to try stuff and come to the table with ideas, but I still operate in a very structured way and if I don&#8217;t have a framework, then it&#8217;s really hard for me to move forward. I think that&#8217;s what a more traditional design setting gave me. We have this exhibit going out this day, and this is the process, and it enabled me to be hyper-creative in a very streamlined way. So the lack of that has been the biggest challenge. Theoretically, I should be the one imposing that stuff, but it&#8217;s not as straightforward as that. It&#8217;s a pretty fluid, yet tumultuous environment to begin with, and each company is trying to do something different, including building the company that they want. When you bring existing processes to the table, I think it takes a lot of energy to implement those things, because everyone&#8217;s pretty reluctant to in the beginning.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>When I first started at Facebook, I would find myself around people that were Ivy league or maybe had a lot of money. Part of me growing up in inland empire and the east side of Southern California just thinking, &#8220;How did I end up here?&#8221; It&#8217;s kind of crazy. It&#8217;s this conflict of money, class and upbringing that has been a weird struggle for me.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think culturally, it’s also been a challenge. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The culture of Bay Area Silicon Valley tech. I didn&#8217;t grow up like that, so I think it&#8217;s really weird for me, to be honest. Even now, having lived in the Bay Area for a good 10 years, there&#8217;s a side of me that sees all the money, and the crazy entitlement that goes around, and it really bums me out. It makes me not super excited about it anymore.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It got progressively more over time, but even </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when I first started at Facebook, I would find myself around people that were Ivy league or maybe had a lot of money.

How did you fit in, or feel like you fit in, in your early days in tech and even now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was hard and I would say what resonated with me was the entrepreneurial spirit of early Facebook. And I think if it wasn’t Facebook, I don&#8217;t think it would have worked so well for me. Mainly because they let me explore myself creatively. Not intentionally, they just were too busy doing their own thing, and I was still producing a fair amount of work that was having some impact. I was also able to do that in a space where I didn&#8217;t have a ton of oversight, which is super rare. A lot of the great designers that I look up to, seem to have a combination either a good patron, or a studio, or a client that allows them to take those risks, and I had that at Facebook. I always use that as a benchmark which for me is not the right way to do it because all the jobs after that, I&#8217;m like “oh man at Facebook it was so different.” But I realize that it was a time in my career that I&#8217;ll probably never be able to replicate. I mean, I shouldn&#8217;t try to, I should just let these other things be themselves, you know?</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>The culture of Bay Area Silicon Valley tech.

It makes me not super excited about it anymore.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I still have my family too, so that was the biggest thing because part of my life goals at the time were getting my family on their feet, and I was super determined. I think in many ways I just blocked out a lot of things. I had my eye on the prize for a long time, which was really hard to achieve, like getting out of debt, and owning a home, and the basic needs stuff. That&#8217;s really all that I cared about. I think everything else just kind of tuned out for a while.</span></p>\n<p><b>Were you one of the first parents at Facebook?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Definitely on the design team. It wasn&#8217;t until relatively recently that those people I was on the team with at the time started having children. Only a handful of them. I still see them in my Facebook feed and they&#8217;re posting newborn photos. My daughter&#8217;s a teenager now. She spent a lot of time with me at Facebook in the early days. She would come to work with me and hang out and I would just let her run around the office. She knows Mark and Sheryl. She&#8217;s seen all those people. For all she knew at the time, they could have worked for me. I&#8217;m like “no, that young guy over there is the boss of all of this stuff.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I tend to work early. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would take the Caltrain and get there super early in the morning. Sometimes at 6:00, 7:00 in the morning and be the first one there for a good 2 hours. But then people would want to meet at 6:00 at night. I&#8217;m like, “I got to go home. I got to eat dinner with the family,” and that was a struggle. But I didn&#8217;t feel like it was too much of a compromise. Everyone&#8217;s like, “why does he always leave early?” It wasn&#8217;t super early, it was just normal time, but they were a young crew of people that worked super-late. Now they know because they&#8217;re all having little babies and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;This is so hard,&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No shit, try doing it when you don&#8217;t have the financial means and the support network!&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><b>How do your friends and family from home feel about the work you&#8217;ve done and how you turned out?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think my parents are proud. Just being at Facebook, they assume that I&#8217;m a billionaire. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s a weird environment. And I think if you don&#8217;t live in the Bay Area or work in tech it&#8217;s so foreign. Even being inside of it you&#8217;re just like, &#8220;What is happening?&#8221; It&#8217;s such a weird thing. Each company is different and there&#8217;s all these different groups of people. Someone will write a book about this someday—but at this point in time, you kinda gotta be here to experience it.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in five or ten years? Do you see yourself still working in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t know if I see myself working in tech. My goal is definitely to have my own design practice. In five years my daughter will be in college, which, for me is crazy because we don&#8217;t have another kid and I&#8217;ll still be 40 years old. Relatively young in the sense of having a child that&#8217;s already out of the nest. That for me is pretty exciting, because we basically did our family life backwards. We had a kid early. We kind of grinded it out at work and got on our feet as a family. I didn&#8217;t spend my 20s dicking around going to clubs and stuff. Now I&#8217;m able to go out without freaking out about a babysitter. I&#8217;m starting to experience the city from a young adult&#8217;s eyes versus a parent&#8217;s eye, which is a new thing for my wife and I. If I&#8217;m able to travel and still have my own clientele and do stuff, that would be pretty amazing. I can’t say I won&#8217;t be in tech because I think most people are somehow tangentially connected to tech. Even if you&#8217;re freelancing as a designer, you might have a tech client, because that&#8217;s the predominant industry paying good money. I do see myself doing more music. That&#8217;s been number one on my list, trying to get a group people playing again. Also, doing more makerly things, like furniture design. Or make something physical and tangible versus working on a computer.</span></p>\n<p><b>What advice would you have for people from similar backgrounds who are hoping to get into tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess the philosophical side of me is saying: First examine your motives. Sometimes a problem isn’t in the motive, but in the fact that you have a motive at all. And I think for me, just being able to navigate these really weird situations at times, was because I felt like a conscious observer and I was trying to be really objective towards things. But I think, had I come in with a goal being monetary or superficial stuff, then I don&#8217;t know if tech would have worked well for me. So that&#8217;s probably my first advice, which I don&#8217;t even know if that&#8217;s advice. But if you&#8217;re following tech because that&#8217;s where the money is, or that&#8217;s seemingly the most fluid and flexible work environment, I&#8217;d say all of those things are superficial. Examine what it is that really motivates you and see how tech either gets you closer to that or doesn&#8217;t, and make a real decision.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Someone will write a book about this someday—but at this point in time, you kinda gotta be here to experience it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Tell me about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Early years. I was born in Youngstown, Ohio, which is this sleepy little steel town right on the border of Pennsylvania. My parents, who&#8217;ve been split since I was two, both got job offers at the same time in Florida and took it as kind of providence, and so the whole family moved down there. So my mom still lives in Orlando, and my dad lives in Tampa. Went to high school in Orlando, and then college in Florida. And eventually I to New York for grad school. Worked there a little bit. Bounced around the country a little bit. A few different places. And then wound up here in October. </span></p>\n<p><b>How’d you get into design and/or tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s interesting. So for undergrad, I studied politics. I didn&#8217;t think I was going into design at all and then started working in non-profits. This was right at the onset of the recession. So non-profits didn&#8217;t have the money to hire me to do anything, and they also didn&#8217;t have money to contract things like design. I had taught myself a little bit of Photoshop, and those were my first clients, where I was trying to build something to try and find ways to freelance and make money. I got into design from a perspective of wanting to do more social good projects, through more graphic design projects.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I knew San Francisco, culturally, was on a short list of places I always wanted to live someday, but I didn&#8217;t ever have it as a target. I felt like it was a little bit of a whirlpool, where eventually, all designers who work in tech, find their way to San Francisco, and some stay, and some get spit right back out and keep going.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn&#8217;t until I went back to school for grad school, to actually formally study design, that I realized I was actually also very interested in technology. I was particularly interested in the way that games were now doing these more interesting, immersive narratives, and how they were really reaching, when they were done right, doing these really amazing things that were on a level of novels, that were even beyond film, because you spend so much time in the game, versus a two-hour film. That interest in mediums and technology then started me doing more design work in that realm. </span></p>\n<p>I knew San Francisco, culturally, was on a short list of places I always wanted to live someday, but I didn&#8217;t ever have it as a target. I felt like it was a little bit of a whirlpool, where eventually, all designers who work in tech, find their way to San Francisco, and some stay, and some get spit right back out and keep going.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I knew a few friends in New York who felt that way, or were from San Francisco and were still trying to escape it as long as they could, paddling away. I didn&#8217;t really know what to expect.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;As a designer in New York, the design community is very much about—it&#8217;s still very much analog. Publishing is still the main realm of design there and fashion, and you find different kinds of specialties. But most of them are still clinging to the analog world. There&#8217;s actually not a lot of tech designers or people who are super-enthusiastic about it. Most of the people are still trying to make an Etsy shop or revive some kind of ancient typeface, and that&#8217;s fine. That&#8217;s really cool, but it wasn’t my thing by the time I was done with school.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>As a designer in New York, the design community is very much about—it&#8217;s still very much analog.

And I think I started to realize as I embraced the idea of moving out here that Silicon Valley might be the center of the universe for design and tech and that I might find more like-minded designers coming out here where I would be in the majority for once of most people like the technology side of things. And now the hipster typefaces are now on the fringes of the design world over here. And I think it&#8217;s more or less met that expectation. </span>I think I&#8217;ve been more thrown by the West Coast cultural values more so than anything about Silicon Valley itself, I guess.</p>\n<p><b>It&#8217;s definitely different from New York.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, very different. Although, I&#8217;ve heard that it&#8217;s not as different as it used to be. I was having this conversation with a friend not that long ago, and we were talking about how with the influx of New Yorkers it&#8217;s starting to kind of Manhattan-ize a little bit of San Francisco. And you can see it in certain neighborhoods where there&#8217;s still this kind of more hippy vibe of laidbackness. I lived in Austin for a while, and so my only comparison is to say that it&#8217;s just more of an Austin-y kind of neighborhood of more laid back people. So I feel like that has been the more surprising attention getting thing for me. More so than even any kind of preoccupation with my job, or the other people I work with, or anything.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah it&#8217;s definitely changed a lot since it&#8217;s become more of a melting pot from other cities.

Definite positive, and there&#8217;s actually places to eat after 9pm now.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. So it&#8217;s funny that I&#8217;m finding in myself that I&#8217;m building connections faster with people who are from New York. And I feel weird about it because I set an expectation of moving out here, and kind of embracing a different world for a little bit, and I feel myself, and I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s as I get older I&#8217;m less open to these kinds of new experiences, new places, and so I&#8217;m just being a little lazy, and gravitating towards people that remind me of places I&#8217;ve been before.</span></p>\n<p><b>I get it.</b></p>\n<p>I also feel weird because I feel like I am the cliche. I am the designer from New York coming to work at Airbnb, and that becomes this emblem of what problems ail the Mission and other neighborhoods. So I feel like whenever I hear people talking about Silicon Valley and San Francisco, I just kind of shut up and listen. I don&#8217;t feel qualified to comment yet on it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I also feel weird because I feel like I am the cliche.

What is really exciting to you about your work? What are things you&#8217;re super proud of, what are things that really activate you right now?</b></p>\n<p>I try to read a lot of philosophy actually, and I think I&#8217;m learning that that&#8217;s not usual for a lot of designers. A lot of designers are very interested in the aesthetics of things, and I&#8217;m really interested specifically in how the aesthetics influence behavior change. So the visuals are actually more of a means to an end for me. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In that realm you find all kinds of really interesting philosophical questions. It&#8217;s a shame that it goes over so many people&#8217;s heads, because I wish they were reading more of the stuff I&#8217;m stumbling across.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I try to read a lot of philosophy actually, and I think I&#8217;m learning that that&#8217;s not usual for a lot of designers.

So the visuals are actually more of a means to an end for me.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some things I&#8217;m interested about that make me so interested in this topic are things like Sherry Turkle, she was an MIT roboticist. She wrote this relatively cynical view of the way machinery is actually changing human behavior in cognitively lazy ways, which is interesting, again because she&#8217;s an MIT roboticist. For her to have a cynical view on tech makes you turn your head and listen to what she has to say. And then I like going into other stuff, like Umberto Eco talks about hyper-realities and these layers of reality on top of the real thing and all the moral quandaries in this. When you work in tech you are, in many cases, building a virtual version of things that&#8211; you&#8217;re not blind, you look around when you&#8217;re side and everyone&#8217;s on their phones and you&#8217;re building that &#8211; as Baudrillard would have called it &#8211; like the kind of map on top of the real world. You&#8217;re building that virtual on top of the real. So I think those, </span>because of moral problems which I&#8217;m not always feeling like I&#8217;m on the right side of sometimes, also keep it interesting in a kind of “hard questions to answer kind of way” that make me kind of get up every morning and keep doing it.</p>\n<p><b>Yeah, it makes sense to me that you&#8217;re feeling this way—as someone who&#8217;s lived in New York City, we have a heavy specialization culture here compared to there. In my experience, knowing about other disciplines were considered detractors from your specialty. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interesting.</span></p>\n<p><b>Being a generalist of any kind was frowned upon for a while. And so going to New York which is so not a one industry town, and how it was wildly different in that way. In New York, it was more like &#8220;Oh, what do you do? Okay, what else do you do, what other projects do you work on, what else are you into?&#8221; And I notice how that mentality affects the two cities tech cultures differently.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can see that totally being a factor too, just like their density, right? Because there&#8217;s so many design tech workers here, they started to have to specialize to keep steady work, or to find their niche, or whatever. And in New York, again being on the fringes a designer in tech, you couldn&#8217;t always count on tons of design tech work, so you were probably pulling other skill sets to kind of stay afloat during all that. I could see that being a factor. New York in general though, I think just from the way it&#8217;s built, down to its demographic makeup, is just this collision of all kinds of crazy ideas, that&#8211; maybe you&#8217;re right, maybe it&#8217;s like a cultural thing that forces everyone to be a little bit more of a generalist there.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The latest project I worked on, been working on it for about four months, and for the first three months I didn&#8217;t design a single thing. It was a lot of me leading up to the idea of the project, me working with content strategists, me working with researchers, me sorting through data sciences, tons and tons of previous experiments they&#8217;d run. There&#8217;s just a lot of immersion in all of the different things around the thing before I actually set pen to paper to make something. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s typical of other designers yet; it doesn&#8217;t seem to be. I feel like other people are rushed into making something and they don&#8217;t fight back, and so they do that. Whereas I&#8217;m a little bit more opinionated about how I want to do it, and I&#8217;ll usually fight for that time before something actually gets made.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Yeah. How do you think that background impacts the way you create your work here?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m slower [laughter]. Because I take in time to weave and detour and walk away from my desk for a while, and think about it, or read something and let it see how it kind of shapes my opinion of something. I&#8217;ve only been here since October, so I&#8217;m still kind of getting that sense of how it&#8217;s going to shape what I do. I think I&#8217;m more likely to write an essay on why I&#8217;m taking a design approach than I am to quickly and quietly say what I&#8217;m presenting today. It can only really compare to how I&#8217;ve seen other designers in my office talk about their work. For example, </span>the latest project I worked on, been working on it for about four months, and for the first three months I didn&#8217;t design a single thing. It was a lot of me leading up to the idea of the project, me working with content strategists, me working with researchers, me sorting through data sciences, tons and tons of previous experiments they&#8217;d run. There&#8217;s just a lot of immersion in all of the different things around the thing before I actually set pen to paper to make something.

Whereas I&#8217;m a little bit more opinionated about how I want to do it, and I&#8217;ll usually fight for that time before something actually gets made.</p>\n<p><b>Which makes sense when you are designing for a complex problem involving a lot of people.</b></p>\n<p class=\"body_text\">And this is a relatively simple environment. I worked at IBM before which has massive systems at scale; it&#8217;s impossible to really ever feel like you&#8217;ve solved a problem. The job that I just most recently was working was in mobile advertising, so we&#8217;re talking about a moment, just a microinteraction to design. So I&#8217;ve seen all sides of that from a fraction of someone&#8217;s attention to tons and tons of people involved in the system. And so this doesn&#8217;t even feel as if it&#8217;s particularly hard in either one of those directions. When I get my way I get to spend lots of time thinking about something before I move on it, but you don&#8217;t always get the luxury.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"body_text\">&#8220;I&#8217;ve moved quite a bit for different jobs. And the last year or so that&#8217;s started to catch up to me where I wonder how that&#8217;s affecting my relationships.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><b>What have been some of your biggest struggles and roadblocks over the course of your career?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Struggles and roadblocks. It&#8217;s been some interesting ones. </span>I&#8217;ve moved quite a bit for different jobs. And the last year or so that&#8217;s started to catch up to me where I wonder how that&#8217;s affecting my relationships.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> All my friends here even, who have lived here for ten years, and they have such deep roots with so many people and even when you move you stay in contact with some people, but even as close as you might feel when you live in the same city once you disconnect a little bit over time that all decays. And I realize that I don&#8217;t have a lot friends beyond the last two or three years just because, after you move around a couple of times you lose touch. So I feel like my job is kind of impacted. That&#8217;s been a challenge of the job. </span>If you&#8217;re chasing the next best thing that&#8217;s always being offered to you, as exciting and as fun as it is to get better at what you do, and be doing more and more of what you love, you’re making all kinds of small sacrifices along the way that add up over time.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re chasing the next best thing that&#8217;s always being offered to you, as exciting and as fun as it is to get better at what you do, and be doing more and more of what you love, you’re making all kinds of small sacrifices along the way that add up over time.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;ve been weird ones too like; when I moved to Austin for IBM, it was before the Supreme Court had passed the gay rights legislation last year. So that was a weird one because </span>I was living in New York where I could marry or date or hold hands out in public and never really think twice about it, and I got used to it after a couple years living there and then getting a job offer in Texas was the first time I was like, &#8220;Oh, I have to actually give this up.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t think it would  be as big of a deal until I got there. It really kind of messed with me for a while. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually, that was what I went to IBM with and said, &#8220;You moved me away from the state where I could be me and now I&#8217;m like a half citizen here. Especially in Austin at the time the governor was comparing homosexuality to alcoholism. And that&#8217;s two years ago, this is not like an exceptional amount of time. It was eventually why they let me move back to New York from Austin. So there&#8217;s been little things like that for my jobs and careers and stuff like that for a while not all the states were equal and you couldn&#8217;t just move to wherever the opportunities were. You had other things to consider. Luckily that didn&#8217;t last too long for me.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was living in New York where I could marry or date or hold hands out in public and never really think twice about it, and I got used to it after a couple years living there and then getting a job offer in Texas was the first time I was like, &#8220;Oh, I have to actually give this up.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t think it would  be as big of a deal until I got there. It really kind of messed with me for a while.</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Yeah I&#8217;m from North Carolina and with their recent politics I can&#8217;t help but be like, &#8220;You guys are fucking yourself talent-wise.” </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It really was a thing. IBM had set up this office in Austin because it was so much cheaper. Texas has done all these great business incentives to move these kinds of big companies to startup centers like that there. It was a weird place to try and recruit a designer because even though Austin&#8217;s great it&#8217;s still Texas. So it&#8217;s not exactly near any design mecca&#8217;s to draw people in. I remember that was something that cost them. I wasn&#8217;t the only person there was other people I know too that would struggle. People they were trying to recruit were like “Why would I move there if I can&#8217;t be who I am? What&#8217;s the point?” That was kind of eye opening. For a while there things were kind of half and half. So I&#8217;m glad that it didn&#8217;t last very long.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Regarding tech, it&#8217;s interesting because statistically gay men are paid less than average, but gay women are paid more. It comes down to body language. If they&#8217;re more effeminate, they&#8217;re paid more like women and when lesbian women act more masculine they&#8217;re paid more like men which is kind of still a sad commentary on why that&#8217;s even a thing that we pay differently.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Now being in San Francisco, what&#8217;s your experience been as a gay designer?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m a cliche now. [Laughter] I feel like you get into any kind of Lyft-sharing experience and you talk to the other passenger and they’re like, “I work at Facebook,” and you’re like “I work at Airbnb.” It&#8217;s almost nauseating sometimes how many people are working in similar spaces. It&#8217;s funny because if you remember it&#8217;s kind of what I asked for. I wanted to be around like minded designers. The gay culture in general is funny here in San Francisco. It&#8217;s different in a lot of ways. </span>Regarding tech, it&#8217;s interesting because statistically gay men are paid less than average, but gay women are paid more. It comes down to body language. If they&#8217;re more effeminate, they&#8217;re paid more like women and when lesbian women act more masculine they&#8217;re paid more like men which is kind of still a sad commentary on why that&#8217;s even a thing that we pay differently.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So I feel like also that gay people in general, because of the stigmas they&#8217;ve grown up with and depending on their homelife as they came out and all those different factors, like it&#8217;s a more, I don&#8217;t know—I feel like you see fewer gay men aggressively pursuing a career, becoming super successful. Like you find much more of a mixed bag, I feel like. And so, as a gay design tech worker, I feel like I&#8217;m kind of in a different bubble from other people. I don&#8217;t know. I suppose it&#8217;s no different than like any other kind of straight relationship or groups or something like that. But it is kind of its own little bubble, and again, this is more of a San Francisco thing, that like </span>tech workers aren&#8217;t always super welcome depending on the party, depending on the group of people, and so you can sometimes feel a little weird. And in an environment where being gay should be like the unifying thing that keeps everyone in the group feeling close to one another, that can actually be kind of an undertone of a kind of rift in the room sometimes which is weird. That was not a thing in New York. There was no industry that was hated or like despised. And New York has some slimy industries like Wall Street and stuff there and there was still nothing like Airbnb that could divide gays. It’s more political here and that often trumps sexual orientation.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Tech workers aren&#8217;t always super welcome depending on the party, depending on the group of people, and so you can sometimes feel a little weird.

Tech and the queer community?</b></p>\n<p class=\"body_text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s weird. Like when you&#8217;d posted your call for subjects for this project, and there was one question about something like you were interested in things like minority backgrounds, or stories, or something like that. And that&#8217;s always such a funny thing, because </span>I remember coming out and someone saying something to me about being a minority, or something like that. It was bizarre because I came out—I was 21 I think—and for 21 years I was a white male. I was the most privileged demographic in human history. I never thought I was being discriminated against for anything except for unfair advantage [chuckles]. And so then to suddenly come out, I was suddenly in a different group that was very marginalized. But I feel like I get it easy, because even there I&#8217;m not especially effeminate where that might be something that- it&#8217;s rare that someone from across the room is like, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re gay&#8221; and then I have to work with that. I can kind of go incognito if I want to, or need to, or something like that. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So it&#8217;s not out of my control to control those kinds of stigmas sometimes. I still don&#8217;t fully identify as a minority. I feel my advantages still far outweigh any kind of setbacks and I think I was fortunate enough to live in a time where all of these things were rolling back. I mean, we forget, but 2007 and 2008 had huge bands happening across the country, and all of that reversed 180 degrees in a few years. I happen to have had my career rise at a time where all that was very quickly becoming normal. And so I don&#8217;t think that actually hurt me as bad as it certainly would have hurt other people even 10 years ago. Now we have Tim Cook head of Apple. So the stigmas I have to deal with are fading fast.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"body_text\">&#8220;I remember coming out and someone saying something to me about being a minority, or something like that.

How does that work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, it&#8217;s funny, some jobs I tell right off the bat, and some I don&#8217;t. I told Airbnb right off the bat, because the last one I tried to keep it a secret. It was almost as a game to see how long I could go before it was obvious. And I made it through the whole time I was there, and I never told anyone. In fact, I teach at General Assembly, </span>I teach Visual Design and there&#8217;s actually a whole class that&#8217;s going to be next week on color theory, and I&#8217;ve taught that every single time without ever telling the class that I&#8217;m colorblind.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So you can get by. I think some people misunderstand colorblindness. I see probably see like, 70-80% the same thing that everyone else does, so it&#8217;s not as dramatic. So it&#8217;s really only a couple of shades that as long as I avoid trying to call out that green button, or that blue text, when it&#8217;s actually purple or actually red or something like that, I can get by just fine. But there&#8217;s actually a host of like digital tools nowadays that make having to verbalize a color or something kind of unnecessary.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I teach Visual Design and there&#8217;s actually a whole class that&#8217;s going to be next week on color theory, and I&#8217;ve taught that every single time without ever telling the class that I&#8217;m colorblind.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p class=\"body_text\"><b>You can just talk in hex code or something.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exactly, with a lot of designers, it&#8217;s like a hex code that you are just copying and pasting anyway or even a Pantone that you are just memorizing the number of. And I even can take the hex code and if I just Google like “What color is this…”, there&#8217;s a website but I can&#8217;t remember the name of it that always pops up top, and I go in there and I can paste the hex code in it and it actually describes the color too. And so it will give me description and it will say this is the shade of yellow. And so if I am working within a palette that I know I&#8217;m going to be using a lot, I can almost always sense their balance to one another without having to see the exact, exact shade. But if I’m ever on the fence because it&#8217;s some kind of weird in-between color, I can always look it up that way and save myself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s only one bad time that I actually worked with Milton Glazer in New York, which is an amazing opportunity. But he did a famous, very iconic Bob Dylan poster with, you know, the silhouette of Bob Dylan, all these really colorful wacky hair. And he had it in his archive the original one and he was talking about how they needed to re-evaluate the colors for some kind of new print job they were going to do to reprint it. He asked me. He said, &#8220;Can you go down to the cellar, get the poster out, and I need you to kind of match pantone colors so that we can reprint this.&#8221; and I immediately started to panic and have anxiety, because that is the absolute worst—that is the number one thing as a designer that I still could never do is take a color wheel and match exact shades, especially for such an iconic reprint of such a big work and, thank God, before I had to answer this, one of his other assistants said, &#8220;Oh, no, I did that last week.&#8221; And she had the notes and I slumped back into my seat. That would have been bad I would have had to admit that to him. I don&#8217;t know how he would have reacted.</span></p>\n<p><b>Oh, man. I think back on how many meetings I sat in in tech deciding—spending so much time over the difference—like the tiniest difference between shades of salmon.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Totally, yeah.</span></p>\n<p><b>Salmon.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would have a harder time in like a branding agency where you&#8217;re coming up with brand new color pallets, but because I&#8217;ve usually worked in like in-house teams where you have a brand and you have colors to work with—and even at Airbnb we have a graphic design department where they specialize in visual design—and so I&#8217;m happy to let them take the reins on stuff like that because obviously that&#8217;s not my specialty. I can do a lot of good things, but that&#8217;s not one of the things I try to do. </span></p>\n<p class=\"body_text\">But there&#8217;s been a lot of famous designers, believe it or not. Like, Tibor Kalman was another designer that was actually color blind. He actually founded Colors magazines and did lots of branding projects, and I&#8217;ve heard funny stories of him doing client presentations where he would just kind of be like, &#8220;And your green&#8230;&#8221; and then look to one of his assistants and they would just kind of point to the right one and he would move his finger. All these systems, they worked out before they could cheat with computers like I can. If you&#8217;re passionate about something you want to do then you find a way to work around it even if you have a little setback like that.</p>\n<p><b>Let&#8217;s talk about your mentors. You&#8217;ve worked for some really great people—how have they shaped you and your career?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, </span>sometimes I&#8217;ve had a mentor where they&#8217;re amazing and I&#8217;ve learned what to do, and sometimes they&#8217;ve been an example of what I don&#8217;t want to do, in pretty major ways. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think positives have definitely been all of them have encouraged me to teach, early in my career, and so I sought out a position with General Assembly last year in New York and started teaching their visual design class, which is perfect because I do it on Mondays and Wednesdays —it&#8217;s just two hours. I&#8217;ve done it a couple of times now where I know the curriculum pretty well. And it&#8217;s great for a lot of things. It&#8217;s humbling to go back to the beginnings of design and explain some of those things to people for the first time, and realize how much you&#8217;ve learned and how far you&#8217;ve come. So I really enjoy that and I think it&#8217;s also great to feel like you are helping people get excited about something you get excited about. Even just this week, because I&#8217;ve been rehearsing some basic principles with students, they were fresh in my mind and I was solving problems at work using some of the same basics. It&#8217;s easy to forget about them when you&#8217;re not rehearsing them on flash cards every day.  </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Sometimes I&#8217;ve had a mentor where they&#8217;re amazing and I&#8217;ve learned what to do, and sometimes they&#8217;ve been an example of what I don&#8217;t want to do, in pretty major ways.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think, I&#8217;ve also—people like Milton Glaser, Stefan Sagmeister, these kinds of icons of design, at least in the New York scene, less so here for some reason, I think because they&#8217;re graphic design. They&#8217;re great but they&#8217;re also kind of monoliths. They&#8217;re like examples that you can&#8217;t really follow because they&#8217;ve either had these insane success stories of how one design they made just blew up or they came from wealthy backgrounds where they can afford to just float on their family&#8217;s wealth while they launch their own studio for years and years and finally work their way up. Or they&#8217;re kind of dicks to everyone but that just worked for them because they had the right connections to make it happen. So there&#8217;s just been a lot of interesting examples. Milton&#8217;s a funny one because he&#8217;s 84 and still doing amazing work, still sharp as a tack. Working there was like working next to a philosopher where you could ask his lunch order and he would just say the most profound thing you&#8217;ve ever heard, right? But by the same token was totally dismissive of technology and kind of a cranky old man at times about where design was headed and a little bit cynical. And so, meeting your idols is always that dangerous, you know, the cliche of &#8220;never meet your idols&#8221;. It can be dangerous because they&#8217;ll inspire you in so many ways and in many ways be different from you. And sometimes that can challenge—maybe in a good way, maybe it challenges you in a good way because you hold onto the things that even that person, that amazing person that you always looked up to was unable to really change about you.</span></p>\n<p><b>What do you think your biggest motivators are? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I like fixing things, and I guess that&#8217;s like the most basic way to talk about it. Like, it&#8217;s a problem solving act when you design things, and so I&#8217;ve worked in a lot of strange, disparate industries—like Victoria&#8217;s Secret where you&#8217;re around supermodels to IBM where you&#8217;re not around supermodels and it&#8217;s like engineers in dad jeans on these weird antiquated campuses on these weird softwares, to like mobile advertising which is a terrible industry but has so many interesting psychological problems to try and play around with. And I think the connecting thread between all of them were that they all just had some kind of interesting problem to solve. Even Victoria&#8217;s Secret, which is a brand that can easily be mistaken as being about supermodels and lingerie and angel wings and stuff like that, actually had a very sophisticated e-commerce platform and they were solving really interesting problems around like how do they in real time adapt this system to show people the exact products they&#8217;re interested in, and just the coordination between all these different teams was actually really fascinating.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;But something that&#8217;s bothered me recently is I&#8217;ve realized that even though I&#8217;ve always enjoyed solving a problem, that high kind of fades after a certain amount of time, and then I get kind of bored with the problem. And I&#8217;ve realized that it needs to be something more than that, that there&#8217;s been a handful of times where I was actually really passionate about the topic and I was really interested in the problem. There&#8217;s only been a handful of times where those both existed for the same project, usually it&#8217;s just the problem I&#8217;m interested in solving.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>But something that&#8217;s bothered me recently is I&#8217;ve realized that even though I&#8217;ve always enjoyed solving a problem, that high kind of fades after a certain amount of time, and then I get kind of bored with the problem.

There&#8217;s only been a handful of times where those both existed for the same project, usually it&#8217;s just the problem I&#8217;m interested in solving.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> One time was my thesis project, which was an education platform that was trying to harness a lot of these game mechanics and find a really creative way to build a better online learning experience. I was really passionate about that topic in education and I was really excited about the problem I was solving. I tried to start that business out of school and realized that going 6 figures into debt of grad school loans and living in an expensive city like New York and not coming from a wealthy family to back my venture, was actually a really difficult time to try and start it. I still have that idea kind of logged away and maybe when my stock at some startup goes big, I can try and invest in that. But the only other time is now here at Airbnb where I feel like I&#8217;m really passionate about communities, I&#8217;m really passionate about people traveling and I feel like it&#8217;s a brand that&#8217;s really tried to open itself up to being a champion of those kinds of ideas, and so I think I&#8217;m excited now that I feel like I&#8217;ve finally perfected that balancing that passion about what a topic is and interest in the problem that&#8217;s solving too.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do your friends and family from home feel about how far you&#8217;ve come and the work that you&#8217;re doing? Are they like, &#8220;it&#8217;s a website. Do people work on that?&#8221;</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[laughter] Yeah, none of my family knew what Airbnb was, which blew my mind because I expected it from my parents a little bit, but even my siblings who are my age had actually never heard of it, which surprised me. Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting. I think I&#8217;m the only person in my family to have gone straight into college and I&#8217;m the only person to have a graduate degree at all. And I think compared to my parents, I&#8217;m far more career-oriented than they were. They got married when my mom was—they went to my mom&#8217;s senior prom and I think he proposed that night and they got married months afterwards or something like that. So they went headlong into—they&#8217;re from Ohio, so like in the Midwest, I think that was more a thing—and they went headlong into family building right off the bat and that was their focus. And they didn&#8217;t really finish school. My dad eventually went back and finished. So it&#8217;s just funny because </span>I feel a little bit like the black sheep in the family because their priority isn&#8217;t career things. They just don&#8217;t make as big of a deal about things that I tend to be really excited about when it comes to my career. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think my dad is a little bit more vocal about my career accomplishments. He’s definitely very proud. I think my mom&#8217;s side is very conservative and religious and I think they&#8217;re still [laughter] freaking out about the gay thing.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I feel a little bit like the black sheep in the family because their priority isn&#8217;t career things. They just don&#8217;t make as big of a deal about things that I tend to be really excited about when it comes to my career.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Outside of family, where do you find your support networks?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Close friends. I think I have a best friend that, he and I, we got randomly assigned as roommates in college. And were totally different people. We were just like opposites, really. Like, he was kind of this loud, crass hippy kind of guy. He was Buddhist at the time and exploring philosophy and I come from this very conservative family, so I was much more straight laced American Eagle wearing kind of guy. And then we totally brought each other to the middle ground, and both were very smart and challenged each other in conversations in college, and pushed each other .We have such a good friendship. It&#8217;s not a competitive thing, but it&#8217;s competitive enough that we push each other. And I have a couple of friends who are like that, and I feel like that&#8217;s where I find the most support &#8211; is having like-minded friends who just&#8211; not in an ego-driven way but just in like a genuinely ambitious passionate about certain ideas and pursue it. I think I&#8217;m naturally attracted to those kinds of people as friends and I think it just becomes a cycle where I seek them out and then they just push that certain behavior in me, and it just keeps going.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. Do you have any of those people here?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not yet. No, I do. I have one. I have a good friend Kelly who I met when I worked at IBM, who happened to move out here. And so I have one close friend like that here. Mostly I&#8217;m getting to a point where—and I still keep in close contact, so my best friend I still talk to every day, either via text or online throughout the day. So I keep close to those kinds of friends no matter what city I&#8217;m in. I think I&#8217;m also getting to a point where, just because I&#8217;ve kind of reached enough momentum that I know where I&#8217;m going, and I&#8217;ve found that Airbnb as a company in general has actually been a pretty good support network, more so than any place before. There&#8217;s the sitting down with me asking me about professional goals, asking about life goals that have nothing to do with the company, but are things like, &#8220;Do you want to write a book someday? Let&#8217;s talk about how we could make that happen.&#8221; That benefits them in some ways, but it&#8217;s clear that&#8217;s not the main reason they do that. But it does make me feel so much happier working there, knowing that there&#8217;s so many other positives that are going to happen here. So I feel like in many ways my job more than ever before has become more of a support network too.</span></p>\n<p class=\"body_text\"><b>That&#8217;s really cool actually. It’s a kind of counselling.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, and I feel like I&#8217;ve definitely had jobs where they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Where do you see yourself with the company? Let&#8217;s work on&#8230;&#8221; And that&#8217;s fine—</span></p>\n<p><b>As long as you work here.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, exactly. There&#8217;s a genuine visioning here about like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s talk about your career and what you want to be someday.&#8221; Which is really great to have those kinds of partners working around you, helping you find ways to get better, which you do. in a genuine way.</span></p>\n<p><b>What do you think about the state of tech in 2016? What is exciting to you, what is frustrating to you?</b></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m terrified it&#8217;s a bubble [laughter]. I talk about this a lot with my friends that, especially if you graduated into the recession, where after years of getting the best GPA you could, and all of the internships that you could have got, and the most practical major, and giving up all these cool other extracurriculars you thought you were interested in, you walked out into a job market that just had nothing for you. And I spent probably at least eight months without a job, which isn&#8217;t even as bad as other people, but was terrifying, and was, as someone who really always tried to be ambitious about the things they were doing with their lives, that was a really dark period. And so it haunts you.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m terrified it&#8217;s a bubble [laughter].

This might not be around forever.&#8221; <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which is such a negative terrible opinion so </span>I worry that tech has this little bit of naivete right now where it’s enjoying so much success that it&#8217;s not thinking—it&#8217;s not worried that this might not last forever, or how it might be doing things differently to think about scalability long term as an industry.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So, those are the things that I worry about.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;In Silicon Valley, where there&#8217;s such excess, you can&#8217;t help but even in the best of days, when you&#8217;re getting spoiled rotten with some kind of amazing outdoor activity, or some kind of perk, be thinking like, &#8220;Man, this is too good to be true.

Yeah, so there are days where you can marvel too that you&#8217;re getting to participate.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s also a time where there is still money flowing, there are still VCs funding great ideas, and I think it&#8217;s exciting to see—feel like you&#8217;re in the midst of something that&#8217;s on a scale like the industrial revolution, and you&#8217;re in the heart of it, and you&#8217;re meeting the people that are likely to be remembered as being great figures at this particular period.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also feel like I should talk about the shame. Coworkers of mine living in The Mission have told me they hide the company logos on their bags during their walks home. They&#8217;re proud of where they work and what they&#8217;re building, but they have to live a different life going home or going out in parts of San Francisco. I, personally, have had dates preach at me on how the tech scene is &#8216;ruining everything about San Francisco&#8217; while I silently pick at my food. Not long ago, there was a sign posted in The Mission that read, &#8220;If you work for any of the following companies: Google, Airbnb, Facebook, Uber, Twitter&#8230; [the list went on]. Then GET THE FUCK OUT OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a confusing sentiment to me.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I also feel like I should talk about the shame.

I&#8217;ve seen what happens when an industry “gets the fuck out.” It ain&#8217;t pretty. Communities disband. Generations of people suffer from unemployment, poor education, depression. Stigmas of failure soak into you. And eventually, bulldozers tearing down whole neighborhoods you remember. I understand the need to grow San Francisco responsibly and with respect to the character of neighborhoods. But this disdain for tech, instead of a desire to use it (and its taxes) for good, is baffling to me.</span></p>\n<p><b>What would you—within the context of designing to solve problems—like to see more of in this space, in terms of design?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hear a lot of people talk about how they don&#8217;t want to see people make more music apps or more food apps or something like that, and they want to see people like solve real problems. I don&#8217;t disagree with it, I just don&#8217;t find that I&#8217;ve encountered as many people as they have apparently who are building those kinds of apps.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think there&#8217;s a naivety of people saying, &#8220;I want to save the world with design.&#8221; I think I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people make posters and t-shirts and say that they&#8217;re saving the world with design.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>I think there&#8217;s a naivety of people saying, &#8220;I want to save the world with design.&#8221; I think I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people make posters and t-shirts and say that they&#8217;re saving the world with design. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Milton Glaser said something that always stuck with me. He said, &#8220;You have to be really smart to be a designer.&#8221; I feel like that doesn&#8217;t ever get evaluated, not in design schools and maybe not even enough in hiring processes for some jobs. </span>No one&#8217;s concerned about a designer&#8217;s intellectual interest or their intellectual stamina for hard problems and I feel like as an industry, it would be great that if design and designers were forced to have more of those deeper thoughts. You&#8217;ll do a portfolio review or you&#8217;ll do a quick problem-solving session where you try and design for someone in an interview, but rarely are you asked a deep question or a hard problem or even a logic problem. I&#8217;m just throwing out examples because maybe those are all silly ways to evaluate true intelligence, but some equivalent that really just gets to the heart of, &#8220;Is this person good at thinking deeply about the problem they’re solving?&#8221;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It&#8217;s not just designers that have that problem, but designers when they can combine solid thinking with all of the other amazing skill sets they have they really form a power more than others expect of them. So I wish we were doing a little more thinking I guess.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. I feel you. On that note, what would you like to see taught more to young designers that you see in the industry? It might be the same answer.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A little bit. It&#8217;s hard to teach thinking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are great questions. I feel like my mentors would have really profound insights. I think I&#8217;m still kind of grasping at straws to try to solve them.</span></p>\n<p class=\"body_text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I teach all the time to designers, and I try to find ways to make them care about what past designers have said. I feel like, especially places where I teach, like General Assembly, which is a very career focused, very tangible like, &#8221;How does this relate to my job?&#8221; kind of questions you get from students. </span>I worry sometimes that we&#8217;re losing like the academic side of things or we&#8217;re losing something like spiritual side of design education. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like the Eames have these amazing design perspectives. I&#8217;ve been relying on them pretty heavy actually in the last few classes more so than other design figures. Because they were so great at talking about other things that I think designers should be paying more attention to. About innovating on your designs, about having this attitude of serious play, an interest in how design plays a role in education, etc. Because so much of what we do in terms of communication are also education. </span>I wish there was more attention paid to our old heroes and a greater appreciation amongst digital designers for some of those legacies because there&#8217;s still so many lessons to learn from them. It&#8217;s not just about what the latest shortcut in Sketch is or how to work best in agile development flows. There should be an appreciation for our longer history and the way that that context is still very relevant, how all those patterns still repeat even in the kinds of mediums we work today.</p>\n<p><b>Yeah. This is a very nourishing conversation for me.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have problems going to even—I&#8217;ve stopped actually, I&#8217;ve stopped going altogether to design talks. There&#8217;s so many of them, and I feel weird about it because even though Airbnb and lots of companies offer a design education budget where you can go pick a talk that you want to go listen to or a conference. I&#8217;m just fatigued with them. I don&#8217;t like the forced awkward social interactions of going to this place, like, &#8220;You have the same job as me. We must have reasons to talk,&#8221; or I don&#8217;t know. Hearing people talk about a topic and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You don&#8217;t know any more about this than I do. We are all still figuring this out.” And I feel like the best things I&#8217;ve ever heard are things like UX book clubs, where you go deep dive on a topic. There are more branching connections. Maybe I really am a generalist. And then there&#8217;s a discussion about it where you&#8217;re learning from other people, but there&#8217;s a core topic to focus on. Whenever it&#8217;s these open-ended talks, I&#8217;m just either bored or just starting to get frustrated with them. But I think maybe that&#8217;s part of it. Again, it&#8217;s still so specialized. It&#8217;s a very specific aspect of design. And I would much rather someone start with, &#8220;How&#8217;s a banana like Napoleonic battle plan?&#8221; And then have some really interesting connection between those seemingly disparate things.</span></p>\n<p><b>So, how is a banana like a Napoleonic battle plan? Jk. What are you working on right now, either for work or for yourself? What&#8217;s 2016 goals?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I actually have a lot more travel goals. Like life experience goals. The west coast is all new to me. So this weekend&#8217;s my first trip to Seattle, and I&#8217;m going to do a road trip with my friend. And I&#8217;ve never been in LA, and I went to Las Vegas once but I was sick the whole time, so I didn’t really go. And I want to see Portland. There&#8217;s a lot of travel that I&#8217;m going to do over here that&#8217;s kind of preoccupying me, but—</span></p>\n<p><b>You’re going to love exploring the west coast.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s so much more scenic than the east coast. Like, I love the east coast but it&#8217;s also like home to me. I&#8217;ve seen it a thousand times with driving up and down it all the time, so this is all brand new and it&#8217;s really exciting.</span></p>\n<p><b>The first time I ever drove up and down Highway One, I was just like, &#8220;Now that I know it exists I can&#8217;t not live here.&#8221; And I moved here like two months later. And California still feels a little out of grasp as far as permanence, but it&#8217;s very much like now that I know it&#8217;s here I can&#8217;t not be in it.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. I can totally see that happening to me. I just did like a little taste of it up in Marin County with The Redwoods and stuff like that and was blown away. Just totally way bigger, better than I thought it was even in pictures. So, yeah, I&#8217;m sure as I continue to explore I&#8217;m going to find myself conflicted. I don’t think I&#8217;ll go back to the east coast as easily as I always thought I would some day.</span></p>\n<p><b>Well, that was my next question. Where do you see yourself in five or ten years? Do you think you&#8217;re going to go back?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was the question that made me move here, actually. So I was talking with a friend. She does a podcast, actually, on LGBT people in tech.</span></p>\n<p><b>Cool.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I should point you to it.</span></p>\n<p><b>I would like to meet her.</b></p>\n<p class=\"body_text\">She&#8217;s great. So she was doing this interview series—we went to graduate school together, so she was kind of doing friends first, and so she did me as her first test subject through this—and she asked that question, and at the time she asked it I was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s kind of a cliche question.&#8221; And then I thought more about it, and I told her, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I guess in five years I see myself hopefully—I can really answer more specifically—it&#8217;s hard to answer about what I&#8217;ll be working on.&#8221; Because at the time when I was asked this over the summer I was working on mobile ads, which is—I think that did not exist five years ago. And now I work for Airbnb on aspects of the sharing economy that didn&#8217;t exist five years ago. When you work in this industry you just know that,&#8221;I have no idea what I&#8217;m going to be working on in five years. Maybe it&#8217;ll be self-driving cars or something.&#8221; But I did have some ideas about where I saw myself going personally, and it was about finally meeting someone and settling down and all that sort of thing. And after I had that talk with her, I realized, &#8220;Shit, if I&#8217;m going to settle down in the next five years, then the next five years are kind of—not my last time to do anything single, but I should certainly think a little bit about what would be really hard to do after I settle down, and probably moving across the country is one of them.&#8221; And so I Iooked back at the shortlist of cities I wanted to live in, and I was like, &#8220;I should probably—&#8221; I really love New York and I&#8217;m really comfortable here and I actually didn&#8217;t see myself leaving any sometime soon, but maybe I should hold off on settling down because I should still stay open to it. Not but two weeks later, Airbnb&#8217;s recruiter called me up and was like, &#8220;Hey, are you interested in a job?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not.&#8221; But I feel like after that conversation I should keep doors open if something on the West Coast is calling. Sure enough, everything unfolded and six weeks later after that conversation with my friend, I was packing up and moving across the country.</p>\n<p><b>Wow.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s a scary question to me now because [chuckles] my whole life turns on a dime when I try to answer that one. But yeah, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s changed much since the summer. My answer is more or less the same but now I&#8217;m over here. I think it&#8217;s been good keeping my mind open of if I would like to settle down a little bit in five years then I really need to keep prodding myself to not get lazy in terms of keep my mental plasticity fresh, and keep trying to solve new problems, and keep trying to stay open to new cultures, and embrace the West Coast and it&#8217;s hippie weird shit, and learn about it and get to know people who are into it. Because if I rest too easy and just surround myself with the same New Yorkers, I feel like I&#8217;m missing the point of these next few years where it&#8217;s easier to do all these open things as a single person.</span></p>\n<p><b>I will say after almost seven years here, I feel right in the middle. I&#8217;m definitely East Coast in a lot of ways. I definitely have the New York hard ass-ness to me. I&#8217;m part redneck, so there are things about the south that I definitely appreciate. But I feel like I&#8217;m half west coast now, and it&#8217;s really—like you can either view that as you don&#8217;t fit in anywhere or it&#8217;s just kind of lovely to just kind of know what the best parts are and just soak them in. It’s fun being a hybrid that works her ass off but also sleeps a lot, and is easygoing but also super alpha. It&#8217;s fun to kind of glean the positives from all of the places that you&#8217;ve lived and just end up being a mutt.</b></p>\n<p class=\"body_text\">Maybe you feel the same way I do, but when people ask where I&#8217;m from I find I change my answer depending on where I know they&#8217;re from. So if someone&#8217;s from like Indiana then I&#8217;ll say I&#8217;m from Ohio, which is really where I was born.</p>\n<p class=\"body_text\"><b>I was born in Indiana.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But if someone&#8217;s from the south then I&#8217;m more likely to say, &#8220;Oh, yeah, well, I went to high school in Florida,&#8221; which I did spend roughly half my life in Florida so it&#8217;s technically true. But other times ask, from San Francisco, &#8220;Where are you from&#8221;, and I say, &#8220;Oh, I just moved here from New York.&#8221; Being from all these different places, I find that I kind of like do this chameleon thing where I play to my strengths, basically, of all the best possible places I&#8217;ve lived.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. That makes sense to me completely. This is such an extreme example, but I had to photograph George W. this year, and in my mind I was like, &#8220;If he knows I&#8217;m from San Francisco this is going to go horribly.&#8221; So he was like, &#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; and I was like, &#8220;North Carolina,&#8221; with my old southern accent.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There you go. I would totally do that. I would be totally like, &#8220;Oh, I lived in Austin for a while. I loved Texas.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, like, &#8220;How can I be as Southern as possible so that you will cooperate with me?&#8221;</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[laughter]</span></p>\n<p><b>Let&#8217;s see. I actually think I already asked you this, but let’s just dig in again. What advice would you have for folks just getting started in the industry? What do you wish you had known in the beginning?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I walked into it with a lot of—</span>I actually had some really negative influences when I first started designing, I remember. People who made me feel really inferior because I didn&#8217;t know about design, and I didn&#8217;t have a formal background in design so I didn&#8217;t know all these design heroes, who I later got to meet and work with—talk about a rags to riches kind of thing—but a lot of people made me feel bad about that.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A lot of people were very pretentious in the design world. I knew the tools; I knew how to use Photoshop, I knew how to do some of the stuff, I had an intuition about how to make some things, but I didn&#8217;t know a lot of the principles. So there was a lot I had to learn. I know a lot people who, unfortunately, didn&#8217;t encourage me, but just made me feel like there&#8217;s just too much for you to learn for you to try and get into this on your own.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I actually had some really negative influences when I first started designing, I remember.

In fact, </span>I think there is an innocence before you actually learn all your principles about design, that is something you should just kind of enjoy while you have it. There&#8217;s just kind of a freedom of playing<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I don&#8217;t know, maybe that&#8217;s not true. Maybe the principles actually free you to experiment better. But, sometimes I worry I play it too safe now that I know more of the rules, quote unquote. There&#8217;s just that nice moment where you&#8217;re starting to get interested in design that people should really hold onto and embrace.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think there is an innocence before you actually learn all your principles about design, that is something you should just kind of enjoy while you have it.

I think people should know that, too. I&#8217;ve been doing design for about ten years now, and I think some people don’t realize how long it takes to get where you want to be. My step-brother, for example, did acting in college. And now he&#8217;s kind of reached this point—where I feel a lot of actors do—where he&#8217;s been doing it, trying to do it for a few years. And he&#8217;s kind of like, &#8220;Alright, this isn&#8217;t going to happen. I need to look at something else.&#8221; So, he&#8217;s looked at design a few times. Some of his friends have looked at design. But I think there&#8217;s this kind of assumption like, &#8220;Oh yeah, I&#8217;ll learn Photoshop. You&#8217;ll give me some tips, and then I&#8217;ll be like working at Conde Nast next year,&#8221; or something like that. I have to remind him that it took like five—no, how long ago was that? </span>Maybe six or seven years ago, I couldn&#8217;t even get a Tampa ad agency to hire me as an entry-level designer. It took a long time of building up a career—of some dumb luck, of building up a portfolio—before I finally got into bigger positions that really started to let me influence bigger and bigger projects, and have a lot of fun with it, in the way that I like to have fun with it.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So, I would encourage people who are getting started to </span>be patient, to understand that just because you can easily access a copy of Sketch or Photoshop doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;re going to be an overnight success. If there&#8217;s ever anyone in your life who&#8217;s telling you that you shouldn&#8217;t bother doing that, that you should just keep pushing through it. Because hopefully there&#8217;s&#8211; eventually some better influences around you who will help out.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And if you don&#8217;t have any of them, then you should go to General Assembly and I will help you [laughter].</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Maybe six or seven years ago, I couldn&#8217;t even get a Tampa ad agency to hire me as an entry-level designer.

It wasn’t the safest or nicest neighborhood, but for my parents it was a step up from the situation back home on the Cape Verde Islands.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I love it when people tell me I can&#8217;t do something and then proving them wrong. I get a kick out of that.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> After the birth of my youngest brother, my mother made two key decisions that would significantly impact our lives and futures. First, she decided to move her family from a troubled neighborhood in Boston to a much safer community. And second; she sent us to a private Catholic school in said community. These events limited our exposure to drugs and gang violence, and got us access to quality education.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My high school was funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to supports its innovative model where students would attend regular classes for four days. The fifth day was reserved for a full time job shared amongst five students. We learned valuable, real life skills and could put away the earnings towards our tuition. This is where I was exposed to technology for the first time. I worked with engineers and was quickly captivated by all its potential.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;One of my biggest insecurities is language. English is not my first language, and because of that, I don&#8217;t feel like I have the vocabulary to be as persuasive as I&#8217;d like to be. Immigrant parents combined with marginalized, low-quality education doesn’t really build a ton self-confidence. &#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the proximity of universities like Harvard, MIT, and Tufts to my home, I never really thought about college until my cousin invited me to spend a weekend with her at Boston College. That experience was transformative for me because suddenly college felt like an obtainable goal. If my cousin could make it, so could I.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My college experience was, like it is for many people who look like me, very challenging. I had to balance lectures and exams with jobs, but that’s how I ended up working for Karmaloop. And at Karmaloop I got exposed to design, art, streetwear brands, marketing – brands like Supreme and Married to the Mob – all of which had strong foundations in graphic design. After I got my degree in neuroscience, I decided to do something for myself. I bought a one way ticket to San Francisco and left everything behind. In San Francisco I found design, technology, art, and myself.  For the first three years I worked as a user research lead for a startup that allowed me to travel all over the world. I got exposed to the long hours and high pressure of tech, but was able to tap deeply into my passion for design.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I worked in tech as interaction designer for a few years now. Those years gave me enough insights into the treatment of women. But one of my biggest issues with the whole diversity conversation is that is it’s often too much conversation. As a designer, I wanted to build and test something that could actually be shipped.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I fondly remember Ben Horowitz telling me, &#8216;There&#8217;s offense, and there’s defense. And what you&#8217;re telling me right now is that you&#8217;re taking people of color, who are naturally creative. People of color invented hip-hop, jazz, blues, and rock ‘n’ roll, and you&#8217;re putting them in an arena where they&#8217;re positioned to win. I think it&#8217;s a great idea. Let&#8217;s go tell Kanye about it.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I quit my job in early 2015 and founded Front &amp; Center. I wanted to expose creative young adults from underrepresented communities to non-engineering roles in tech. I researched and worked with design leaders from Facebook, Google, KPCB, Vice and many others to define a basic set of required skills for product designers that don’t pursue a traditional academic path. That research resulted in a design training program consisting of basic design, communication and presentation skills. Today, I mostly mentor through Front &amp; Center, consult as a designer. </span></p>\n<p><b>  What has your experience been building Front &amp; Center?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m very lucky because my partner has been an entrepreneur for years; he helped me out by coaching me on how to avoid typical first time founder mistakes. But even with his help, there is a lot of falling on my face. I saw a problem, but had no solution. So I started building what I thought was right, but while speaking with investors I figured out it’s very hard to find a model for something that usually fits within the non-profit mold. So I had to do a lot of catching up on how to run an actual business, so I wouldn&#8217;t look like a fool. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And one of my biggest insecurities is language. English is not my first language, and because of that, I don&#8217;t feel like I have the vocabulary to be as persuasive as I&#8217;d like to be.

Well–it’s super hard for me to fake anything because I have no reference points. Getting help from someone that’s gone through similar hurdles is practically impossible because there are very few people who look like me that do what I do.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding people you can look up to and model your progress after is so important to individual development. Even today I struggle to find role models. There are very few successful black women who made it as designers.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve been able to expand my network with some amazing people. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I fondly remember Ben Horowitz telling me, &#8220;There&#8217;s offense, and there’s defense.

Let&#8217;s go tell Kanye about it.&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Now these kinds of things happen in Silicon Valley, but all I could think of was “Oh my god, I get to meet Kanye West.” Moments like these don’t come often when you’re a founder. They definitely don’t come when you’re a founder from a marginalized community. But moments like these keep you going, wherever you’re from as a founder.</span></p>\n<p><b>Tell me more about just the struggles you&#8217;ve overall had in your time of tech. What are the roadblocks you&#8217;ve had to overcome?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know when they say, “just fake it till you make it”, right? Well – it’s super hard for me to fake anything because I have no reference points. Getting help from someone that’s gone through similar hurdles is practically impossible because there are very few people who look like me that do what I do.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding people you can look up to and model your progress after is so important to individual development. Even today I struggle to find role models. There are very few successful black women who made it as designers.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So you have to look beyond your appearance, One person that has inspired my way of thinking about the world is Elle Luna. She’s a person that lives her truth, and I’m thankful to have learned that it’s enough to be inspired. Having role models that look like you is great. But when there aren’t any out there, you need to learn to look up to individuals that don’t necessarily look like you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can’t stress enough how important role models are. And I want to be that role model for the community that I’m from.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When I hear celebrities say, “I’m not a role model, I’m an artist, I can do whatever I want”, I say no: You’re one of the few that made it out. You can show others how to do that. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Passing on information is so important to break the cycles of division and separation. I’m in a unique position to set the example for future generations.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve been thinking a lot about tech-debt in communities of color lately. Access to technology in communities like the one I’m from is incomparable to the access to technology that most people who become successful in Silicon Valley have. Most Black schools have pretty abysmal computer science labs. Students don’t have computers at home, let alone an internet connection. So next to figuring out what stock options mean, a lot of people who are trying to break into technology need to catch up on people who’ve been exposed to tech for much, much longer.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I had the privilege to get my first personal computer when I was 14 years old. And I didn&#8217;t really know what code was until I was 19. But most of my peers in tech have had access to technology for all their lives, and role models that encouraged them to explore. For people who come from communities like mine, a career in tech is like a pipe dream. There is nobody around you who’s made it in tech, and no parents of family members who can tell you about the career opportunities. Sure, leadership skills come somewhat naturally, but communication can be a challenge when you haven’t been exposed to tech culture like so many of the people around me have.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’ve been thinking a lot about tech-debt in communities of color lately.

Both as a product designer and as an entrepreneur.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having an academic background has mostly triggered a thirst to keep learning. I like watching things and studying their patterns, which is another side to this inclusion discussion that I find remarkable. When people stop learning and stop questioning the way the world works around them, things like bias, discrimination and racism come into play. I’ve been trying to fix that conversation by prototyping solutions that can actually be implemented, and found that in order to work in tech – an academic path is very beneficial but in most cases, not an absolute necessity. Especially in the field of design. </span></p>\n<p><b>What would you say are your big motivators?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love it when people tell me I can&#8217;t do something and then proving them wrong. I get a kick out of that.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I decided to speak out more because I want kids to know how to deal with similar situations. I want them to say, &#8220;I want to be like Melanie when I grow up.&#8221; I didn’t have anyone I could be like growing up. So I collected all this advice; some of it I can use, some of it I can’t. Bits and pieces of people that have inspired me along the way, and I try to keep improving myself like that.</span></p>\n<p><b>Okay, let&#8217;s just go macro real quick. How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? What excites you, what frustrates you, and what would you like to see change?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m most excited about  companies that exist to do good and challenge the way we think about the world, so I&#8217;m really in love with Honor. I love what they&#8217;re doing, I love the problem that they&#8217;re solving. It&#8217;s really exciting because it&#8217;s a human problem and everyone benefits from it. The workforce, the families, even the way they run the company. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The things that frustrate me? There are still too many non-problems being solved. Things that are only accessible by a very controlled, homogenous audience. I’m worried about the accessibility of technology. Many processes continue to optimize and drive down prices, making things more affordable – but there very few processes that focus on making life more enjoyable.</span></p>\n<p><b>What advice would you have for folks coming from similar backgrounds as yours who are hoping to get into tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need that hustle. A strong will to succeed because you will hear “no” more often than people will tell you “yes.” Shit will get hard. But if it’d be easy, anybody would be doing it. We experience racism and other difficulties every single day. Use that sadness and anger to lift yourself up in the right direction. If people don’t believe you, build whatever you can and try to prove them wrong.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> With Front &amp; Center I’ve tried to hack a system that I found didn’t make sense. So I decided to make a change. I measure my success by the opportunities I create for other people. I want people to join me in designing a more inclusive future. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You need that hustle. A strong will to succeed because you will hear “no” more often than people will tell you &#8216;yes.&#8217; Shit will get hard. But if it’d be easy, anybody would be doing it.

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><strong>Let&#8217;s start from the beginning. Tell me about your early years and where you come from.</strong></p>\n<p>I was born in Thailand in 1980 in a refugee camp near the border of Thailand and Cambodia. It was the aftermath of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Fields\" target=\"_blank\">Killing Fields</a> where a million Cambodians died during the Khmer Rouge’s communist regime. My parents never talked much about that time, since it was so traumatic for them. And I don’t remember anything because I was so young. I do know that both of my parents lost their first spouses during that time.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was the poorest person in class, and one of the only Cambodians. At the time, I didn’t realize everyone else was actually pretty poor. But there was still a hierarchy even amongst the poorest of the poor. Like it was hard getting teased for wearing the wrong type of shoes or the same shirt several days in a row.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>My mom did tell me about how I had gotten pneumonia as a baby and almost died. She still has the X-rays. It was very, very hard for her, but she loves telling me that the early sickness boosted my immune system because I rarely got sick after that as a child. Too bad it didn’t last into my 30s. I get colds all the time now.</p>\n<p>In 1984, we immigrated to the US as refugees as war. Our airfare was sponsored by a Mormon family, whom I don&#8217;t remember ever meeting, but it’s why we converted to Mormonism. We landed in Oakland and I&#8217;ve been in the Bay Area ever since.</p>\n<p><strong>You may not have super early memories but I&#8217;m curious to know what it was like arriving at the States for your family and what adjusting to life in Oakland was like?</strong></p>\n<p>My earliest memory is us living in cramped apartments around the Lake Merritt area with my grandmother and cousins. I went to a year-round school called Franklin Elementary, which was predominantly Asian. After the first grade, we moved to West Oakland, and I attended Hoover Elementary which was mostly African-American.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It  felt completely normal to live together with eight or nine people in a tiny one bedroom apartment. It was really communal, and we survived on very little—24k a year of government assistance, which my mom miraculously made work somehow.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>In both settings, I felt like an outsider. I was the poorest person in class, and one of the only Cambodians. At the time, I didn’t realize everyone else was actually pretty poor. But there was still a hierarchy even amongst the poorest of the poor. Like it was hard getting teased for wearing the wrong type of shoes or the same shirt several days in a row.</p>\n<p>My parents also didn’t speak English, so it was a constant struggle to switch between different cultures between home and school.</p>\n<p><strong>What did your family expect of you? What kind of pressure did they put on you to excel or be something when you grew up or that sort of thing?</strong></p>\n<p>My mom was particularly emphatic about education, and doing well in school. That was the top-most priority. She would always say, &#8220;You don&#8217;t need friends. They&#8217;ll just bring you down. Just focus on school.&#8221; I just assumed it was an Asian mom thing. But later, I learned she had an uncle who paid for her to attend school back in Cambodia. That experience must have made her acutely value education, because it’s not free in many countries.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Food is interesting. People I meet love to say, “wow, you must have had delicious food growing up”, as if every meal was a dish from their favorite Thai restaurant. It’s always weird to be exoticized.

He learned to be a barber in the refugee camps and was very meticulous about it. He cut my hair growing up until his hands failed him. He was also very particular with the shoes and clothes he bought for me, even when they came from The Goodwill. I have a fond memory of him saving up money so that he could get pants made by a tailor in Chinatown. It was really fun to see him pick fabrics. I definitely got my eye for design from him.</p>\n<p><strong>What aspects of growing up to you obviously felt normal at the time? Now that you&#8217;re in Silicon Valley you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Man. My upbringing was different than a lot of people&#8217;s here.&#8221;? What memories stick out to you?</strong></p>\n<p>I have a lot of siblings, six younger than me and one older half-sister. It  felt completely normal to live together with eight or nine people in a tiny one bedroom apartment. It was really communal, and we survived on very little—24k a year of government assistance, which my mom miraculously made work somehow.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, I hear complaints about how small the apartments are in SF and how making 175k/year isn’t enough. I totally get that in this market, but everything is much more luxurious than what I grew up with.</p>\n<p>Food is interesting. People I meet love to say, “wow, you must have had delicious food growing up”, as if every meal was a dish from their favorite Thai restaurant. It’s always weird to be exoticized. What was normal for us was actually an extremely basic diet of rice with a small side of protein. McDonald&#8217;s and Chinese take-out was like the “fancy” treat for special occasions.</p>\n<p>I remember one of my first “American” meals. A woman from our church invited me to her brother’s family for dinner. Everything was so plentiful, and I remember this giant salad bowl, and I immediately asked. &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s no rice?&#8221; That became a running joke every time I ate dinner there. I also remembering getting to high school and eating a bagel for the first time. I was like, &#8220;Whoa, delicious!”</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s amazing to think back, because I&#8217;m such a foodie now and really enjoy the spectrum of food available in San Francisco. I hate bagels now, though.</p>\n<p><strong>Oh man. What were school years like for you? Did you have any technical inclinations or creative inclinations? When was that first developing for you?</strong></p>\n<p>In first grade, we had a computer lab, which I took to very naturally. Creatively, I was obsessed with origami and could make very intricate pieces. My mom thought it was an incredible waste of paper, so I would rip out endsheets in books and use that for folding.</p>\n<p>In middle school, I took both art and computer classes. What was really cool, was that my art teacher was married to my computer teacher. Later when my art teacher, Ms. James, found out that I&#8217;d become a designer, she was thrilled.</p>\n<p><strong>Walk me through those later years of school and then eventually getting into college.</strong></p>\n<p>High school was awesome. Many people talk about their high school years as the most horrible time in their lives, and I actually had a really wonderful time. I went to Oakland Technical High School—which I had to work really hard to enroll in, because it wasn’t my assigned school.</p>\n<p>I had a great education because I was equally exposed to the sciences, liberal arts, and creative arts. I was in a Magnet program called the Health &amp; Biosciences Academy, as well as a humanities program called Paideia, which was taught using the Socratic method. Both of those programs really taught me to think critically and very deeply about the world.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I started studying for the SAT&#8217;s when I was in the seventh grade because I was just like, &#8216;If I don&#8217;t go to college, then I’m never leaving the ghetto.&#8217; I had this great fear of being in a cycle of poverty that I saw my peers get trapped in.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>At the same time, I was also really involved in the journalism program. I was co-Editor-in-Chief of the school newspaper, which is where a lot of my inspiration to become a designer came from. We were designing the newspaper by hand, actually cutting out printed columns and doing paste-ups for the printers. I also worked on our high school’s first video yearbook, which introduced me to Adobe products for the first time.</p>\n<p><strong>Was college something you thought that was possible for you financially? Or like as a kid, did you think it was basically possible?</strong></p>\n<p>I always believed it was possible. I had both incredible faith and anxiety around it. I started studying for the SAT&#8217;s when I was in the seventh grade because I was just like, “If I don&#8217;t go to college, then I’m never leaving the ghetto.” I had this great fear of being in a cycle of poverty that I saw my peers get trapped in.</p>\n<p>I didn’t worry too much about the financial aspect of it, because I was pretty aware of loans, scholarships, and grants. If I had worried too much about the finances, I think I would have been paralyzed to act.</p>\n<p>In the last couple of years of high school, my grades ended up being really shitty, so I didn’t apply to the Ivies or UC’s like most of my Paideia classmates. I had been too focused on everything else that interested me non-academically: helping to run the school newspaper, starting a gay-straight alliance, leading our high school’s Sierra Club program, learning radio journalism at Youth Radio, and performing in plays and dances. And, at the same time, I was trying to come to terms with being both gay and Mormon. It was a lot, and my grades got pretty shot. In the end, I knew I wanted to do design and applied to just one school, the California College of Arts and Crafts. It’s now just called California College of the Arts. I was relieved when I was accepted, and I remember telling my best friend, Ben, “My future&#8217;s going to be okay now.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>At that point, did you have any idea that you&#8217;d end up working in Silicon Valley. Was that on your radar?</strong></p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think so actually. The dotcom boom was still nascent when I entered college, and I was very interested in motion graphics because of the work I did on my high school’s video yearbook. Of course, the dotcom boom reached its peak quickly after I started school. CCA was mostly print-based, but a professor named David Karam started a program called New Media, which I quickly enrolled in. It was a mix of motion graphics, information design, programming, and interaction design. I fell in love with the classes and knew I wanted to work on very technical, internet-related projects.</p>\n<p><strong>What was going to art school like after coming from a big high school in Oakland?</strong></p>\n<p>I’d been exposed to so many different cultures and types of people early on in life—Asians around Lake Merritt, African Americans in West Oakland, and wealthy white Mormons in the Oakland hills and beyond—that adapting to art school was relatively fluid. You just learned to weave in and out of different groups.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I felt a lot of otherness. I met so many kids that came from an enormous amount of wealth and privilege, who weren’t serious at all. They didn’t know what they wanted to do and had parents who funded their experiment with art school. The majority of students truly wanted to be artists or designers and they were very serious about it, but others were just there to play.</p>\n<p><strong>Walk me through your tech career. What happened from there?</strong></p>\n<p>In college, I got a really awesome internship at a company called Move Design. It was started by two former IDEO designers, Peter Spreenberg and Samuel Lising. My friends, Dain and Kim, were also working there, so we just did a range of fun, interactive projects. I learned ActionScript, Lingo, JavaScript, PHP, and Perl during that time. That’s what really got me super excited about the internet, programming, and interaction design.</p>\n<p>When the boom went bust, I went to work for Youth Radio in Berkeley as a teacher and designer.</p>\n<p>After that, I was hired as an intern by Conor Mangat at <a href=\"http://sanfrancisco.metadesign.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MetaDesign</a>, which is one of the top branding agencies in the world. The San Francisco office had been started by a favorite professor of mine, Terry Irwin, along with Erik Spiekermann and Bill Hill. I was lucky to get that job because it was the nadir of the dotcom bust. The San Francisco office had just downsized from over 100 people to less than 10, so I’m very grateful to Conor for believing in me early on.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I joined the Gmail team. When I started, there was only one other full-time designer on Gmail. The way we ended up splitting it, was that my colleague, Jason Cornwell, worked on desktop, and I worked on mobile. It was just really cool to have that much responsibility and impact. Mobile Gmail was supposed to be my 20% project, but that quickly became my 120% project.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>My work at MetaDesign was mostly visual design for brands and websites, but eventually, I wanted to branch out into UX. I was really inspired by Hugh Dubberly, a former design manager at Apple who’s ridiculously smart and knowledgeable about design history and theory. He eventually became my mentor and hired me at his studio, <a href=\"http://www.dubberly.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dubberly Design Office</a>. I was super happy working there and stayed for 5 years.</p>\n<p>One day a sourcer from Google emailed me out of the blue. I remembered when I was at MetaDesign, a recruiter from Apple had contacted me. I blew it off and later regretted it. So this time around, I decided to follow up on the email, even though I was very happy at Dubberly.</p>\n<p>I had a few phone conversations with Google, then went down for a day of interviews. I was so impressed with everyone I talked to, and the opportunity for learning was so huge, that I decided join. It was an amazing experience, though when I first joined, I felt like I didn&#8217;t really belong there.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It’s a big psychological shift to be a founder. Our employees depend on us to feed their families and themselves. They depend on us for helping them grow professionally and personally. I take it much more seriously because of that responsibility. It’s not a hobby. It’s a real business where the success or failure of the company has huge impacts on everyone.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Expand on that.</strong></p>\n<p>I just felt like everyone was so much smarter or so much more accomplished. During orientation, they were like, &#8220;Oh, here&#8217;s some amazing people that work here.&#8221; They profile all these ridiculously-accomplished people. I’m like, &#8220;Uhh. What? Why am I even here?&#8221; Eventually you get over that a little bit, partly because you talk to other people who say, &#8220;Oh yeah, I felt the same way.&#8221; Later on, I read about impostor syndrome which describes this phenomenon.</p>\n<p><strong>What did you work on while at Google?</strong></p>\n<p>I joined the Gmail team. When I started, there was only one other full-time designer on Gmail. The way we ended up splitting it, was that my colleague, Jason Cornwell, worked on desktop, and I worked on mobile. It was just really cool to have that much responsibility and impact. Mobile Gmail was supposed to be my 20% project, but that quickly became my 120% project. Now the Gmail team is huge and it&#8217;s really awesome.</p>\n<p><strong>So crazy. What has it been like transitioning from a tech employee to tech-founder?</strong></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s definitely very different. There&#8217;s a lot more responsibility because of who is dependent on you. At Google, I was an individual contributor, and even though I had a lot of impact, no one was dependent on me for their own livelihood. It’s a big psychological shift to be a founder. Our employees depend on us to feed their families and themselves. They depend on us for helping them grow professionally and personally. I take it much more seriously because of that responsibility. It’s not a hobby. It’s a real business where the success or failure of the company has huge impacts on everyone.</p>\n<p><strong>What are some of the struggles and roadblocks that you&#8217;ve had to overcome both as employee and entrepreneur?</strong></p>\n<p>My biggest struggle is social anxiety, which progressively got worse as I got older. There were times when I would have panic attacks in public streets or just walking into a room. It was a huge barrier to becoming a leader. That probably held me back a little bit, actually probably a lot, at Google. I overcame it when I stumbled on a research program at Stanford that was comparing methodologies for treating social anxiety. I was accepted into the study, and went through 12 weeks of treatment and cognitive behavioral therapy. It worked, and it’s much less of a problem now, even though it’s always there.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;My biggest struggle is social anxiety, which progressively got worse as I got older.

It was a huge barrier to becoming a leader.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Awhile back, I read about how Nightmare on Elm Street was inspired by Cambodian trauma survivors who died in their sleep from nightmares. And I later read about how trauma, especially amongst survivors of genocide like Cambodians, can be passed down biologically to their children. It really helped explain why depression, stress, and anxiety is so prominent in my family, so it’s something I continuously watch out for in myself and my family.</p>\n<p><strong>What has working in tech been like knowing that you don&#8217;t have any financial network or safety net?</strong></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard and it’s fragile. I talk to a lot of other entrepreneurs who have families they can fall back on if they fail. And if their families aren’t wealthy by income, they own property and have accumulated value, so they still have another plan B. Many other entrepreneurs also have fewer financial obligations, meaning they don’t have to support their siblings, parents, or extended family. I get that everyone struggles. But clearly, some struggle more than others. A lot of people take for granted the network and privilege they have, and they don’t realize how incredibly lucky they are. For me, it&#8217;s always precarious. I’m on a founder’s salary, which is less than half of what I was making at Google, and I still need to support family members as well as myself. It’s very tough when you don’t have much of a plan B, but it makes me more driven to make the business succeed.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I talk to a lot of other entrepreneurs who have families they can fall back on if they fail.

Do you ever feel isolation in the industry? For me personally, when I worked in tech, I felt a sense of otherness and isolation a lot. Not from being a white chick, there are plenty of white chicks—but socioeconomically. I came from a small town, went to public state school, moved here with no money, also did not have a financial support network. I just never met anyone that I could really relate to. I&#8217;m curious if you ended up feeling those senses of isolation during your career? Just based on being different?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes absolutely.</p>\n<p>At Google, I remember sitting at work and overhearing a conversation where someone said, &#8220;Oh yeah, I have a couple of houses and my partner has a house too, but it&#8217;s just too hard to manage.&#8221; She was literally complaining about having multiple houses, and I was just like, &#8220;Wow, what world is this?&#8221; It was definitely not a world I came from.</p>\n<p>When you come from poverty and you’re also gay, Cambodian, Mormon, and a refugee of war, there’s always an inherent isolation. Of not fitting in anywhere. Of not knowing anyone else like you. Until my 20s, I was even stateless, and couldn’t get a passport from any country. So I felt a very deep sense of isolation. You have to cherish your own uniqueness, but you also have to learn how to adapt in order to survive. It’s exhausting.</p>\n<p><strong>Let’s get more into identity. What is your experience been as a gay man on top of everything else? I&#8217;m especially curious about being gay in the context of being Mormon.</strong></p>\n<p>That was really tough for me, because I was very religious in high school and earlier. I was a Boy Scout, I went to Mormon summer camps in Utah, and I planned to go on a mission. I tried very hard to be the perfect Mormon boy. And it took me a really, really long time to reconcile that. When you have this belief system that doesn&#8217;t include you, you have to figure out how you fit in or not. Eventually, I realized I didn&#8217;t fit in, and I became a much healthier person afterwards because I didn&#8217;t hate myself. In San Francisco, we still have some diversity left, so I don&#8217;t really feel too separate in terms of the gay facet of my identity. I feel lucky about that.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;When you come from poverty and you’re also gay, Cambodian, Mormon, and a refugee of war, there’s always an inherent isolation.

You have to cherish your own uniqueness, but you also have to learn how to adapt in order to survive. It’s exhausting.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>On the flip side, I don&#8217;t know how active you are socially in the gay community, but what is it like being a techie in the gay community? Total other side of the coin.</strong></p>\n<p>Ah, this is an interesting topic. What’s sad is the mainstreaming of gay culture. I talked about this recently with my partner, Harold. When I was growing up, being gay was synonymous with being rebellious and iconoclastic. You were expected to be different. It was still taboo, but it afforded you a great amount of freedom and space to express yourself.</p>\n<p>The world has made a lot of progress in acceptance of gay people, but a side effect is that assimilation has happened. Gay folks are in the mainstream, but they fit into what is acceptable. In media, they’re usually normalized into caricatures of what’s expected: wealthy white men who fun, attractive, and inoffensive. Yet there&#8217;s a full spectrum of people who still aren’t represented—there&#8217;s poor gay people, there&#8217;s gay people of color, there’s lesbians, there&#8217;s trans, there’s gender non-conformists, there’s gay people who are angry, and there’s people who have sex with the same gender but aren’t “gay.” So I&#8217;m saddened by the mainstreaming of gay culture, because I wish we had a greater representation of difference and all of the in-between states.</p>\n<p>Most sad of all, is how mainstream San Francisco has become. One of my best friends, Sean, moved to the East Bay recently, and he was like, &#8220;Yeah, I wondered where all the people with the weird haircuts went. They&#8217;re all here in the East Bay!&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>My next question, which we&#8217;re already touching on—what&#8217;s it like being both a techie and local?</strong></p>\n<p>In some ways, it&#8217;s really fun because I feel like I&#8217;m getting to do what I love in the place I grew up in. But, San Francisco has changed a lot. Oakland is changing even more. Many things have been lost because of how much tech has transformed the area. I miss that.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m in a rent-controlled apartment in San Francisco, and I can&#8217;t actually afford to move back to Oakland. It&#8217;s just really crazy because I spent all this time trying to escape Oakland, and then I can&#8217;t actually afford to go back. It&#8217;s very ironic. I touched on it a little bit when my friend made the comment about haircuts in the East Bay—San Francisco just isn&#8217;t as diverse as it once was. It&#8217;s very homogenous, and that&#8217;s increasingly getting harder for me to accept. It&#8217;s heartbreaking.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in a rent-controlled apartment in San Francisco, and I can&#8217;t actually afford to move back to Oakland. It&#8217;s just really crazy because I spent all this time trying to escape Oakland, and then I can&#8217;t actually afford to go back. It&#8217;s very ironic.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>I used to think I’d live in San Francisco for the rest of my life because it&#8217;s just so open, diverse, and you can live how you want to live. But when toast is $5 dollars, it’s kinda crazy. I actually love the $5 toast, but when that’s the norm, and there is not much deviation, it’s obscene.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you expand on what’s been lost?</strong></p>\n<p>My partner is much more conscious about social justice, diversity, and oppression. He&#8217;s definitely made me more attuned to those issues. For example, the queer arts in San Francisco is dying because it’s getting pushed out by rising rent prices, evictions, and a lack of studio spaces.</p>\n<p>My techie side says, &#8220;Oh, well. It just means, as an artist, you have to adapt, and try to figure out who the audience is and cater to your audience”. The other side of me is like, &#8220;Wow. That&#8217;s a really shitty thing to say. These are people that have a particular point of view and a particular statement they want to make, and you&#8217;re telling them they need to suppress that?”</p>\n<p>The fact is, their way of expression is being taken away from them. I have to constantly ask myself, &#8220;Am I part of the problem or am I not?&#8221; It&#8217;s very, very complicated and I’m not sure what the answer is.</p>\n<p><strong>How do your friends and family from growing up feel about how you turned out?</strong></p>\n<p>I think they&#8217;re all super excited for me. My mom still doesn&#8217;t really know what I do. She doesn&#8217;t have an understanding of technology but my siblings do. And I feel good in that I can set an example. I wish I could write an autobiography that was like, “I grew up poor, then bootstrapped myself, and did it all by myself,” but the reality is that I had a lot of help and people who believed in me. I had mentors, I had family that watched out for me, I had amazing teachers. I feel like it was definitely like a group effort, and so, I hope I continue being a good example for others. More importantly, I strive to help others in the same way others have supported me.</p>\n<p><strong>What would you say are your biggest motivators? What drives you?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, I had this experience growing up where I had to do a lot of translation and filling out of forms for my mother who didn’t speak English. That made me aware of things that may be invisible to others, like the design of forms, for example. So there&#8217;s a notion of service design that I get really interested in. How do you help others accomplish what they need to get done to survive or excel? Answering that question is a huge motivation for me. It&#8217;s partly why I started <a href=\"https://mixmax.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mixmax</a> with my friends, Olof and Brad. I wanted to make something that would actually help people do their own work better in order to succeed.</p>\n<p>My life with my family and partner is also a major motivator for me. I’m driven to help support them. I believe when you succeed in your personal life, you also succeed in your professional life. It’s not about “balancing” work and life, but about creating flexibility in each so that both areas can succeed.</p>\n<p><strong>Let&#8217;s go macro for a second. How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? What excites you, what frustrates you?</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m extremely excited about software for professionals. It&#8217;s so cool to see how people use existing pro tools for their work. The current tools are really, really awful. It&#8217;s just amazing to me how much we focus on consumer products, but there&#8217;s this world of professional software that needs great design. So it’s very exciting to think about those possibilities.</p>\n<p>What’s frustrating? Everyone is so entitled. It’s definitely a bubble in the Bay Area where people feel like they deserve the world, because they happen to be an in-demand tech person living here. Super, super frustrating. It’s refreshing to talk to people outside Silicon Valley, who are also hungry to learn and grow, but have a lot less entitlement.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Always ask yourself, &#8216;How can I exceed expectations?&#8217; Set explicit goals and push yourself to achieve more than what was previously asked of you.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Lastly, what advice would you give to folks from similar backgrounds to you who are really interested in tech but just not quite sure how to get into it and succeed?</strong></p>\n<p>Gosh, let&#8217;s see. Well, one tip is to don&#8217;t be afraid to approach the people you admire and recruit them as mentors. You might be hesitant to reach out to people, because you think they&#8217;ll flat out reject you. For the most part, I have found that many people are willing to help and are awesome about it.</p>\n<p>Another tip: always ask yourself, “How can I exceed expectations?” Set explicit goals and push yourself to achieve more than what was previously asked of you. I learned this from Google and from my time at Dubberly. Hugh phrased it as “pulling a rabbit out of a hat.” Overachievement increases the chances for success and learning.</p>\n<p>My last advice is to foster a wide variety of interests that make you happy. Tech might not be what fulfills you in the end, so consider other things that could also make you happy, and at the same time, viable as a living. Even within tech, there are many hats to wear, many subjects to explore, and many products to design. It&#8217;s super open.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

It&#8217;s a pretty affluent area, but very diverse. I&#8217;ve realized in retrospect that it&#8217;s really out there in terms of median income, but actually has a lot of diverse immigrant populations. People are drawn towards working in D.C. Not a bad place to grow up, I would say. But it’s way more interesting with context about what the rest of the world is like—realizing how affluent and diverse the area is.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I went to University of Virginia for undergrad and felt very out of place, and so I buried myself in more and more work. I got a double major and a masters in four years.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Interesting. So, you were a nerdy kid. Did you feel that you were technically inclined early on?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would say I was technically inclined. My parents were really supportive of my education. Even in elementary school, I was going to a local high school to take math classes and classes in Computer Science. I drew away from technical work for a while when I didn’t see there was creative work there, but now that I’ve come back to it it feels like a nerdy home for me.</span></p>\n<p><b>Walk me through those early education years,going to college, and then eventually making your way all the way across the country.</b></p>\n<p>I went to University of Virginia for undergrad and felt very out of place, and so I buried myself in more and more work. I got a double major and a masters in four years. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I very much identified with being a great student. So at the end of my undergrad, I went straight into graduate school doing research. I got into MIT for a PHD program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MIT was great for me in a lot of ways. MIT is such a hot bed of engineering creativity in a way that I hadn’t experienced before. UVA was very focused on business and their law school, so I hadn&#8217;t seen that engineering could be for things besides a well paying job. MIT has people programming LED everything for fun, building roller coasters out of plywood: things that I found very inspirational. And at the same time I was seeing creativity in engineering, I found that even though my graduate work was very interesting technically, it wasn&#8217;t drawing my attention. It didn&#8217;t have an immediate impact on the world. </span></p>\n<p>Over time I realized that maybe I could be happier if I was doing something else. So I tried a software engineering internship. It wasn&#8217;t quite the place for me, but I realized I thought I could be happy doing software engineering somewhere else. After that, I ended up finding my current job, dropping out of grad school, and moving to San Francisco.</p>\n<p><b>What were your first impressions of Silicon Valley? What were you expecting? How did it live up to &#8211; or not live up to &#8211; what you had thought it would be? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’d had an internship at Berkeley one summer when I was 21. I stayed in a dorm at Berkeley, but was way shyer then. I was like: &#8220;Oh my gosh, this is the promised land. There are so many cool people walking around. If only I wasn&#8217;t too shy to talk to everyone I would be so happy and feel so at place here.&#8221;</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Just to be in a city where I didn&#8217;t feel weird was so liberating.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And my move to San Francisco was just so dominated by becoming way more comfortable with myself. And in particular, at this sense of weirdness that I don&#8217;t think is necessarily caused by being queer, but that is very correlated for me. </span>Just to be in a city where I didn&#8217;t feel weird was so liberating.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So my first year here, I was happy just to party and explore in a way most people felt comfortable enough to do in college. I had fun!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But at that point, I didn&#8217;t quite get cultural context on a lot of things. Criticisms of privilege in tech weren’t on my radar at that point, or cultural critiques of privilege in the city. I was just thinking about how it was a fun party, and touching that for the first time. Just trying to find my place at that point.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I felt very much like even a technical outsider, especially as the first inexperienced coder at my company. And that challenge concentrated me. I focused for eight hours a day in such an intense way I didn&#8217;t listen to music, didn&#8217;t look at my cell phone at all.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Workwise, even though I had a technical background and plenty of CS classes, I hadn’t had as much experience coding as many people who work at top jobs here. I was very prepared in some ways and not quite totally prepared in others. </span>I felt very much like even a technical outsider, especially as the first inexperienced coder at my company. And that challenge concentrated me. I focused for eight hours a day in such an intense way I didn&#8217;t listen to music, didn&#8217;t look at my cell phone at all.</p>\n<p><b>Totally. I can so relate on the weird thing. I&#8217;m from North Carolina, like super close to where you&#8217;re from. People use the word weird all the time in North Carolina just to denote anything. Like, &#8220;Oh, that meal is weird,&#8221; or like, &#8220;That outfit is weird.&#8221; Weird is used all the time. Then I came here and I was like, &#8220;Oh my God. Nothing&#8217;s weird and everything&#8217;s weird at the same time.&#8221; That word doesn&#8217;t even work here. It was just so cool to suddenly—I was weird in North Carolina because I&#8217;m pale and wore black too much, things that are super normal here or in New York or whatever. Being intellectual. All of that was weird. Here it&#8217;s like, there is no such thing as weird anymore and that is the most amazing feeling. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">God bless SF.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Seriously. So walk me through your experience working in tech so far. What is exciting to you about your work? </strong></p>\n<p>I’d coded before, but hadn&#8217;t thought about code as a means of communication. Basically, I was missing an appreciation of software engineering. Software engineering asks questions like “How do you write code that is easily understandable by other people?”, and “How do you write in a way that&#8217;s resilient to a bunch of unknown changes in the future?” Good software engineering is thoughtful, compassionate, and thorough.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike most kinds of engineering, changing code means you can change your product every single day &#8211; so things can happen very quickly. It&#8217;s such a collaborative media, because software engineers are all collaboratively writing a huge document of code together. There&#8217;s a lot of coordination there that I find really interesting. And on top of that, I really appreciate making something, a product, that I use everyday and that people use everyday to make their lives better. For me, it’s just the right way to merge technical work with thoughtfulness about other people.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’d coded before, but hadn&#8217;t thought about code as a means of communication.

It&#8217;s combining mentorship, and talking people through their feelings in a way that I don&#8217;t think they often get to do inside of tech. That’s such a special combination of things that I have. So many of my one-on-ones are long walks up Potrero with cherry trees are magnolia trees, and that’s such a nice balance to writing software.</span></p>\n<p><b>What have been some struggles for you ? For instance, you mentioned in your preinterview the flipside of being a badass queer woman in tech. Expand on that for me.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure. I got feedback from my manager that the way I presented myself didn’t always come across as technical and professional. And in some ways that was definitely true. We have an open bar at the office and I would be sipping scotch at 3 P.M. But, also, hearing that as queer woman, I couldn’t help but react as, &#8220;Yeah, of course I don’t look and act like straight white dudes.&#8221; Not that I don’t like the white dudes that I work with, but that feedback hit me in a way that made me cry. With work though, I came around to realizing that it&#8217;s no one’s job to make anyone feel welcome, and that’s not the purpose of the company. But now I’ve come around to the flipside of that &#8212; that</span> there&#8217;s a business case for making sure that everyone feels included in the company.<b> </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had to go through all those emotional cycles of  &#8212; no one has to take care of me, but also I hope there are businesses out there that do recognize me.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a business case for making sure that everyone feels included in the company.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And I do feel recognized by my company. I&#8217;ve gotten promotions, I&#8217;ve gotten to start managing, things like that. But I still often have feelings like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t look like tech,&#8221; or, &#8220;Is it cool enough to work in tech?&#8221; For myself, I often wonder, am I working with people that most directly bring out my best? I think working inside tech as a queer woman is a beautiful place to enact some kinds of change. I&#8217;m one of the most vocal advocate for diversity inside my company. But no one&#8217;s encouraging me on to do that, and so I wonder, am I growing the social responsibility parts of myself? In my current job, I’m definitely growing some emotional parts of myself, I’m definitely growing the technical parts of myself, but I don&#8217;t have direct role models for social responsibility in a way that I do think is very important in life.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, for sure. You don&#8217;t want to feel that your actions are in a silo.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. I&#8217;m changing my company for the better, but how important is it that any specific tech company gets better? I&#8217;m starting to speak at external events, but I don&#8217;t know if I’m changing things. Certainly, it makes me feel like more complete of a person if I have a chance to speak what I think is socially righteous. But I have to wonder &#8211; is this effective? And who is asking me if this is effective? Who is caring?</span></p>\n<p>&#8220;Sometimes, it&#8217;s lonely. Other people don&#8217;t talk about diversity as much as I do—probably because they don’t have feel the lack of it in their core. So I try to translate my feelings into, &#8216;What is the business case for us?&#8217; in a way that&#8217;s indisputably worth pursuing.&#8221;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My company is supportive. I just wrote a piece on diversity that we published on our company blog. And I’m so proud that we&#8217;re willing to do that. I do try to put diversity conversations into language that I think is approachable for people of privilege, and appreciate my company&#8217;s support as I’ve grown into being able to make that switch of language, from anger to something productive.</span></p>\n<p><b>I want to get into privilege for a second. What is it like for you kind of straddling multiple worlds, some of which are privileged such as tech, and some of which aren&#8217;t as much, like being a woman and being queer?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think about  privilege so much more than most of tech. I guess that happens anytime there are marginalized groups. </span>Sometimes, it&#8217;s lonely. Other people don&#8217;t talk about diversity as much as I do&#8211; probably because they don’t have feel the lack of it in their core. So I try to translate my feelings into,&#8221;What is the business case for us?&#8221; in a way that&#8217;s indisputably worth pursuing.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There is a radicalness to being a queer woman in a group of privilege, just being in tech myself. It’s kind of radical that I&#8217;m working here, and surviving, and thriving.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s really easy to forget my duality in either context. When I met my girlfriend, she was working with homeless women a few blocks from my office. Dating her, I’ve gotten to feel and learn about both &#8220;tech sucks, it has so much privilege and it doesn&#8217;t talk about its privilege,&#8221; and, &#8220;Wait, there’s some surprising positive things in tech.&#8221; She’s so political, I don’t think she ever would have guessed that she would date someone in tech. But then also—</span>there is a radicalness to being a queer woman in a group of privilege, just being in tech myself. It’s kind of radical that I&#8217;m working here, and surviving, and thriving.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of times in queer communities, I do often feel out of place for working in a field of such privilege, but I do feel proud of that as long as I’m thinking about what social justice means there. So there’s nuance. Yes, I work in tech, but I’m trying to live that authentically and consciously.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Where have you found your support networks here?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My manager at Asana talks to me about everything through the lens of feelings, which is how I like to communicate. I appreciate mentorship from someone who is so multilingual: </span>it’s rare to be able to talk about both feelings and technical work. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of my support has been external to work, because I need acknowledgement that it is work to be diverse and there are feelings that go along with that—and that&#8217;s not a conversation that happens much inside such a non-diverse field. My biggest support over the last few years, and someone who&#8217;s really increased my language around privilege in tech, is my girlfriend—she&#8217;s wonderful. And I do have to call out both of my parents as well.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It’s rare to be able to talk about both feelings and technical work.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Have there been any specific mentors or people that have been super pivotal in your career?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My manager has been very encouraging, though I haven&#8217;t worked with him directly on a team. But a lot of the growth that I&#8217;ve done is towards being able to run solo and having confidence in that. I’ve internalized over the last couple of years when you work inside a company, someone is deciding what work you&#8217;re doing. And definitely it is very liberating to have your own strong opinions about what I should be working on. I’ve been supported into having my own opinions and helping direct my own work, and also have input into what my team should be working on and how we work together. Inside most tech companies there&#8217;s less hierarchy and more making sure that lots of people are empowered. That&#8217;s been very positive for me.</span></p>\n<p><b>What is important to you in a job now versus the beginning?</b></p>\n<p>When I was applying for my first job from the East Coast, it was so hard to tell what companies were looking for, or to evaluate all the promises companies made. And so I just ended up working at the place I felt most emotionally comfortable. I loved that their job posting included not just technical requirements, but also their company values as well. I was really excited at the prospect of a job that was going to appreciate me for more than just my technical skills. Now that I&#8217;ve been in Silicon Valley for a few years, I recognize the nuance of how business models influence what you&#8217;re actually working on, of how specific engineering practices relate to your day-to-day, and how much time you have to spend fixing old issues as opposed to working on new features.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I want white dudes to notice when they’re in rooms of all white dudes, and to acknowledge that it’s an issue.I’ve been in meetings that were 17 men and me. And I was so distracted the whole time. I kept going around and counting how many men were in the meeting with me because I just felt it so much. I really appreciated afterwards someone came up to me afterwards and said, &#8216;Did you notice you were the only woman in that meeting? That was weird.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And now I’m even more appreciative of being recognized as a whole person. I can imagine myself stuck at another company just typing code. At my current job, I&#8217;m appreciated for my emotional skills through management, I&#8217;m appreciated for my opinions about how products should be formed. That&#8217;s let me grow into a more well-rounded career, and let me pick my passions. It’s given the space for me to advocate strongly for diversity work and be a part of the process too. I’ve been part of the process as my company recognized diversity and inclusion work is a full time job, and as we hired someone into that roll, and I still feel listened to for my input. </span></p>\n<p><b>Let&#8217;s talk more about your opinions on that—like what do you think tech could be doing better right now to be more accommodating to diversity?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest thing is not only acknowledging how un-diverse tech is, but acknowledging in the day to day that that’s an issue, and believing it’s worth fixing. </span>I want white dudes to notice when they’re in rooms of all white dudes, and to acknowledge that it’s an issue. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though I work at an extremely thoughtful company—our numbers aren’t great. My engineering team is 9% women, let alone queerness, let alone groups I’m not even parts of, that I’m uncomfortable that we’re missing.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’m looking for humility from tech, stating that we own and acknowledge the lack of diversity is a problem and it’s our problem, or even just showing more complex understanding of the fact that they&#8217;re part of an issue. It makes me so pissed every time I hear someone say it&#8217;s a pipeline issue. Especially when you look at how many people are graduating with degrees from college with computer science degrees, and Silicon Valley is nowhere near as diverse as that. So you can talk about a pipeline issue, but that is not acknowledging your own flaws. I think that a first step is at least recognizing and validating the experience of the people that are out there.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>I’ve been in meetings that were 17 men and me.

What really excites you and what frustrates you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s lots exciting about tech. I&#8217;m personally excited about tech in enterprise, which is creating things quickly as applied to how people do productive things. I appreciate getting to make something of value that’s such a core part of people&#8217;s workflows.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Tech has so much potential, I think it&#8217;s worth being frustrated about because I love it and I think we could be doing better.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What pisses me off the most is lack of acknowledgement of privilege and what that means. And that’s nothing new—there have always been so many industries with money who don&#8217;t recognize that. </span>Tech has so much potential, I think it&#8217;s worth being frustrated about because I love it and I think we could be doing better.</p>\n<p><b>How do you think your background and life experience impact the way that you approach your work?</b></p>\n<p>My queerness has made me so emotional, and I think there&#8217;s so much room for emotional coders. It definitely makes me think about communication way more deeply.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And that applies even more clearly to management than technical work. There is lots of room for emotional coaching in encouraging people to grow into responsibility, and I do that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My best job before software engineering was as a summer camp counselor, and it&#8217;s just so funny how parallel some of those experiences are, in trying to find and share joy, and embarking on this huge collaborative journey together, whatever it is.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;My queerness has made me so emotional, and I think there&#8217;s so much room for emotional coders.

I’m growing into a mature person in this city. It&#8217;s not brand new for me anymore!</span></p>\n<p><strong>My last question for you would be what advice would you have for folks from similar backgrounds or facing similar struggles, hoping to get into tech?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work your network or work whatever is closest to your network. I have such a soft spot for people that I connect with emotionally, and talking them through application processes, whether it&#8217;s my company or even somewhere else. There are people who resonate with you, and it will bring them joy to help you find a job that&#8217;s going to make you happy. Like, if I&#8217;m going to be a marginalized person in tech, then part of my purpose is to help my kind, so if it&#8217;s not me I&#8217;m sure they can find someone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Especially, traditional networking made me very uncomfortable in lots of ways, like feeling very insincere. And I think a lot of that didn&#8217;t seem my type, or my type of small talk even. But </span>there are people out there—there are companies out there that are going to value your full personality. There&#8217;s enough jobs in tech that you can find one that is right for you, that accepts you, that is excited by you.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are people out there—there are companies out there that are going to value your full personality.

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b></b><b>Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born in the Philippines. I’m ¾ Filipina and ¼ Austrian. I understand Tagalog and I speak elementary German. I have lived in the Philippines, Germany, and all over the United States (Connecticut, Nebraska, Missouri, California, New York, Boston). My family relocated a lot because of work, so from an early age I was comfortable with the idea of constant change and impermanence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was a hard worker and rather ambitious for as long as I can remember. For example, in the third grade, there were these boxes with cards in various colors for different topics like math, language, science, etc. Every day you were supposed to do three. I remember feeling rather competitive and ambitious (with myself, not against other classmates) and I would want to finish the whole box as fast as I could. So what I would do is, I would steal a large quantity of cards, take them home, and then I would work on them the whole day. Sometimes it’d be 9:00 PM and my mom would be like, &#8220;Why are you still working?&#8221;. I would lie and tell her that it was homework and I recall she was so perplexed &#8211; how can a third grader have so much homework? My teachers were also perplexed at how I managed to finish boxes and boxes of cards during school hours, but for me, it was just fun. </span></p>\n<p><b>How did you first discover tech and get into tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I first learned about tech at Stanford. When I started at Stanford, I was certain I would become an investment banker and work for Goldman Sachs. My grand life ambition at the time was to one day become the CEO of Goldman Sachs and I had to start now! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One day, my best friend was telling me how she discovered the tech industry and how she wanted to “do start-ups”. I asked her what that meant and she said,</span> &#8220;Well, in tech you have a really scrappy attitude. So, let’s say you don’t have a table. What do you do? Well, you don’t buy a table. You don’t have time for that. You grab a box, then you rip down the door, you put the door on top of the box, and ta-da! You have a table. That’s how scrappy you have to be when you do start-ups.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;If I’m going to be CEO one day it might as well be now.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her “how to make a table” story made such an impression on me. It was the seed of ever considering doing a start-up because I could see myself thriving in an environment with other people who shared that scrappy attitude.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I continued to pursue my investment banking dream. I became the president of the investment club, did internships at top banks every single summer and even during the year, and eventually got an offer from J.P. Morgan in New York for their Leveraged Finance division. But the truth was, by the time I experienced the “New York banker lifestyle” that I always dreamed of, I was deeply unfulfilled. I remember asking my boss, “If I put in the best work possible and have the skill-set of an Associate a year from now, will you promote me?” And he said, “No, it doesn’t matter how good you are, you still have to do 3 years and then go to business school for 2 years and only then can you become an Associate.” This didn’t sit well with me and long story short (after relinquishing my “banker identity” that I had held on to for so long) I decided I was going to start a company.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I realized that if I wanted infinite skill-set growth and no system to hold me back, that I could make this work if I created a profitable company by the time I graduated from college. I had one year.</span> If I’m going to be CEO one day it might as well be now.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking back at this rejection of the J.P. Morgan offer and starting the journey on the scrappy startup path, I now see that this was the beginning of my ability to reject a traditional hierarchical system that I used to follow so strictly. Back then, I based my personal worth on my company name and job title, and back then, it needed to be Goldman Sachs and CEO. Rejecting that value system, however, has helped me realize that my value lies in deciding what I want to do and then making it happen. </span>I no longer had to knock on someone&#8217;s door, play by the rules, form myself into “this perfect person” with a prestigious job and title. Now, I could simply decide what I wanted to happen and then make it happen.</p>\n<p>A week after I turned down my “dream job”, I started teaching myself static front-end web development (HTML/CSS). I made a website all about how to get top investment banking internships (because that was the only topic I could write about in great detail that would be valuable to many at the time). My first business taught students all about how to prepare for finance interviews, how to write great resumes, how to get top internships. I wrote all the content, wrote all the HTML/CSS web pages, hooked up PayPal to sell my resume review and interview prep service, then I put it online and made it a real thing.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I no longer had to knock on someone&#8217;s door, play by the rules, form myself into “this perfect person” with a prestigious job and title. Now, I could simply decide what I wanted to happen and then make it happen.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, that was my first tech-enabled small business. I saw the full stack, from the web development to actually providing a service to my customers. Its growth motivated me to do something bigger and something not about finance. But I could see it now. I could see how if I made this my craft, I could make something really impactful.</span></p>\n<p>Four months later, I started my first “real” tech company. The first idea that got me really excited was basically Airbnb for tourism. I wanted to build a site that sold fun and unique tour experiences like “Espresso Bar Hopping in SF’s Mission District”. I was a single founder with grit and an idea. There was an upcoming Entrepreneurship class and I decided that my goal was to take the class and make revenues by the end of the class so that I could work on this full time after graduation.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the course of the quarter I led a team of students. Since I was the only technical person on the team, I designed and wrote another basic website and integrated with PayPal. My team and I created real tours on campus, one was a design workshop at the D School, another was a tour of the Solar Car team’s workspace, for example. We sold our first tours and we were in business. If I recall correctly, my teacher said we were probably the first team ever to make revenues during the class in the history of the class. Shortly after, I recruited a technical co-founder and we decided to really build this as a business with the joint goal that we had to grow our revenues enough so that we could support ourselves full time after graduation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the things we did was apply to <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Y Combinator</a>. My co-founder was obsessed with being a “YC Company” but I didn’t really see what the hype was. I remember in our interview with Paul Graham he said, “You’re talented but I hate your idea. Change it, apply again, and we’ll accept you.” And both of us were like&#8230;hell no. We’re not changing our idea because you told us to! We’re founders!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually though, as we did the math on our revenues, we realized, &#8220;Shit. We&#8217;re not going to make enough money if we don&#8217;t do something to accelerate our revenue growth ASAP.&#8221; Graduation was coming up. So, we started frantically calling tour operators, because we reasoned that if they knew how to sell tours well that we could learn a thing or two from them. This was a stressful time because I had to learn how to cold-call. I remember waking up at eight in the morning &#8211; which was an ungodly time to be awake as a student &#8211; calling these people, stuttering, and then getting hung up on. It sucked! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then one person hung up on my co-founder, and he was fed up with it. And my co-founder said, &#8221;You know what? I&#8217;m going to call him back. And I&#8217;m going to say, &#8221;Don&#8217;t hung up on me, talk to me.&#8221; Ballsy, but that’s why I admired him. So he called again and the tour operator said, “You know what kid? I like you. You really want to help me? Build software for me.” We realized many of these tour operators were running their businesses on spreadsheets and whiteboards and quickly changed our pitch to cold-calling them and saying, “Hey we’re two Stanford kids who can make software for you—how much will you pay us?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This became our new line of business. This time around, people were much more interested and some of them had such a “hair on fire need” that they wanted to meet us at 7am the very next day. We got our first customers that way and quickly made enough revenues to cover our cost of living within the first three months of running the business. I graduated, was able to move to San Francisco, pay rent. This was in 2011 and I was paying $600/mo to share a studio but you know what, I had my own company and we were killin’ it!</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I worked for a start-up for a few months, was a personal trainer for a few weeks, had many side gigs, I did a bunch of random, random things. I was searching<b>.&#8221;</b></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually, running this business was no longer fulfilling. I realized that at the end of the day, all my efforts went towards making tourism software and helping tour operators save time and money. The day to day work was far from glamorous. Suddenly, I couldn’t see myself working on this “for the rest of my life” like I could when I first started, because we had rapidly pivoted our business into “whatever would pay us a bunch of money” without giving a care about whether this was actually the direction we wanted to take our lives. I was about 22 years old so it was great to learn this lesson early on in life. I decided I was going to leave the company and that in the future, I would very carefully choose who my customers are. Because if I’m going to spend all my time catering to their needs, I want to make a more meaningful impact at a deeply personal level. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that was basically the end of that company (for me). A whole year went by. </span>I worked for a start-up for a few months, was a personal trainer for a few weeks, had many side gigs, I did a bunch of random, random things. I was searching<b>.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> One of the random life-changing things I did was attend <a href=\"http://www.railsbridge.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Railsbridge</a>, a free 2-day ruby on rails seminar for women. After this seminar I realized I was pretty good at Rails and wanted to really learn how to code so that I could build and test other start-up ideas rapidly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is how <a href=\"http://spitfireathlete.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Spitfire</a> started. It was my chosen “coding project”. I wanted to build a site called “Spitfire” that was a place where badass women could go to be with other badass women and become stronger, smarter, and inspired. There was something exciting about the identity of “a spitfire” that I captured in early versions of the site that kept me learning Ruby, Rails, Javascript, and that kept me developing the idea.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon, I was immersed into learning to code. Every time I would learn something new, I would add/modify Spitfire, then show it to people and ask for their thoughts. Months later, I had a mobile web strength training app that people were actually using. Since the mobile web app was so popular, I decided to make it a real native iOS app and started learning Objective-C/iOS.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Every time VCs or investors would say things like, &#8216;I can’t see this being a large market,&#8217; or otherwise express disbelief it would definitely annoy me, but not discourage me, because in my gut all of those interactions with customers that I had were just proving their opinions wrong.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually, the iOS app had about 100 people using the beta, and that&#8217;s around the time when I realized that this can be a real brand. A real business. I recruited my co-founder Nidhi Kulkarni, an extremely talented engineer from MIT who was also a D1 NCAA lightweight rower in college. I met her at a party and we connected as both women in tech and female athletes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon, we had an app that was ready for submission to the App Store. This was a really exciting time because we didn&#8217;t think anything would happen. We thought it&#8217;d be a big achievement if we got 1000 of our friends to use it. But something crazy happened. Apple ended up featuring it on the front page that first week we launched, and we were stunned. We were stunned that this thing we created was viewed as good enough by Apple to be featured on the home page. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We couldn’t get any work done that day. We just kept looking at our dashboard and seeing downloads go up and up. That’s when we realized that there was something here that was much bigger than what we previously thought. This app is no longer for hardcore athletes like us. It’s a product that resonates with the everyday woman who aspires to train and develop her inner athlete. And that’s huge.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;If we don’t actually make women stronger, if our work doesn’t help instill true confidence from within, then we are failing. You have to be really careful in the health and fitness industry because if you don’t think deeply about your language, your photography, your diet recommendations, you can actually hurt and hamper people at scale and cause people to have low self esteem and eating disorders.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have come a long way since then. Over the last few years we raised funding from <a href=\"http://www.techstars.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TechStars</a>, launched a successful 179% funded Kickstarter, got featured in major news publications like Washington Post and ABC/CBS news, have recently reached our milestone of 100k users and are making our first revenues through our premium subscription offering.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, those are just the successes. I’m not quite ready to discuss the hardships we have gone through at length just yet but one of the toughest years we had was 2015 when my co-founder’s mother passed away. She was with her family in New Jersey for a good chunk of that year. Our progress slowed to a crawl and I actually got pretty depressed while she was gone. So we definitely have had ups and downs.</span></p>\n<p><b>What do you think are the biggest motivators behind your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am the most motivated about building Spitfire into an eternal resource that truly helps women build their mental and physical strength and that grows into a brand that truly represents the female athlete within. </span>If we don’t actually make women stronger, if our work doesn’t help instill true confidence from within, then we are failing. You have to be really careful in the health and fitness industry because if you don’t think deeply about your language, your photography, your diet recommendations, you can actually hurt and hamper people at scale and cause people to have low self esteem and eating disorders.</p>\n<p>I want to help women internalize that they are strong, powerful, independent.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I care a lot about that transformation and it&#8217;s both physical and mental. I view Spitfire as a vehicle to take that transformation and allow a lot of people to experience that for themselves in their own way.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I want to help women internalize that they are strong, powerful, independent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We definitely have already seen the transformative effect of Spitfire on various women’s lives, but I still feel like we have a lot of work to do and a long journey ahead. This mental and physical transformation into one’s most confident and independent self is one of the most exciting things that Spitfire can offer. That&#8217;s the part of spitfire that I’m really excited about.</span></p>\n<p><b>How did you learn not to get discouraged when people disagreed with your idea behind Spitfire?</b></p>\n<p>From very early on, when I would talk to various women about Spitfire, they would just get so excited. Their eyes would light up and they would say things like, “I need that in my life! That’s for me.”</p>\n<p>So, every time VCs or investors would say things like, “I can’t see this being a large market” or otherwise express disbelief it would definitely annoy me, but not discourage me, because in my gut all of those interactions with customers that I had were just proving their opinions wrong.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;At first, I was kind of like, &#8216;Oh no, he&#8217;s disagreeing! He’s a big prestigious VC and he’s disagreeing!&#8217; And then eventually I would just conclude, &#8216;Wow, this guy is an idiot.&#8217; But I would still be nice. And smile. And then eventually I just decided, &#8216;You know what? I’m tired of hearing this shit. I’m going to argue back and tell them that they’re wrong.&#8217; And the first time I told a VC that he was straight out wrong, it felt so good. He was surprised. We couldn’t come to an agreement, but I felt badass as fuck for standing my ground.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back when I was just getting started, whenever random people said things like, &#8220;Oh, no one&#8217;s going to actually use this.&#8221; I couldn’t help but think, “Wait a second. Every single interaction and every single data point with a customer tells me otherwise.” Eventually all of those interactions and data points solidified my intuition. </span>At first, I was kind of like, &#8220;Oh no, he&#8217;s disagreeing! He’s a big prestigious VC and he’s disagreeing!&#8221; And then eventually I would just conclude, &#8220;Wow, this guy is an idiot.&#8221; But I would still be nice. And smile.

We couldn’t come to an agreement, but I felt badass as fuck for standing my ground.</p>\n<p><b>How do feel like you fit into Silicon Valley culture? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I fit in well with other engineers. I enjoy meeting with the types of engineers who care about what they’re working on, who have side projects and who tinker with new technologies because they’re excited about it. Who are always building things. Trying to get better. I really get along with those types of engineers. Brogrammers—not so much.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;When it comes to venture capital, funding, large tech companies, and the &#8216;grow fast and become a rocket ship&#8217; mindset, I disassociate with that and view myself as an outsider to those types of belief systems.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also fit in very well with the women in tech community. I see or hang out with other women and tech and have this sense of calm, I feel like, “these are my people!”</span></p>\n<p>However, when it comes to venture capital, funding, large tech companies, and the “grow fast and become a rocket ship” mindset, I disassociate with that and view myself as an outsider to those types of belief systems.</p>\n<p>It feels like there are people who work inside “big tech company” paradise, and then I view me and my co-founder as wolves on the outside, in the snow, hunting for food every day. We’re just in a very different mental and physical place.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel proud to say, &#8220;I learned to code and built a great product with my co-founder.&#8221; But I don&#8217;t feel like, &#8220;I&#8217;m in tech and being in this industry resonates with me.&#8221; Because it doesn&#8217;t. So that&#8217;s kind of a sensitive topic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My identity doesn&#8217;t really lie with tech, it lies more with the strength community and especially women&#8217;s empowerment, badassery, strength training community.</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m curious how you found strength training in the first place.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was an avid runner in college, I ran multiple marathons and half marathons. After several knee injuries, I decided to learn how to squat. From there, I learned I really liked the weight room and how it felt to lift and build muscle. Running helped me develop the ability to endure tough times, but weight training helped me develop the ability to take on tough times with strength and power.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It feels like there are people who work inside &#8216;big tech company&#8217; paradise, and then I view me and my co-founder as wolves on the outside, in the snow, hunting for food every day. We’re just in a very different mental and physical place.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got into Olympic style weightlifting because a trainer at my local gym saw my potential encouraged me to compete in the sport. I didn’t even know the sport existed! “There’s a competition in two weeks, I&#8217;ll train you for free.&#8221; I learned the snatch and the clean and jerk that day and competed two weeks later. I was already able to clean and jerk my body weight and snatch 85% of my bodyweight in two weeks, so I realized I had potential to be pretty good at this sport. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I fell in love with weightlifting because I wanted to train feeling badass at every single training day. Why train to critique one’s body in a mirror when you can train to feel so good about what you just lifted and how you lifted it?</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in the future?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I see Spitfire as a healthy and growing (but still young) child. I think we&#8217;re going to have a small team. </span>We are not going to be one of those &#8220;grow as fast as possible&#8221; companies, but one that has a very clear sense of what it stands for and that forges ahead on its own and at it&#8217;s own pace.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It doesn&#8217;t try to rush, or it doesn&#8217;t try to push itself when it doesn&#8217;t need to. It blossoms on it&#8217;s own so I see myself still at the helm of that, and guiding it, and working with a bigger but still tight knit team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I believe Spitfire is going to be a brand that&#8217;s in people&#8217;s lives on a daily basis and that’s as well known but more badass and more iconic than Nike. Our presence in people’s lives is going to be positively influential and nourishing. The content that we&#8217;re going to produce, the things that we&#8217;re going to promote, it&#8217;s going to have a clear, distinct, unique identity that is really hard to copy, and I feel like people are going to try and copy it, or copy aspects of it, and they&#8217;re just not going to nail it, or they&#8217;re not going to do it right. People are going to know when it&#8217;s by Spitfire and when it&#8217;s by someone trying to be like Spitfire. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investors will ask stuff like, &#8220;How are you going to beat Nike?&#8221; It’s funny because Nike, they&#8217;re trying to appeal to as many people as possible. But we’re speaking to one very specific thing &#8211; that inner voice in every woman that makes her feel like, “I’m a badass and I can do anything I put my mind to.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are not going to be one of those &#8216;grow as fast as possible&#8217; companies, but one that has a very clear sense of what it stands for and that forges ahead on its own and at it&#8217;s own pace.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People at Nike don’t wake up every morning and think about how they’re going to achieve that. They’re in the business of clothes, shoes, and wearables. But we are going to get better and better at speaking so soulfully to women’s deep inner selves, we’re going to be a distinct persona in people’s heads and women are going to want to have a daily dose of spitfire in their lives. That is where I want to get. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, I also want to be a really competitive national Olympic weightlifter. I see myself doing weight-lifting for a long time. There are some internationally competitive women in weightlifting who are in their forties right now and they&#8217;re doing amazing &#8211; and I want to be just like them. They are so happy. They are so fulfilled and kicking ass! I want to lift heavy shit. It&#8217;s funny, when weight lifting gets hard I ask myself, &#8220;Why, why do I do this?!&#8221; Well, </span>one day I decided I was tired of being weak. And unlike many, I decided I was going to do something about it. And that’s why I’m here now.</p>\n<p><b>What advice would for others wanting to build a product of their own?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When people ask me how to learn how to code, they often ask questions like &#8211; What programming language should I learn? Or what book should I read? Instead of suddenly picking a programming language I usually ask, is there something cool that you personally want to see in the world that you would love to make? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then I say, &#8220;Okay, take that, and make it really, really, really crystal clear, and then scope it down to the most basic thing you can think of, and then learn how to code that.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because when you learn how to code the other way—by learning a language—you just end up reading a bunch of stuff that you don&#8217;t know how to apply. But when you have a very specific vision for what you want to build, you end up deciding what you need to know to build the thing, and you just break down the pieces. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;One day I decided I was tired of being weak.

So I was born in the Dominican Republic. Me, my mom, and my sister—well my mom and my dad were never married at any point, so technically I&#8217;m a bastard child if that’s how you would like to call it.</span></p>\n<p><b>It&#8217;s the same in Norway. Most of my family isn’t married in Norway and that’s normal. They all just make babies together.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[chuckles] Then my mom took me and my sister to New York at a very early age, at like five years. This is hard because I hardly ever talk about my mom because we&#8217;ve had a very rough history. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mom was a single mother. She came to a new country, didn&#8217;t know the language at all, took on some small jobs here and there as a housekeeper—when I was very young—in New York. I was like five or six. I don&#8217;t even remember any of this really. It&#8217;s all stories that I&#8217;ve been told.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It was a hard time for me when I was really young. We were poor and we all slept in one bed in New York City.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During that time, she also got into the system. She applied for and received welfare, and then once I got a little older, I started seeing how my mom started to change. This is a touchy subject because I don&#8217;t really talk too much about this because it is kind of a dark period of mine—but my mom kind of got really unmotivated, stopped working, starting taking out a lot of student loans and doing college classes, even though it seemed like she wasn&#8217;t really into the profession and was just using it as a means of getting free money and really not spending too much time at home. </span></p>\n<p>It was a hard time for me when I was really young. We were poor and we all slept in one bed in New York City.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It was in the Upper East Side, and at that time that area wasn&#8217;t the Upper East Side that it is today I guess. It was higher up in the hundreds, so it was almost borderline East Harlem. So I was your typical poor kid in public school system growing up in New York</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My dad, who I&#8217;ve been in contact with here and there, was actually—he&#8217;s a very smart businessman. His business started expanding and getting very big. At one point he came back to me right before I started junior high school, and saw how I was developing and wasn&#8217;t very happy. I would say I was a little bit of a rebel. I was staying out all the time. I was kind of like the independent, young New Yorker that most New York kids are really [chuckles]. Super independent, living our own lifestyles, doing whatever we wanted. He wasn&#8217;t very happy so he asked me if I wanted to come back with him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At that time that was a really hard decision. I didn&#8217;t want to leave my mom. I knew that she was having trouble and I wanted to help her out, but I couldn&#8217;t really. It&#8217;s just hard for a young New York kid. I was maybe 14 or 15, I don&#8217;t remember exactly how old I was at the time when I moved to the Dominican Republic with my dad and went to junior high school and high school there. It&#8217;s funny because I look back at it and it&#8217;s probably the best decision I ever made. My dad was doing very well. I was able to live a different lifestyle that I&#8217;ve never lived before. It was much better than what I had in New York, surprisingly. It was also like the Dominican Republic In general, is a very family oriented country. A lot of the families stay together and they&#8217;re very close, so I got to meet my family, and be very close to them at all times. People that I&#8217;m so happy that I&#8217;ve gotten much closer with by moving back home. Since it was just me, my mom, and my sister.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I&#8217;m going to take a step back, cause there&#8217;s actually a lot of stuff that I left out. [laughter]</span></p>\n<p><b>Let&#8217;s go back. Let&#8217;s dig in.</b></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s go back a little. [chuckles] This is going to be a little weird. So when I was in New York, my mom (for a short while) worked for a couple of people that I hold very dearly to my life, and have helped me get to where I am right now. This couple hired my mom to be a housekeeper for them, and then they met me and my sister and took us under their wing. Almost as their own, but we never actually lived with them. But they were mentors to my sister and I when we were very young. The reason I never steered too far to the point of no return, was because of them. They were able to help guide and provide for us, which was something that we didn&#8217;t have when we were young so we&#8217;ve always held them as really close family members.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When my dad came to ask me to move back to the Dominican Republic is was a hard decision. It was one of those decisions where you&#8217;re like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to leave this new family I have here, this small family that I just started making my own.&#8221; Then there was my mom who was having a lot of problems, so it was a really hard decision. I just took it and just went with it, but then again, I look back and I have no regrets. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the Dominican Republic, it&#8217;s totally different. The lifestyle there is much more laid back. It&#8217;s not as hectic, and there isn’t so much childhood pressure that you would get in New York City. There were things that interested me that I could actually focus on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was a very creative person from a very young age and I was able to take the time and develop certain skills that I probably couldn&#8217;t have developed if I stayed in New York. Really, it was funny that a country like the Dominican Republic, where design isn’t as important, would help nurture me. I don&#8217;t know if important is the right word, but it is something that&#8217;s not always the forefront of a small country. I think countries like the Dominican Republic and smaller countries are very focused on creating businesses and things like that, and design is not really part of that equation —at least not yet.  </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Really, a lot the stuff that I learned was on my own. I just sat there. I played around with things. I spent a lot of days sitting in my room designing a little bit, (or at least what I thought was designing). I don&#8217;t know. If I look back on it, it&#8217;s probably crap now [chuckles], but it&#8217;s still good stuff.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At that time, I saw an opportunity to help out with small marketing projects. I made some promotional flyers for nightclubs and stuff like that because they were like marketers basically and marketers needed creativity. Without creativity they can&#8217;t do their marketing. That&#8217;s where I got my start. I was 15, 16 years old and finally getting my hands on a computer with Photoshop and learning things like CorelDRAW, Photoshop Illustrator, Swift, Flash and all kinds of programs. Once I got my hands on those tools I started to expand from paper and just started playing around with new things. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In between that, the distractions were really around and I thought to myself should I be doing this? I think my dad did the right thing by never really talking to me about what direction I should go in because if that were the case, I probably wouldn’t have stuck with design. I think it was just a part of everyone&#8217;s mind that design just doesn&#8217;t equal success or an opportunity to be successful, but I was able to continue with that.</span> Really, a lot the stuff that I learned was on my own. I just sat there. I played around with things. I spent a lot of days sitting in my room designing a little bit, (or at least what I thought was designing). I don&#8217;t know. If I look back on it, it&#8217;s probably crap now [chuckles], but it&#8217;s still good stuff.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly, I think what really boosted me was in part what my dad did for me. He asked me to create branding for a new company that he was starting as a pharmacy chain—expanding the pharmacies that he already had—and I was able to create the branding for them. That&#8217;s where I saw the opportunity of getting into a professional field of design. So once I did that branding—I Googled what branding was and I was studying stuff like IBM and all these guys, just looking at what they were doing with the bold colors and textures and stuff like that. If you look at that pharmacy logo it&#8217;s very much inspired by that era [chuckles]. From there, it actually went off really well. I was able to learn a few things, how to work with print shops to get the logo right and do small things like that. That opportunity was huge for me. I think that really changed my direction of where I wanted to be headed.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Anything I was able to get my hands on, I learned it by myself, and probably in the best way possible by grinding through it and doing extra class projects that weren’t mandatory.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, the internet was really intriguing for me. It was really slow, [chuckles] it was painful in the Dominican Republic. We didn&#8217;t really have good internet there for a very long time until recently. I was super interested in web design, but I knew that my interest in particular was graphic design. That&#8217;s kind of what it was classified as. Just graphic design. At that time a lot of the schools that I was looking into when I was younger—during high school and after high school—they were all just advertising graphic design. I didn&#8217;t really know there was a web space or a product space. I think my abilities to see something and kind of shift to it what I thought was important—something that I knew was going to be big or huge at the time—is what also helped me a little bit. Taking matters into my own hands and learning things that I want to learn and doing things that I want to do, as stubborn as that sounds, is something that just helped. I never really spoke to my parents about my professional career, what I wanted my professional career to be, and that&#8217;s also helped, and they just let me do it. I went to school and did whatever I could do to get by.</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m curious, I grew up in a very small town in North Carolina, and I don&#8217;t even think I heard the word “creative” until I was maybe sixteen. Where did you first get bit with the creative bug? Where were you when you were introduced to design as a concept?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was in Manhattan actually. When I was really young, I took art classes in public school in P.S. 75 in New York. At that time, all my teachers really loved that I was super creative. They would push for me to continue being that way, and I remember right before I graduated junior high school, one of my teachers was pushing me to try and go to La Guardia high school, which is a design art school in New York city. So, I kind of had the knowledge that, &#8220;Hey, there is a design art field out there.&#8221; And really it just stuck with me. This is what I want to do, I&#8217;m really happy, and people enjoy my work. So at a very early age, I think living in New York just opened me up to that idea. And then after moving back there for college, I got to concentrate and just focus on it because there were very little distractions for me.</span></p>\n<p><b>So walk me through the path from designing logos in your hometown to being in the middle of Silicon Valley.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So that was a little interesting. There&#8217;s going to be a little bashing in here. So when I was looking for colleges in New York—since I was technically a citizen at that time—I was able to look at U.S. colleges and I told my dad that I wanted to go to college and I&#8217;ll pay for it if I have to do it. But I want to do it in the U.S. because it&#8217;s design, right? In the Dominican Republic none of the universities taught design or had a big design field. There was one that partnered with Parsons but then still, I&#8217;d have to go to Parsons to be able to do a Dominican Republic kind of thing? So I decided to just bite the bullet and go. One school that accepted me and gave me somewhat of a scholarship was New York Institute of Technology. They&#8217;re a technology school in New York and had a graphic design program. And I was like, I&#8217;ll give it a shot and see how it goes.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It was 2008, there was the peak of the recession. And it was so hard to find work, I think I probably interviewed like 20, 30 times with a range of people.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once I started there, it was kind of immediate to me that they didn&#8217;t seem to really specialize in the graphic design field—it was very much a traditional design kind of curriculum. But at the same time, I was starting to get into web design, and just the web in general. So there&#8217;s a few things that I did in college that leaned towards web design. I was already really proficient with different programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and Design. </span>Anything I was able to get my hands on, I learned it by myself, and probably in the best way possible by grinding through it and doing extra class projects that weren’t mandatory. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;d even say that I was way ahead of the school curriculum, because they were trying to teach us those tools that I already excelled in. So during that time, I guess I just decided to learn HTML/CSS for one, which is probably the best thing I did in college—opening up code books and starting to learn it. In fact, that helped land me my first job and I&#8217;ll get to that later. Learning HTML/CSS during school was challenging because it&#8217;s not a school that was—it was very traditional, we were just drawing type on paper and learning lettering, whatever traditional graphic designers learn. But I love tech. I love anything that has to do with tech. I was into computers a lot so I got enough to afford a nice system that I just started to work on. And then I began to learn how to code, little by little, starting by building basic webpages and learning a little bit of Flash—something that I&#8217;m actually really happy that I dropped after a while because eventually it didn&#8217;t end up being that big, luckily. At that time people were like, &#8220;Flash this, Flash that, do Flash!&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;ehh, no, no. I&#8217;ll learn how to build a webpage first and see how that goes.&#8221; And luckily I did that because soon after, Flash just died down really quickly.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yep.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I went through four years of college, four years of drawing and design and all that. It&#8217;s stuff that I enjoy doing, but I knew that in order for me to do what I like to do, which is like building things, and just being a part of a team, and doing stuff like that, web was like the place to be. I did some freelancing graphic design, and I wasn&#8217;t too happy with it. I freelanced for Scholastic Books for a while, and at that point, I just felt like it wasn&#8217;t challenging enough. It was a lot of small effortless jobs, doing a lot of designs that had already been done. There was not much room there to innovate and really excite me. But, when I looked at the web, it was the opposite. There was a lot there that wasn&#8217;t boring and I feel like at that time, I was reading articles about places like Facebook, and Google for instance, that were really interesting into how they built things, and how things were so new and fresh and exciting. So, once I graduated, I started looking at web agencies, like Huge Inc., and places—and small startups here and there, in Comcast. You know, things that were a little bit more in a digital range, to see if I could get my foot in the door and started learning more. Luckily, one of the startups, which was Livestream, allowed me to come in at the time. Mind you, at this time, it was really, really difficult to find work. </span>It was 2008, there was the peak of the recession, [laughter] whatever the recession was. And it was so hard to find work, I think I probably interviewed like 20, 30 times with a range of people.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When I interviewed at Livestream, they were just looking for a junior web designer, and one of the requirements was to hopefully know how to code. I actually had some prior knowledge of coding but I wasn&#8217;t great. And then I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ll take it.&#8221; It&#8217;s my first job and the only one that really gave me a concrete offer and I was just like, &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221; [laughter] And that was my door into product design, and then that was my path. It was awesome at that point.</span></p>\n<p><b>Were you still in New York at this point, or in Silicon Valley?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, no, no, this is in New York. So, I went back to New York for college and I stayed there. Livestream is still located in New York and hired me after I graduated from college. Like, three or four months after college. Three or four months of excruciating job searching [laughter]. Yeah. It was also kind of difficult because my degree was for graphic design, so to prove that I can do web I had to build my own portfolio online. This isn’t something I would recommend anyone doing anymore because this is a new age, but I did some redesigns of websites that I thought needed the redesign and small things like that, but nowadays it&#8217;s not a great thing to do [laughter] so I would never recommend it. But at the time, anything was good to show and it was still kind of early, so why not.</span></p>\n<p><b>What were those first years of work like for you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hard. I think I learned more in one year at Livestream than four years in college. It was extremely difficult. I had to really build my coding skills a lot, to the point where I was like a beginner and now I&#8217;m more than like—I&#8217;m pretty good [laughter]. And it was because of the fast paced work at Livestream. We had clients that required strict deadlines at the time, and I was doing a lot of custom development for some clients, so I had to build these Facebook apps. At that time, Facebook had page apps so I was doing a lot of that stuff, so designing them and then building them, and sometimes I had to build three or four apps a day.</span></p>\n<p><b>Wow.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It got insane, yeah. It was really a lot of work. And then throughout that time I got to learn a lot about iconography and building UI and all that stuff. I was able to design one of their first iPhone apps and one of their first iPad apps at the time. That was all extremely exciting for me because the iPhone and similar gadgets were on the rise. I&#8217;d say I&#8217;d learned so much during that time. I was at LiveStream for four years, and those years were all difficult.</span></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s a whole lifetime in startup years.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, I guess I got a little, I don&#8217;t know. Yeah, I don&#8217;t know. It was interesting. It was a lot of exciting work. I was learning a lot, so it kept me very busy and entertained. I guess I didn&#8217;t see myself needing to go anywhere. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started at a very, very low salary. This is like a common story for a lot of people I bet. Especially women and minorities in general. Towards the tail end I started noticing a few patterns—I had to go through tough salary negotiations where I could get a livable wage. Even then I didn&#8217;t really feel like they wanted to take care of me, so eventually I just left.</span></p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m happiest when I&#8217;m given the biggest challenges. It&#8217;s just like, &#8216;Look. We have something that we don&#8217;t know how to do. Can you help us out?&#8217; And I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Yeah, let&#8217;s build a house [laughter]. Why not?&#8217; I&#8217;m that person. You give me some crazy task and I&#8217;ll probably give it a try and see where I get to. It may not be perfect. I&#8217;ll probably warn you and be like, &#8216;Look. If it fucks up, I&#8217;m sorry [laughter].&#8217; But I&#8217;ll give it a try. I&#8217;m not really scared of challenges and that&#8217;s helped my career out a lot I think.'&#8221;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was really difficult at that time. A company came up to me—well actually a recruiter came up to me with an opportunity to kind of lead design at a small company, and I took it. This was just another step of a lot of learning. The company was called NewsCred. They&#8217;re still around and also in New York. I interviewed with them, and met their CEO and immediately we clicked. I was able to help lead their product design for their company. It was new to me, because I&#8217;d never led a team. Not anywhere remotely to that so again I had to quickly learn how to build a product from scratch, basically on my own from a design perspective, to actually being the UI engineer as well because we were really short staffed. So there was nobody to do the front end work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So in like a year we built a product, a huge product for marketers that was like huge for them. And it was a huge win for me career wise, and that&#8217;s where I got, I guess that&#8217;s where, I still don&#8217;t know how Facebook found me, but that&#8217;s eventually how I came to Facebook a year later [chuckles]. Yeah, so it&#8217;s kind of a long road. There&#8217;s a lot of things in between.</span></p>\n<p><b>I can relate. When I worked in start ups of like you&#8217;re just taxed with doing things you&#8217;ve never done before and you do whatever it takes to learn to learn them and do them. I&#8217;m just curious—when you encountered that atmosphere on day one of your first job, did you automatically feel like, ”Okay yeah, cool. I&#8217;m going to learn that shit and I&#8217;m just going to do it,” or were you just terrified? Did you have to go through any sort of personal process to convince yourself that you could do this stuff or did you just resolve to go do it?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. I can do it, I&#8217;ve got to go learn it. I think that&#8217;s me. I think the last one&#8217;s me. </span></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m happiest when I&#8217;m given the biggest challenges. It&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Look. We have something that we don&#8217;t know how to do. Can you help us out?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, let&#8217;s build a house [laughter]. Why not?&#8221; I&#8217;m that person. You give me some crazy task and I&#8217;ll probably give it a try and see where I get to. It may not be perfect. I&#8217;ll probably warn you and be like, &#8220;Look. If it fucks up, I&#8217;m sorry [laughter].&#8221; But I&#8217;ll give it a try. I&#8217;m not really scared of challenges and that&#8217;s helped my career out a lot I think.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think being a little brave and a little naive has helped a lot. Even with NewsCred, they knew that I never led a team before, but then they gave me a big task and knew that I could run with it and build something. In the few months that I started there, they had an idea of what they wanted. I was able to provide some kind of vision and just keep going with that and that kind of momentum it sticks to you early on in the production process. Once you&#8217;re able to at least come up with a defined vision and idea, it&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;ll stick. Let&#8217;s try and execute.&#8221;</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think if you get scared about doing any minimal task, then it&#8217;s going to be harder for you down the road, because problems usually just get bigger.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like I&#8217;m the perfect person to be on product because it&#8217;s like I have enough experience now and enough know-how—I&#8217;ve made so many mistakes throughout the years—just kind of a better idea of where things should head in general. I was able to use that knowledge that I&#8217;ve built up from Livestream, all the mistakes that I&#8217;ve made and just like—let&#8217;s start over, let&#8217;s try something new and see how that process works. Maybe I&#8217;ve just been really lucky.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Anyway, it&#8217;s—yeah, I think that&#8217;s what works for me. I think it&#8217;s just—the bigger the challenge, the more excited I am and that&#8217;s a good thing for product designers. </span><em> </em>I think if you get scared about doing any minimal task, then it&#8217;s going to be harder for you down the road, because problems usually just get bigger.</p>\n<p><b>Totally. What is the most exciting thing to you about working in Silicon Valley right now, like building tools that are used by a billion people around the world? What do you love about your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I build tools for advertisers, so I&#8217;m on the advertising side of Facebook. And these are tools specialized for agency advertisers. This field excites me a ton. I think what we call business design is something that&#8217;s usually overlooked by a lot of designers. I think a lot of designers, like the more higher-visibility work and the nicer mobile apps and stuff like that. But I get more interested in complex challenges and complex problems. And being in business design at Facebook actually makes me super happy, because it&#8217;s a field that&#8217;s still kind of relatively new again, and this is something that I learned at NewsCred as well. NewsCred was also kind of like a B-to-B, it wasn&#8217;t like a B-to-C. And doing that I actually learned that, &#8220;Hey, this is actually a pretty cool field.&#8221; You can do some great things. What we&#8217;re trying to do at Facebook is humanize our products, and make those products easier for everyday use for advertisers. It&#8217;s a great challenge. Working for Facebook, at this scale—even at the scale of advertisers that we&#8217;re working for—is pretty insane. There&#8217;s a lot of pressure, but at the same time there is a lot of, how do you say that—gratitude?—for the work I&#8217;m doing. Is that right? I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the right word.</span></p>\n<p><b>Value.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, it&#8217;s super fulfilling. Honestly, Facebook is an awesome place to work at, just in general.</span> I feel super grateful working here. It&#8217;s kind of like you&#8217;ve made it, in a way, especially for somebody like me that&#8217;s just been all over the place—just jumping left and right, crawling my way up. Then you&#8217;ve reached the top, and you&#8217;re just like, &#8220;Woah. This is a different world here. It works differently.&#8221;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I&#8217;ve been extremely lucky. Just the path that I&#8217;ve taken and coming here to Silicon Valley—it&#8217;s great. I&#8217;m working with like-minded individuals—super smart individuals—and get to work with great designers that I look up to everyday—people that inspire me everyday. We just build off of this huge momentum and keep working on these great products all the time.</span></p>\n<p><b>I love how the work that you&#8217;re doing ties back to the original work that interested you in the first place—designing for businesses as a kid.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, it&#8217;s great. I&#8217;m at a perfect place now. I&#8217;m an illustrator as well, so at times I miss doing consumer work in a way. I do miss that side of it a little bit but at the same time I&#8217;m super happy where I&#8217;m at. I come to work smiling every day. I&#8217;m one of the happiest people that comes in. Just knowing where I&#8217;m at now and just working with the people I work with, I&#8217;m super happy where I&#8217;m at.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I feel super grateful working here. It&#8217;s kind of like you&#8217;ve made it, in a way, especially for somebody like me that&#8217;s just been all over the place—just jumping left and right, crawling my way up. Then you&#8217;ve reached the top, and you&#8217;re just like, &#8216;Woah. This is a different world here. It works differently.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>What were your first impressions of Silicon Valley when you got here?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was scared. I had no idea what to expect. One, I was one of those kids that just like loves small companies; loves small families. I used to bring the culture as much as possible to every small company. I&#8217;m the one that organized the karaoke events; the beer Fridays. I loved having that culture and building those things and working with people that just like to have fun while they&#8217;re working. So I was actually really scared. I read a lot of articles at the time that were like, &#8220;Oh, big company culture. Cubicles,&#8221; this and that. And then I was reading a lot about Facebook who tried to break down those barriers a little bit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So that interested me a little bit. I was like, &#8220;OK, this is open, weird culture.&#8221; Still, what&#8217;s the top-down level? I&#8217;ve always had to deal with some kind of hierarchy that made my work a lot harder and at times—I was still scared. There&#8217;s so many people, and so many hurdles. Will I still have the control that I enjoy in my work, and would I still be able to influence and provide any kind of impact to the work that I&#8217;m doing? How many people am I working with? Am I just going to be editing buttons, and text inputs, and stuff for weeks? That would put me to sleep.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I came and interviewed, and even after the interview I was a little skeptical. I knew that the place was awesome. I was like, &#8220;Wow. This place is cool. This is like Disneyland for adults. It&#8217;s crazy.&#8221; Then I thought &#8220;How many other opportunities will there be for me to work at Facebook?&#8221; Why not give it a try? It was a company that I&#8217;ve always looked up to, and the design, and product work that they&#8217;ve been doing. Their mission is something that I have always—who can&#8217;t agree with their mission? It&#8217;s amazing, right? So I ended up biting the bullet and doing it. I don&#8217;t think it was a bad decision at all. I think it was actually a great decision. It&#8217;s worked out really well so far. </span></p>\n<p><b>Awesome. What do you think are your biggest motivators or influences?</b></p>\n<p>The more I talk to designers here, I always feel like they have specific examples of what these things are. I am going to be one of the few people that will tell you that it&#8217;s hard to say what it is. The challenge of the problems motivate me more than just specific people or influencers. I don&#8217;t have any influencers that are really big. I&#8217;ve always tried not to get too influenced by people, because then I feel like my work will depict that exact thing. It can be very easy to fall into that, but it is a good question, and I&#8217;ve never really thought of it that way. The people that influence me all the time are my coworkers. My immediate coworkers. The people who along with myself, solve these problems together. Also, just the problems, themselves, and who we&#8217;re solving these problems for.</p>\n<p><b>How do you think your background and life experiences impact the way that you approach your work? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The way my life has been, it&#8217;s kind of been all over the place. It shows that I&#8217;m not afraid to try new things. And that is exactly how it impacts my work. I&#8217;ve always been able to try and challenge my limits and try something new and push outside of my comfort zone, right? And that&#8217;s really defined a lot of my work. I&#8217;ve been able to do a lot of things with that like at Newscred and be able to build a new product that looked nothing like anything out there for the field because I can keep pushing and looking away from competition and trying that. I think that&#8217;s how my life has really benefitted my work, it&#8217;s just like don&#8217;t be afraid. Try it, do it and see what happens.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, for sure.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even with Facebook I&#8217;ve been able to do that. Which sounds weird but, yeah, I can.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do your family and friends from home feel about how far you&#8217;ve come and all the work that you&#8217;ve done?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know, they don&#8217;t say much. [laughter] I think though, honestly—I know they&#8217;re very proud of me. My dad is super successful. My whole family is a huge success I think, and I&#8217;m really proud of them and they&#8217;re excellent people—amazing people. And having their support all the time has been—it keeps me going, makes me super happy. And my wife now too, she&#8217;s super supportive, she&#8217;s one of the best people—the best person I can be with right now and makes me super happy. We&#8217;ve been together for like eight years so she&#8217;s been through a lot of this stuff that I&#8217;ve been going through. And I guess back home, my family, they&#8217;re just very super happy, like always positive people. That&#8217;s kind of how I am and when I go home I&#8217;m just part of the family, I&#8217;m not any different really. And I love it that way, that&#8217;s how I want it to be.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in five or ten years, do you think you&#8217;ll still be here?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh shit, that&#8217;s a good question.  You know, to be honest with you, I&#8217;ve always had a dream of finally owning what I&#8217;m building at one point. I&#8217;ve built so many great things for so many different companies and people and users, and I still want to build for users and people all the time. But I do want to eventually maybe do my own thing, like have my own creative business or boutique or whatever. And I&#8217;m really still kind of open to that idea, I&#8217;m hoping it just lands on my lap somehow, which it probably won&#8217;t, so I don&#8217;t know. We&#8217;ll see.</span></p>\n<p><b>Well, I mean the cool thing about your work experience—having just done so much different stuff—you&#8217;re the kind of person who&#8217;s perfectly equipped to start your own thing later, you know?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you for that. That&#8217;s a nice thing, I&#8217;ve never heard somebody say that.</span></p>\n<p><b>Having done it myself, I&#8217;m so glad I worked in tech doing a million different things. And now I&#8217;m a photographer, but all of that stuff I did before is such a huge reason I&#8217;m successful. It&#8217;s so good to learn all those random things. It doesn&#8217;t make sense immediately, but it does later.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How&#8217;s that been for you? This is kind of like your own thing, right? I mean it&#8217;s super impressive.</span></p>\n<p><b>Just a side project—that&#8217;s gotten really big.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love your work by the way.</span></p>\n<p><b>Thanks. Yeah, I mean it&#8217;s the best decision I ever made. You know, I still get to tangentially pop in and out of tech, and be involved however I want, but I work for myself, and I have complete control over who I work with, and I make way more money, and everything is better.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, that&#8217;s so cool. Yeah, it&#8217;s one of things like, you know, people have never had their doors open for them. It&#8217;s like I feel like I can do it, right, I&#8217;ll just work through it and find something great and do whatever I can. That&#8217;s a nice thing to have I think. I feel like my career, even though it&#8217;s been like painful a lot of times, is like, &#8220;Hey, I got here mainly on my own, just as much as possible, just working hard, and doing what I love.&#8221; So the creative field&#8217;s great. I love the field, it&#8217;s awesome. [chuckles]</span></p>\n<p><b>Okay, last question, this is important. What advice would you give to folks from similar backgrounds to you, who want to get into tech? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, it&#8217;s an easy and hard question, because I feel like the advice I would give them would be very similar to what I did, right? But at the same time, I feel like the field itself has transformed to a lot of the young designers have learned things that at one point, I was the one learning it on my own, and these guys are learning it from school or on their own as well. I feel like the hacker mentality of building things and doing things that are unknown, is so much more natural these days than it was eight or nine years ago. It&#8217;s interesting because my advice to them—to the young adults coming out of college [chuckles] with a lot of knowledge in the tech industry and products and being surrounded by products is </span>just take it all in and try and build things at all times. Build the smallest things to the biggest things. Just try and build stuff really. We&#8217;re all builders and even if it&#8217;s just a coffee table or any small thing, it&#8217;s important. It&#8217;s something that you&#8217;ll learn from. I would even say start small. If you want to start big, go ahead [chuckles]. There&#8217;s no real wrong path as long as you&#8217;re building and working.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It&#8217;s funny because like five years ago, I would&#8217;ve been able to give you a better answer, but now days, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;These guys are doing pretty good.&#8221; I&#8217;ve seen a lot of these young university students graduating, and I&#8217;m super impressed by their work. </span></p>\n<p><b>What about any thoughts for the Dominican Republic, your homeland?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the Dominican Republic, I want them to take design more seriously because a lot of it is still thought to be extremely superficial, but design can do a lot of things to better a country in general—there&#8217;s a lot of possibility there. It&#8217;s not just graphic design anymore. In order to do that there needs to be work done around access to the internet. I know the internet is still extremely expensive and inaccessible for most of the country, but there&#8217;s so many things that you can do online right now that can help grow and nurture existing and new businesses while opening doors for engineering and design.</span></p>\n<p>I hope it gets to the point where we can just have a lot of people like me just move there and work. One day, hopefully that&#8217;s the case.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Just take it all in and try and build things at all times. Build the smallest things to the biggest things. Just try and build stuff really. We&#8217;re all builders and even if it&#8217;s just a coffee table or any small thing, it&#8217;s important. It&#8217;s something that you&#8217;ll learn from.

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was formed in a culture clash. I’m first generation Eurasian—Czech, Filipina, Taiwanese—and was raised in a small hippie town founded by an Indian guru in Iowa. Fitting in was never a possibility; I spent my childhood hoping to be noticed for something else other than being different. </span></p>\n<p><b>What was family life like? What did your family expect of you career-wise? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was thirteen my father took a trip to the east coast and brought me back a Harvard t-shirt. As the eldest of four, I bore the brunt of his immigrant dreams. Thankfully he was more of a “follow your passion” type guy than one who pushed for law or medicine. </span></p>\n<p>My biological mother hails from a rural village in the Philippines and was the first in her family to finish high school and go to college. When she obtained a PhD and position at MIT, she cemented a place in the provincial hall of fame. I don’t know much else about who she is unfortunately. She died in a car accident when I was young, but even her ghost is hard to live up to.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Fitting in was never a possibility; I spent my childhood hoping to be noticed for something else other than being different.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My father is a kooky but brilliant underachiever, a renaissance man who possesses that rare blend of a critical mind and creative talents which he channels into architecture, art, philosophy, and poetry, and deftly speaks at least five languages. He has an anti-authority streak, refusing to work for anyone else and only at his own whim. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His lack of material success is an endless source of frustration for him, and seems to only be redeemable by his children&#8217;s. He taught us to read as toddlers and multiplication in kindergarten, and hoped that this would set us on a trajectory for life. My (half) siblings are in their twenties and are wonderful people with musical abilities, artistic talents, keen minds, and sensitive hearts. So maybe he was right. </span></p>\n<p>I can’t imagine my potential career ever entered my stepmother’s mind; she didn’t care for me much as I was a reminder of the woman before her. As for my father, what I did or was didn’t seem to matter to him as long as I made him look good.</p>\n<p><b>What did you think you were going to be when you grew up?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was a child I had no sense of future; I just wanted to read and climb trees. As a teenager I lived to travel and got any and all odd jobs to make it happen. The world was a wondrous place of beautiful landscapes and art with fascinating history, and full of unique people. When my grandmother described the life of an ambassador, I set my heart on it, and actually chose Tufts for their International Relations program. Politics lost its allure quickly though, and I ended up majoring in Anthropology. </span></p>\n<p><b>How do you think your background and life experiences impact the way you approach your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the first decade and change of my career, I helped foster communities around tech products, namely Yelp and Airbnb. I&#8217;d have to credit my childhood experience as part of a meditation community in Iowa as being the most enlightening case study on how to create a movement. I experienced first hand what motivates and inspires people to give their time, resources, and hearts to a cause; How hierarchy and different power structures influences people’s drive and sense of ownership; The ways that norms are reinforced and what happens when people act out; What to do when the message gets out of hand. Life lessons for me. </span></p>\n<p><b>How did you first get interested in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m compelled by how tech allows people to live more enriching, fulfilling lives. The idea of “tech” didn’t initially interest me. I used Napster, ICQ, and ebay in college, but never gave much thought to actually working in the sector. In fact, had you asked me then I was totally ignorant of the fact that from the ashes dot com bust interesting companies were emerging. But I’ve never been someone who’s motivated by contributing to cutting-edge technical developments. I often wish I had a more visionary bent.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;W<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">e landed in SF with a cell phone, $300 bucks, and a backpack full of sarongs. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every day for the first two weeks we set up shop selling sarongs on Haight Street and trolling Craigslist for opps. I went through a series of odd jobs: pyramid schemes selling office supplies, handling boa constrictors, trimming weed, data entry.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><b>How’d you end up in SF and in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2004 after college I sold all my worldly possessions and moved to Bali, Indonesia. It was first put on the map by my midwife “auntie” who opens birthing centers in developing countries. After a few months traipsing around the island and bumming around on the beach with my then-boyfriend, we ran out of money. I had no interest in going back to Boston, so when he suggested we go to SF because of the great house scene (we both fancied ourselves aspiring DJs) I agreed despite having never been to the city. I knew one person from my hometown living there and she offered up her couch to us as a temporary crash pad. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So we landed in SF with a cell phone, $300 bucks, and a backpack full of sarongs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every day for the first two weeks we set up shop selling sarongs on Haight Street and trolling Craigslist for opps. I went through a series of odd jobs: pyramid schemes selling office supplies, handling boa constrictors, trimming weed, data entry. Until I landed a temp job at a commercial property insurance company. I was so happy to have regular income, it took me a year to realize that the agency had been taking an unfair cut. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I ended up in tech by sweet serendipity. First, I randomly saw Yelp paraphernalia on the bus and later found out that I shared a route with the graphic designer. Then I got a Daily Candy newsletter sponsored by Yelp. Being new to the city, I was curious about places to go and badly needed friends. So when I visited the site and saw several hundred people yapping about things to see and eat, I got hooked. I discovered some great places through the site and shared my reviews in return. The marketing director, Nish Nadaraja, took notice and invited me to one of the first Yelp events ever, at a place restaurant called Oola on Folsom.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;For weeks after, I emailed any and all contacts at Yelp in hopes of getting a job. They were like, &#8216;Can you code? No? Sorry, we’ve got nothing for you.&#8217; But a few months after, they posted for an Office / HR Manager and I jumped on it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wasn’t quite sure what to expect, so I put on my best tweed blazer and flared jeans (gah!) and dragged my then-boyfriend along to the party. I had prepared myself for an awkward experience, but when I saw Jane Kwett, a face I recognized from the site at the door I was put at ease. Entering the party and plied with a cocktail, I was thrilled to meet all the characters I’d be interacting with online in 3D. Everyone was welcoming, clever, and slightly nerdy, and I immediately felt like I wanted to be part of their tribe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That night, I met the CEO Jeremy and much of the eight person team. For weeks after, I emailed any and all contacts at Yelp in hopes of getting a job. They were like, “Can you code? No? Sorry, we’ve got nothing for you.” But a few months after, they posted for an Office / HR Manager and I jumped on it. </span></p>\n<p><b>What were your first impressions of Silicon Valley?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The early 2000s stereotypes were true: the scene I was privy to was mostly enginerds in hoodies who wore a rotating collection of startup t-shirts. When I started working at Yelp, we were sharing office space with a few other companies that were birthed from MRL Ventures, the incubator started by Max Levchin (Paypal co-founder). I didn’t know anyone else working at startups in the city. Most people I met in technology were at the old giants—eBay, Salesforce, Cisco—in the South Bay and a handful were at Google and a rising star called Facebook. </span></p>\n<p><b>Walk me through your experience working in tech. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2004 at 22 years old, I started off as an admin at Yelp when the company was nine people. After a year or so, when the company set its sights on expansion, I joined the marketing department. We had a market-by-market strategy which involved a person on the ground leading the efforts. So off I went to Boston to launch our third city. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Essentially it was my job to introduce new people to the product and made sure they continued to participate. Tactically, this combined a heady mix of online engagement, offline events, local PR, content, and partnerships. Internally we were referred to as the “Mayors” of the city as we were always out and about. After Boston was up and running I found and trained a successor and moved onto the next market. After tackling a few cities, four years of a 24/7 lifestyle, and experiencing the company explode to over a thousand employees, I was in desperate need of a break. It was whiplash inducing, but awesome. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During a cross-country road trip with my now husband then boyfriend, I read about a site called Airbnb where you could stay at people’s homes instead of a hotel. I loved the concept. When I returned to SF and read that they were part of YC Combinator I figured they might be a company worth working for and figuratively banged down their door until I got an interview. This was 2010.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was slightly disappointed to hear they’d recently moved out of the cofounders home as I looked forward to an intimate team again. But working at a place without a shower probably meant better hours. The position they were hiring for was content and as a weekly newsletter was part of our Yelp responsibility, I figured it was something I could tackle. I was also stoked about the introverted nature of the job as I felt socially tapped out. Fourteen interviews later I was offered the position – at a salary I’d been making years prior. Yelp had not yet gone public, so in hindsight this was probably not the wisest decision. But I negotiated a larger equity stake and began clicking away. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 28, I was one of the oldest people at the company. What the team lacked in experience, they made up for in passion, creativity, and scrappy. Everyone was running a million miles an hour—sometimes in different directions—but there was certainly no lack of motivation. It was intoxicating.</span></p>\n<p><b>What was it like building communities from the ground up? Did you have free reign to just build and learn as you went?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marketing starts out a series of experiments of different channels—test and measure, tweak and repeat. As the bulk of my experience has been at early stage startups, there’s little dev and data time to devote to our cause. So initially you’ve gotta run on your assumptions. Nowadays, there’s a plethora of bolt-on products that can track anything under the sun. We weren’t so lucky in my day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately at Yelp, Nish at developed a tried-and-true strategy that we were able to adjust to our local markets, so there was little on the strategy level for us to hash out. We had very clear output metrics and were rewarded with recognition accordingly. So I knew what I needed to do to excel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Airbnb was green field. From the marketing side, they’d dabbled in the basic channels—social, content via blog, and video—as reflected by the team’s talents. But everything was a bit haphazard and as the founders had never managed marketing, we were left mostly to our own devices. Shortly after I joined they brought in a consultant named Julie Supan, formerly VP of Marketing from YouTube, who’d been recommended by investors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Julie gave us much needed structure and our first tangible goal—to articulate the vision and mission of the company. As the content lead, I spent countless hours with her and cofounders in hopes of distilling the company’s raison d&#8217;être, and working in tandem with product, produced the Home and About pages seen by hundreds of millions of people around the globe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a few months, Brian and Joe got pumped about doing more community-oriented efforts and switched me to the task. They were excited about bringing people together offline with the hopes of activating host growth in target markets. How to do this, and to some extent where to activate, was up to me. The traveling began.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I never saw myself paving any path. I’ve always felt more like a pinball ricocheting.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first we mostly operated from hunches. I had few tools to work with, aside from pulling the emails of hosts in certain geographies. Everything was tracked manually: the number of attendees, behavior changes post-event, referrals they brought in. We tested different promotions aiming to get a broader, new audience. Though all we could see were the number of properties in each city and the hits to the blog. As they kept increasing at a faster rate, we assumed we were doing something correctly. We optimized the sequence of different types of events: launch parties, host training sessions, and in-home host celebrations, as markets matured.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t until my second year in, after I had grown the team to dozens of Community Managers in key cities, that the data dudes had the bandwidth to definitively prove our hypotheses: yes, users who attended events became more successful hosts and repeat travelers with higher lifetime values. It was not for naught. </span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you think you got the knack for paving your own path in your career?</b></p>\n<p>It’s interesting you phrase it like that. I never saw myself paving any path. I’ve always felt more like a pinball ricocheting. My decisions have seemed like a series of decisions optimizing for local maximums, more like a moth smelling its way than an arrow flying straight and true. But I’ve been fortunate that my compass has always taken me to good places and that’s reinforcing.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I attribute this to two things: only work for companies with a product I’m crazy about and want to use—case in point, I’m typing this from an Airbnb and I haven’t worked at there in years. And comfort with extreme risk. I can’t tell you how many times people have tried to dissuade me for working where I have, “Let a stranger sleep in your bed? That’s nuts.” or “Do they have any money? You’re going to be out of a job in months.” And the number of raises I’ve forgone for equity?! What can I say? I’m a stubborn believer.</span></p>\n<p><b>What do you look for in a job now vs when you started?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, my sole criterion was all about the product – did I use it, did I love it? Nowadays, it’s not just about product but also about timing. So much changes when a company scales and matures: employee culture, potential impact, compensation, career development and potential, time commitment. In the past I’ve liked the early stages when there’s freedom to be unconventional and potential to lay a strong foundation for growth. But there’s tradeoffs too, lack of stability and work/life balance, lower pay due to low revenue and/or funding, to name a few. I’m finally starting to understand why people I respect have worked at ebay and other corporate giants haha. </span></p>\n<p><b>Overall, what have been the most exciting things about your work? What about your work really activates you? What are you proudest of?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has been immensely gratifying to help shape a nascent product into something that tens millions of people interact with regularly. The sheer scale of potential impact of technology is astounding and addicting. I get most excited when hearing the stories of how people have improved their livelihoods, relationships, and decisions using products I’ve worked on: Business owners on Yelp attracting passion clientele that lets them thrive; Hosts at Airbnb being able to send their kids to better school or using the extra income to pursue a new career. It doesn’t have to be in profound ways either. Little incremental increases still count for me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everything I’m most proud of has a name: they are the people who comprised my team at Airbnb and are the founders of my portfolio companies now. We are made better by the people who give us reign and feedback, and that goes in both directions. I’ve never been a leader by force; if I had a superpower I think it would be that I recognize drive in others and the (potential) skills they possess, and will fight for the resources to make them successful. I hope my people feel the same way.</span></p>\n<p><b>What has your experience been like transitioning into investing?</b></p>\n<p>After Yelp and Airbnb went well, people began coming to me for advice about marketing.  I joined a few companies as an advisor—namely Skillshare and Threadflip—and helped craft their growth strategies. It was a great way to see these companies from the inside, providing valuable diligence. I then joined 500 Startup’s mentor network, offering guidance to their portfolio companies. This gave me increased insight into new sectors and teams, as well as keep a pulse on industry trends.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I didn’t have ample bandwidth to go around, I asked how else I might be of help and was told that investing in these companies would be the next best thing. While of course I understood that this involved a high level of risk, I allowed myself to start investing because I felt like I received more from the startup ecosystem than I deserved and I wanted to give back.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I read various approaches to portfolio theory, and thought it would be wise to invest in things I knew best – female-friendly consumer tech products.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few deals into it, finding that I enjoyed myself and that I was inclined to do more, I thought it would be best to get more educated on the matter. I didn’t know many early operators who were investing at that point. So I signed up for an angel investor crash course with Pipeline Angels. Hungry for deeper info, I flew to New York for another seminar with 37 Angels. Confident around a basic term sheet and having expanded my deal flow to the east cost, things ramped up. </span></p>\n<p><b>“VCs tend to invest in what they know—problems they can relate to.” Tell me your thoughts on this, and what you’ve observed during your time in the and whether this is true to you as an investor. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s much easier to assess the value of a product if it’s solving a problem you can understand. Otherwise, you’re relying on the opinions of other people to determine its merits. Also, if it’s a sector you’re familiar with there’s likely better deal flow from your network. You’ll see Institutional VCs often determine their investment theses based on the experience of the partners. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I read various approaches to portfolio theory, and thought it would be wise to invest in things I knew best – female-friendly consumer tech products. Initially I took the “fund founders not (necessarily) products” adage to heart and invested in a few niche products started by people I believed were smart and competent. But as my capital amounts increased I became more discerning about the track record of the founder and the potential market size. From an ethos standpoint, I would love to invest in clean tech and education, but as these are sectors I know little about there’s an increased risk and decrease in my value-add to founders. The key advantage for me to potentially work as an institutional would be to gain knowledge from partners of these sectors. It may still happen.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I can’t tell you the number of times founders have told me that community ROI can’t be calculated. Ask any technical person what they think of marketers and they’ll likely say that they’re “creative” or “feeler” types with no methods or data to back up their initiatives. I think this has largely been perpetuated by startups hiring smart but inexperienced people to run marketing because early on they can’t afford seasoned talent. This pattern, in addition to data and dev time being protected fiercely, can make it difficult to track returns. But that’s easily solved by the right tools.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>In general, how has your experience been as a woman in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know everyone anticipates horror stories and I hate to disappoint, but I don’t feel like my path in tech was made significantly more difficult by being a woman. I think this was partially because I was in a field—marketing—that’s high percentage female. I can’t recall any instances when I felt like the target of sexism. However, there has been the conscious awareness that I mustn’t play into the stereotypes of “bad” female behavior i.e. emotional irrationality and outbursts which factors into my communication style and has influenced my feeling comfortable speaking out in opposition. As I’ve rose in the ranks I’ve also been keenly mindful as to not come off too strongly or alpha for fear of being seen as a bitch or unlikeable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I also pride myself on being somewhat stylish, I know my friendliness is often mistaken as flirtatiousness so in the past five years or so I’ve been more conservative in my apparel choices—nothing revealing or body conforming. But the reasons for doing so are not just to discourage male attention, but to remove all question of why I may be getting ahead other than my own merit. I’m sure most men never have to consider this. Truthfully, I suspect I’ve largely been shielded from some of the more overtly inappropriate behavior from men because I’ve been in a serious relationship for most of my career. </span></p>\n<p><b>What have been your biggest struggles?</b></p>\n<p>I can’t tell you the number of times founders have told me that community ROI can’t be calculated. Ask any technical person what they think of marketers and they’ll likely say that they’re “creative” or “feeler” types with no methods or data to back up their initiatives.

This pattern, in addition to data and dev time being protected fiercely, can make it difficult to track returns. But that’s easily solved by the right tools.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many marketing and community folks, I’ve had to contend with this much of my career. It’s hard enough trying to grow and engage users without having to constantly prove why you should exist. Oh, I should note that these stereotypes have shifted a bit as performance marketers have rebranded themselves as “growth hackers”. If there are any brand / community folks out there, I’ll cut to the chase: you’ll never get a lower CPA from any channel other than paid, so don’t try; instead focus on increasing LTV. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Angel investing is tricky and largely a failing proposition. You’ve heard about the power law rules of the game, right? Where one of your bets can potentially make up for all the others that have flamed out. Well, that means you’re competing for the hot deals with all the other early stage investors. Now that everyone’s an angel, getting into the deal is the hard part. So your network is everything. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Problem is, people have to know you’re doing a certain thing in order to share that type of info with you. And when I’m learning the ropes, I always shy away from the spotlight. There’s an inherent conflict, which I’ve now mostly overcome. But I’m sure I missed out on a lot in the meantime. </span></p>\n<p><b>Have you had mentors or people who’ve looked up to for inspiration along the way?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am grateful at Yelp to have had a number of bosses all strong in their own dimensions: Geoff Donaker Yelp COO with his business acumen and analytical bent, Nish Nadaraja for his creativity and engaging pen, Michelle Broderick for her direct but encouraging management style and sharp wit. Much of the time when I was an operator, I was so heads down building that I did little in the way of networking or professional development. It’s a shame in hindsight as I had access to an amazing group of investors and advisors and I regret not taking advantage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The story has played out differently with angel investing though. For many months I was afraid to tell anyone I had started, afraid of smarter people scrutinizing my picks and judging me accordingly. But after I’d grown more comfortable and started asking people in my network for their thoughts on deals I found that most were more than happy to candidly share. Kanyi Maqubela, Josh Felser, and Niko Bonatsos have all been encouraging and insightful and I am ever grateful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m a huge fan of Cyan Banister. I respect that she struck out on her own as an angel, not waiting for an institutional to invest under, and absolutely kicked ass. So stoked to hear Founders Fund brought her on as partner—couldn’t be more well deserved. From afar, I’m a great admirer of Aileen Lee and have watched or read every panel, interview, or talk she’s ever done. She’s sharp, irreverent, and downright cool. And of course a great picker. It would be a dream to work with her one day. </span></p>\n<p><b>What are your biggest motivators?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I want my brain to be stretched. I’d like to grow in so many ways: creatively, business-savvy, analytically – and I hope to be able to help people in some way during this process. </span></p>\n<p><b>Where have you found support networks?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Connecting with people that have shared plights and joys has been illuminating and validating. David Spinks gets full credit for bringing together community people through his organization and event series CMX, and I’ve met so many wonderful people that way. I’ve also gleaned valuable info and support from women in 37 Angels. The group consists of investors of various ages and backgrounds, and I’ve enjoyed their difference in perspectives. The startup scene can be a myopic echo chamber. </span></p>\n<p><b>What would you like to see change?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The “change the world” mantra of tech is a double edged sword. On one hand, it’s a boon to the industry, attracting people from all corners of the earth to try and create a company for the goodness of humanity, and to leave a meaningful legacy behind. On the other hand, it creates this immense pressure to dream bigger and solve bigger problems. I’ve seen people spiral into incredible existential crises because they don’t (yet) have an idea that will change the world on a massive scale and it makes them really unhappy. We need to allow ourselves to work on things that move us, however seemingly insignificant. Everything starts out small. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There also needs to be more people of color, women, those from developing countries, and people from various socio-economic backgrounds in VC, so that the types of problems that are being funded are speaking to the needs of a broader swath of the world.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve seen people spiral into incredible existential crises because they don’t (yet) have an idea that will change the world on a massive scale and it makes them really unhappy.

Everything starts out small.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And not to open a whole can of worms, but we need to close the gender pay gap. </span></p>\n<p><b>So what are you working on right now, either for work or for yourself?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Kim Hunter from Women Catalysts so nicely summed up, I believe that life is not a ladder, it’s a jungle gym. We don’t have to take a straight path to the top. We can be many things at different times.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier this year I started a tiny tiny microfund that invests in restaurants, something I’ve been doing occasionally over the last few years. Many will laugh as it’s often thought of as a losing proposition. But this isn’t about 100x returns for me; I’ve got reasonable IRR in mind. My motivation stems from conversations with restauranteurs and chefs; I realized they lacked a supportive ecosystem. In an affluent city such as San Francisco with such a food-obsessed populace, this didn’t seem right. I hope to create a stronger bridge between the tech and food communities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve spent years focused on my career, ignoring the other aspects of life. This phase is about reaching new professional frontiers, but also being intentional about my family life, health, spirituality, and creative side. </span></p>\n<p><b>How do your friends and family feel about the work you’ve done?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My family doesn’t really have any idea what I’ve done. They just know I have a decent amount of Google search results. As for my friends, I hope they’ve deemed me having accomplished enough to warrant their respect and esteemed company—hah!</span></p>\n<p><b>What do you think about the state of tech in 2016?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big question here. I could talk about the funding environment tightening up, how there’s no stone unturned in consumer, yadda yadda yadda. But you’ve heard it all before, I’m sure. So I’ll give you my take: I’m encouraged to see resources pouring into healthcare, clean tech, and education. But the overwhelming feeling is one of immense possibility, mostly inspired by my husband (who’s a programmer). I’m eager to see what the future holds with AI and VR/AR. In the next decade, we’re going to see massive shifts in production and human behavior with these technologies in ways we can’t possibly predict. As cliche as it sounds, I actually do feel blessed to be alive at this time in history. </span></p>\n<p><b>What advice would you give to folks from similar backgrounds who are in tech or hoping to get into it?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn a hard skill. Move to a tech hub. Hunt down companies who hope to make a dent in the world in a way you can get behind. Bang down their door. Work hard for them, for free if you have to. Develop a network of peers and mentors. Stay up on the industry happs. Help people and be kind. You’ll be amazed at what comes back in return. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Help people and be kind. You’ll be amazed at what comes back in return.&#8221;</p></blockquote>",

But generally, the only things I avoid saying are partisan things because I run a non-partisan organization. Talking about being a woman in technology, or a gay woman in technology in San Francisco, is not partisan.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Or a &#8220;loud-mouth lady gay,&#8221; as you called yourself in your application?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. Being a loud-mouth lady gay led to me realizing that, “Oh my God, I’m no longer suited to work for other people.” The last boss I ever had said that she thought I would do much better working by myself. She was correct.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Okay. So let’s start from the beginning, Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am from Brooklyn. I’m a fifth generation Brooklynite. My family has been there since 1890 on the maternal side and since 1910 or so on the paternal side. So we’re pretty run-of-the-mill Eastern European Jews who left Europe when Europe became less-hospitable. I’m from the part of the Brooklyn where the accent is from and where hipsters still don’t live. So when you think artisanal crafts, do not think of the Brooklyn that I grew up in or the Brooklyn that my mother currently lives in. My mother would have no idea by what you meant by “artisanal soap,” “artisanal candles,” “artisanal gefilte fish.” She just wouldn’t know what any of that means.</span></p>\n<p><strong>I respect that. What part?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bensonhurst.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Bensonhurst, I do not know Bensonhurst.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bensonhurst is where the “Honeymooners” took place, where “Welcome Back, Kotter” took place, and where “Saturday Night Fever” took place.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Wow, that’s really amazing. No, you don’t have an accent, but you have the East coast swagger, which I appreciate as a fellow-East coaster.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you.</span></p>\n<p><strong>When did you first get interested in tech, and separately, when did you become interested in politics?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those actually overlap a bit. I’m older than I look, so the first time that I used the internet was my first week of college. This was 1995 and I was definitely an early adopter. I was one of the first people in my circle to learn HTML, and I took some entry level design courses in college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I first became strongly interested in politics the night of the 2000 Presidential election. I was with a group of friends in North Hampton, Massachusetts, and we were watching the returns. When Florida went blue my friends were like, “Okay, great, Gore’s president,” and went to sleep. I was like, “I’m just going to stay awake and watch the rest of the returns.” This meant I was awake and alone when Florida was suddenly red.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Being a loud-mouth lady gay led to me realizing that, &#8216;Oh my God, I’m no longer suited to work for other people.&#8217; The last boss I ever had said that she thought I would do much better working by myself. She was correct.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep in mind it was the middle of the night in Florida when this happened. First the state was declared for Gore and then &#8212; what was the story? &#8212; they found a truck filled with ballots for the Republican candidate, George W. Bush. This was a very surprising thing to happen in the middle of the night, and a very surprising thing to happen in what was an overwhelmingly Jewish section of Florida. And then the recount dragged on forever and wound up at the Supreme Court. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that night was the first time I became cognizant of how important voter turnout is. The presidential election should never come down to multiple recounts of ballots in a single county in America. At the same time, I was young and doing other things with my life. In 2004, I decided it was time to get more involved in politics. I met Sharif, a man who was staring a project called Swing the State. People would register as volunteer online with Swing the State, and Sharif would help them travel into swing states to do voter registration and get out the vote work. I told Sharif I wanted to help, and that was that. I was somewhat technical at that point, and this was a highly technical project. It was really just Swing the State and MoveOn.org that were organizing volunteers online and then deploying them on the ground back then. Swing the State was my first political tech project. I just kept going from there.</span></p>\n<p><strong>So, at first, you were working in tech, and politics was a hobby?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, actually, I was investigating police misconduct for the City of New York.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Okay, walk me through this whole thing. I’m going to stop talking. You take me from the beginning.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My career path makes absolutely no sense. Let’s set the stage. It’s 2000 and I lived in Western Mass, because that’s where I thought young lesbians lived. In 2001, I came to my senses and moved back to New York, because it turned out that Western Mass is actually where middle-aged lesbians live. So, I moved back to New York, and puttered around for a bit. In 2004 I got a job investigating police misconduct for the City of New York. This was an awesome job: I had a badge, and cops had to answer to me, and that was great. I met Sharif that year and started running Swing the State in my spare time with Sharif and about ten of our friends. This was a fiercely partisan project. We were like, “We do not want George W. Bush to win re-election. That would be terrible, we must put an immediate end to this.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 2004 election did not work out the way we wanted the 2004 election to work out. I continued investigating police misconduct until 2007. Then I got a phone call from a friend from college and he offered me a job at MySpace.com. I literally hadn’t heard from this guy in years. Do you remember MySpace?</span></p>\n<p><strong>I was very active on MySpace. It took me a long time to get it out of my top Google results.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, that’s really funny. I was active on Friendster and then someone I worked with investigating police misconduct literally said to me, “Oh that’s right, you’re old. You people are all still on Friendster. Young people are on MySpace.” And I was like, “I’m young too!” So I created a MySpace profile that I literally never checked. I never really used MySpace until my friend from college called to offer me this job. I was wholly unqualified for this job —I feel like this is a key part of this story. But he knew that I had been running a civic tech project, and as far as he was concerned this meant i worked in technology. I was like, “No, no, no, I have passion projects in technology.” But, you know, this was 2007 and you could accept jobs that you weren’t remotely qualified for. So in 2007 I stopped investigating police misconduct, moved from New York City to Los Angeles, and started working at MySpace.com when MySpace was pretty much the center of the online universe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got to LA and realized I didn’t actually have any friends in LA. This meant I had a lot of downtime and decided it was time to start another election project. And that’s where Long Distance Voter comes from. From me not having any friends in Los Angeles.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;This was 2007 and you could accept jobs that you weren’t remotely qualified for. So in 2007 I stopped investigating police misconduct, moved from New York City to Los Angeles, and started working at MySpace.com when MySpace was pretty much the center of the online universe.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>That’s beautiful.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s amazing what not having friends will do for your spare time and your creative drive. So backing up a bit, in 2004 I thought that the best way to increase voter turnout was to register more voters. This was a very common thought back then. So Swing the State and our partner groups, like Acorn and America Coming Together (rest in peace both groups), were part of this massive, nationwide, voter registration effort. At the end of the day, it didn’t seem to have much of an impact on turnout. Progressives were out registering conservatives four to one, but we certainly weren’t winning elections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By 2006, I started to wonder if voter registration was related to voter turnout in any way. I’m not an academic, I didn’t have an actual funds to study this, but my gut told me to focus on something other than voter registration. I decided that my next project was going to focus on some group of people who were already registered to vote, who were highly motivated to vote, and who had some sort of roadblock that I could clear using the internet. If we’re being honest, I mostly wanted to stop doing door-to-door voter registration. I’d done a ton of that in 2004 and 2006 and it was just terrible. So late in 2006 I decided I would never again carry a clipboard. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, so now it’s 2006 and I’m in Vegas—where all great ideas are born—at a brand new political conference called Yearly Kos. A group of us were sitting around, and my friend John wanted to go ride a mechanical bull. Everyone was drunk, and I was like, “Do not go ride a mechanical bull. This is a terrible idea. Instead of riding a mechanical bull, I need you to help me figure out something.” And John was like, “What?” I was like, “I need to come up with a group of people who are already registered to vote, who are highly motivated to vote, have some sort of roadblock that we can clear using the Internet, because I really, really do not want to have to go door-to-door every again.” And he was like, “What about absentee voters?” And I was like, “What?” And he was like, “When I did absentee in college, it was really confusing and I’m still not sure if my absentee ballot was counted. Is anyone running an absentee ballot project?” And I was like, “I don’t think so.” And he was like, “Great, we should do that,” and then went off to ride this mechanical bull. And that is Long Distance Voter’s origin story.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’m working at Myspace during the day as a product manager. So during the day I’m identifying what people need from the internet, and what sort of tools we should build, and how you could run an engineering team. At night, I’m working with my friends, and we’re doing our nerdy voting project. I continued this pattern of having working as a product manager during the day, and volunteering with my friends to save democracy at night, through several jobs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t remember how riding the mechanical bull worked out for John. He obviously lived to the morning, because we were all fine the next day. Anyway, that conversation happened in 2006. In 2007, I moved to Los Angeles, had no friends, and reached back out to John about his absentee ballot website. John and I recruited a bunch of our former coworkers (we had all investigated police misconduct together for the City of New York) and we started building the Long Distance Voter website. We had $5,000. I think there were ten of us—there were ten of us. Everyone took five states. We called the Secretaries of State, we asked them to walk us through it. We called every Secretary of State in America, and we asked them how you voted absentee in their state. (This is incredibly boring, I realize. Just picture us all investigating police misconduct, that makes it more exciting.) We built what was essentially a Wiki, with one page per state, and we had our first half million visitors within six months. So, we were like, “Alright, let’s keep doing this. We’re awesome.” And so we kept working on the site. Everyone was a volunteer. </span></p>\n<p>We added more features to the site because users asked us to. People asked, “Hey, how come you don’t have a voter registration tool?” So we threw the Rock the Vote voter registration tool into the site, and quickly became Rock the Vote’s number one partner &#8212; in terms of registrations &#8212; out of 500 groups using their tool. People started asking us when early voting happens, so we created early voting page which is still the first hit on Google. So we just kept going with the site.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, I’m working at Myspace during the day as a product manager. So during the day I’m identifying what people need from the internet, and what sort of tools we should build, and how you could run an engineering team. At night, I’m working with my friends, and we’re doing our nerdy voting project. I continued this pattern of having working as a product manager during the day, and volunteering with my friends to save democracy at night, through several jobs. </span></p>\n<p><strong>That’s amazing.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you. It makes no sense though. Everyone in voting assumed this was my full-time job. I’ve been Debra Cleaver from Long Distance Voters since 2008. At the same exact time, I was Debra Cleaver from Myspace, then Debra Cleaver from Truecar.com, and then Debra Cleaver from Change.org. It’s like I was Batman, but less cool. I had an election alter ego who did not get to wear a mask and a suit.</span></p>\n<p><strong>I feel like we’ve I’ve heard a lot of exciting things you’ve worked on, have we missed any of the really proud and exciting things?</strong></p>\n<p>No. Honestly, spending my twenties investigating police misconduct for the City of New York was awesome. I would also say—and this is a fact—that the New York City Police Department is the best trained, most heavily regulated, police department in the world. The fact that New York City has civilian oversight is really meaningful. A lot of the nonsense that happens in other places does not happen in New York, or doesn’t happen without immediate repercussion. New York City’s Internal Affairs Bureau is the model for Internal Affairs departments throughout the country. Living outside of New York, I’m astonished that there are police departments with no civilian oversight. If the police are only accountable to themselves, and not to civilians, then we are living in a police state. That is the literal definition of a police state: one where the police are only accountable to themselves. In New York City, the police are ultimately accountable to the civilians that they police. That doesn’t seem to to be the case outside of New York. New York City is certainly not without its racial and systemic biases, obviously, but it never felt like the wild west. Outside of New York, things seem nuts right now in terms of police misconduct.</p>\n<p><strong>What have been your biggest struggles over your career path, be it directly related to work or even personal? What have been the hardships you’ve had to overcome?</strong></p>\n<p>I loved investigating police misconduct. It was just awesome. I was also our union shop steward. In addition to investigating police misconduct and running Swing the State with my friends, I also engaged in a three-year battle with management. I filed all these large group grievances against management, and won them all, and that was just amazing. So I had this really amazing time, investigating police misconduct, and being a bad-ass, and driving the management nuts, and being a union shop steward. And then one day I realized, “I need to get the hell out of government.” Once you win massive group grievances, your career is pretty much over, you’re black-balled.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Working at MySpace was amazing. If you saw a woman in the engineering department, there was a very good chance she was in charge of her team. The MySpace technical team was run by women. So my introduction to working in tech was to have all these bad-ass, fierce, unapologetic women running the show.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, MySpace came at the exact right time. Working at MySpace was amazing. If you saw a woman in the engineering department, there was a very good chance she was in charge of her team. The MySpace technical team was run by women. So my introduction to working in tech was to have all these bad-ass, fierce, unapologetic women running the show. The women were incredibly smart and really scary, and they’ve accepted me as one of their own, and I always had a great time at work. The guys at work would tell me that that wasn’t the case at other tech companies and that their wives and girlfriends had a much harder time working in tech. And, I said, “Oh, that’s weird, because I feel like MySpace is female dominated.” And they were like, “Well, MySpace is the exception to the rule.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then, I went to work at TrueCar.com, which was an automotive tech company. It was male dominated, but still a really wonderful professional experience. It wasn’t fun, the way MySpace was fun, but everyone was a professional. We came in, we did our work, and we were all paid well, so we were motivated by money, not necessarily our love for the automotive industry. Even though it was a predominantly male staff, I never thought it was a boy’s club. And then I moved to San Francisco, and the San Francisco tech scene was unlike anything I’d ever seen.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Tell me more.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I came to San Francisco tech companies and I suddenly was surrounded by people who had never heard of professionalism. Everything from “please show up to work on time” to “please do not tell jokes during the day, this is inappropriate”. I’ve never considered professionalism and fun to be at odds. I was like, “Professionalism is what enables a diverse group of people to together.” My team at Myspace was widely regarded as one of the happiest teams in the company, and Myspace was a big company. My team was 50% loudmouth white homosexual, and 50% somewhat quiet engineer who had grown up in India. So this was not a group of people that you would expect would really gel, but we did. The quieter coworkers kept the loudmouths from being bonkers and off the wall. And the loudmouth homosexuals made things light hearted and fun. And we were absolutely the happiest team in the company, and professionalism was why we could work together. Ken, my lead developer, is a wonderful person, also a devout Christian. So just during the day I didn’t make off-color comments about religion, because that would inappropriate. We just didn’t make off-color race or gender jokes in general, cause that would be inappropriate. So we had this team at Myspace that was diverse in terms, and race, and religion, and country of origin, and still managed to laugh all day, every day.</span></p>\n<p>Then I moved to San Francisco, and suddenly things were just not funny. It’s not funny when you’re in HipChat, and someone is literally telling dick jokes. And it’s not funny when you’re the only woman on a team of 35. I’m used to having more men than women on a team, but I’m certainly not used to having 35 men and one woman. And I’ve found that when you build a homogenous team, people forget all about professionalism because they don’t have to moderate their behavior to accommodate people who aren’t exactly like them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Then I moved to San Francisco, and suddenly things were just not funny.

And it’s not funny when you’re the only woman on a team of 35.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’d never actually articulated to myself, &#8216;I work in a boys’ club&#8217; until I started working in SF. I’m a short-haired, loud-mouthed dyke and I’m very comfortable with predominantly male environments. But a boys’ club is very different beast entirely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might need to pepper me with some questions now because good Lord, do I have stories. So many stories.</span></p>\n<p><strong>What have some of your experiences been like?</strong></p>\n<p>Okay, some of the stories are just kind of hilarious. I had one software engineer who would groom at his desk. He’d trim his nails and comb his very long beard and it was just kind of weird. And his hygiene just wasn’t great. Really sweet guy, but terrible hygiene. And he would take off his shoes and his feet smelled terrible. I just pulled his boss aside and was like, “You got to deal with this. We have to have a shoes on policy at work.” His boss looked pretty uncomfortable, but there was no way I was going to deal with that mess. I told the boss, “Maybe you can talk to the boys about hygiene. You don’t need to say any of us have brought it up but it would be great if people could bathe once a week. That would really be great.” That’s a funny story: you don’t expect to have to tell a 40-year old man to bathe, but not the end of the world.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’ve found that when you build a homogenous team, people forget all about professionalism because they don’t have to moderate their behavior to accommodate people who aren’t exactly like them.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Less funny story. At one job a software engineer punched another software engineer in the face at the holiday Christmas party. Boys will be boys, I guess. One of the boys was mouthing off at another one of the boys, and the second boy had enough of it and punched the first boy in the face. On one hand, I would say a lot of us had wanted to punch this guy in the face. On the other hand, but you may fantasize about punching a co-worker in the face but you don’t actually do it. And they weren’t boys—they were grown men and we were at the company Christmas party. There was an open bar, and everybody was drunk and dancing, and out of the corner of my eye, I see people who look like bouncers and I think, “Those look like bouncers.” And then I immediately realize those are actual bouncers because one of the engineers just punched another engineer in the face. So that wasn’t great [chuckles]. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was like great, “I’m getting out of here.” And the CEO literally catches me as I’m leaving and he’s like, “Hey, what just happened?” And I was like, “Well, one of your engineers just punched another one of your engineers in the face.” And he was like, “Why?” And I was like, “I don’t know. I haven’t ever punched anyone in the face so I can’t really imagine.” And he’s like, “But you have to have some idea.” And I’m like, “Well, first, your engineers are a bunch of man children, and second of all the one who was punched in the face is really objectively very annoying, so he probably mouthed off to someone who’s much bigger than him and got hit in the face.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point I’m just trying to leave because I was pretty drunk—there had been an open bar—and I’m like, “I just cannot be talking to this jackass CEO right now.” And he’s like still talking to me, and I was like, “Hey, I’m not trying to tell you how to run your business but you need to call the company attorney, like right now.” And he’s like, “No, no, I don’t think it’s a big deal. I don’t think we need an attorney.” And I’m like, “One of your employees just punched another employee in the face at a company-sponsored event. You need an attorney.” And he’s like, “No, no.” And I was like, “Oh my God, how can I make this clearer to you?” I said, “You need the other gay Jew. I am your product manager, the other gay Jew is your attorney. You need that gay Jew. I cannot help you with this situation. I don’t know why one of them punched another one in the face, but I do know that you need an attorney.” And, of course, the next day the attorney was like, “Thank you for having him call me.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I would also routinely wind up the only woman in a room of company leaders. This was a global company so we had 20 country directors at least 50%, maybe 60%, were women. But if we had a meeting of the country leaders, we would only fly men in.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This situation was ironic because just a few hours before the Christmas party another product manager and I had gone to the CEO to the lack of professionalism with the engineers. He was like, “What do you mean?” And I was like, Well, in the past week, one of them stood up and yelled at another one for no apparent reason. Another decided that he’d had enough of a meeting that we were in, so he slammed the table and announced that he was “done talking about this.” And what he was done talking about was literally his team’s plan to finish a project, so he stormed out. We had another male engineer—I should stop saying male engineers, actually, they were all men—throw something in a meeting because he also didn’t feel like he should keep answering questions. And the questions were always about work, like, “When will this be done?”, or, “Can you help us understand why this project is four weeks late because we have outside partners who are waiting.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So anyway, the day of the holiday party I went to the CEO to talk about the lack of professionalism, and several hours later one of the engineers punched another one in the face. Way to underscore my point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">God that was a long-winded story. I would also routinely wind up the only woman in a room of company leaders. This was a global company so we had 20 country directors at least 50%, maybe 60%, were women. But if we had a meeting of the country leaders, we would only fly men in.</span></p>\n<p><strong>What??</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right? So I started talking to the CEO about this, calling him out. The first time I walked into his office and said, “Hey, I think we need to talk. I just left a meeting of 15 people and I was the only woman in the room. And the only reasons I was there is that I happen to be based out of San Francisco, and the meeting was here, and I couldn’t help but notice that you didn’t fly any women in.” And he was like, “What do you mean?” And I was like, “More than 50% of the country directors are women. So when you were choosing who to fly in, why didn’t you choose to fly any of them in?” And he was like, “Oh, I hadn’t thought about that.” And I told him, point blank, “Listen, it’s pretty uncomfortable for me to say this, but I think you’re running like a boys’ club here. I don’t think this is conscious, but when you personally picture leadership, you seem to only be picturing men, and we need to think about what that means for our company.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There would be these meetings with say me, and the CEO, and say two other men. And I would just pitch an idea at CEO, and he’d say, &#8216;Well, that’s a terrible idea.&#8217; And one of the other guys would repeat verbatim what I had maybe five minutes later (because we would have all agreed going into the meeting like that was the best plan), and the CEO would be say &#8216;That’s a great idea! Debra, why don’t you come up with ideas like this?'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>And at first he seemed pretty responsive to this, but nothing actually changed. I was good friends with the head of HR and we started to have unofficial conversations about this. Then then they became official conversations. And, oh my god, there would be these meetings with say me, and the CEO, and say two other men. And I would just pitch an idea at CEO, and he’d say, “Well, that’s a terrible idea.” And one of the other guys would repeat verbatim what I had maybe five minutes later (because we would have all agreed going into the meeting like that was the best plan), and the CEO would be say “That’s a great idea! Debra, why don’t you come up with ideas like this?”</p>\n<p>The first time it happened everyone laughed because we all thought the CEO was kidding. And the CEO asks us why we’re laughing and one of the guys says, “Well, I mean this is Debra’s exact idea. She just said this five minutes ago.” And I was like, “Yeah, that’s my exact idea.” And the CEO was honestly confused. It was like he hadn’t been in the room at all. That was the first time I had encountered sexism that was like cartoonish in nature.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It started to feel like a comical exercise in gender stereotyping, only it wasn’t actually funny.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was at that company for about a year and a half. It reached the point where the conversations with HR were no longer unofficial, and the CEO and I would get into it regularly. I would say things to him like, “Hey, your revenue projections are nonsensical. I can’t even imagine where you’re getting these numbers from, but based on our actual revenue patterns, we’re going to have layoffs.” And he would say, “Well, you’re just not being optimistic.” And I was say, “No, I’m just being realistic. We have a huge staff, so I think this is a problem.” Other times he would say that I wasn’t metric-driven, which was really bizarre to me since I was always trying to talk to him about revenue. Once after he told me that I wasn’t “metric driven” I said, “I don’t know ‘metric driven’ means what you think it means, but the metric that I want to discuss with you is revenue. Revenue is a fancy way to say the money we need to operate our company. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whenever I try to talk to you about revenue, you shoot down the conversation, but then you want to spend literally hours every day second guessing every minor decision I make because you’re worried that it will have only a .4% increase in conversions instead of .6%.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This became a constant refrain with him. He would routinely say, “Well, you’re just not numbers driven,” or “Debra, you don’t have good ideas.” Because money clearly wasn’t an important metric . And it started to feel like a comical exercise in gender stereotyping, only it wasn’t actually funny. </span></p>\n<p>I was going to leave, but then we got this new female president. I decided to stick around, and see if things improved. Things got really shitty, and literally I would get criticized for the tone of voice that I used in email. As if emails have a tone. During the last two months the president started telling me—I am not making this up—that I needed to smile more during the day. But the reason I stopped smiling was that it was just not fun to come into work. My guys—my team—actually noticed and asked if I was mad at them. And I was like, “What do you mean?” And they were like, “You used to joke around with us every morning and now you don’t joke around at all. You just put your headphones on and you work.” And I was like, “No, no, I’m not mad at you guys. I have things going on in life.” I was amazed that they’d noticed because, like lots of straight men who work in engineering, they were just completely oblivious to what was going on around them.</p>\n<p>Oh, and the one performance review I had read like that that article that was going on around on Facebook that highlighted the phrases and that are only used in women’s performance reviews. Like “abrasive.” I was “abrasive.” We did 360 reviews and this feedback came from from male colleagues who hadn’t been pulling their weight at all until I was on staff. I would say to them things like, “Hey, we pay you six figures and in return for that we expect you to do the work that you’re assigned during the day in a reasonable timeframe.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m trying to think of funny stories for you, but none of this was funny. My life was a parody of stereotypical sexist behavior. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Man, you worked at a comical extreme it sounds like.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amazing thing about this is I had just left this automotive tech company, which was just not like that at all. It was professional, it was fine and sometimes I was the only woman in a room, but only because it’s tends to be men who are jazzed at the thought of working at an automotive tech company. The company where I had the most negative experience was a social enterprise where people really prided themselves on how aware they were of systemic racism and sexism and things like that. Irony alert.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Major.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you want to know how that ended? This is the only good part about this entire situation. There was this project that the CEO was really stoked on even though it was a really stupid idea. It was a clusterfuck of a project but my team took it on because we’d been working on something else forever and needed a change. I spoke to the heads of every major division in the company and we figured out literally the only path forward. I got buy off from everyone before talking to the CEO. Then someone’s assistant scheduled like seven hours of meetings, and I was like, “We don’t need seven hours of meetings, but whatever.” </span></p>\n<p>We start the very first meeting, there was a room full of people, and I said to the CEO “Hey listen, everyone in the company has agreed there’s only one path forward, so all we really need right now from you, CEO, is for you to sign off on this path forward so everyone can get started.” And he spends the next seven hours laying into me as a person. How it’s clear I “haven’t really thought about the project” and “I’m not taking it seriously”. After a few hours I pulled the other product managers into the meetings as well because I needed backup. Both of them repeatedly told the CEO that we all agreed that there was only one path forward. So the CEO starts saying how it’s clear (somehow) that I&#8217;m “not thinking about the metrics and blah, blah, blah.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So seven hours later, it’s time to leave for the day, and someone has scheduled some dinner that I’m supposed to go to. But I’m in tears, which has never happened to be before at work (don’t worry, no one saw). And I called a friend from New York. This guy has known me for two decades, and assumes someone has died because I’m crying. And I tell him, ”I’m crying because I have feelings. And I’m not used to having feelings. And I don’t know what to do about this.” My friend tells me, ”Go home, get a pint of ice cream, and watch Scandal or something.” And I’m telling him I can’t just go home because there’s some fucking dinner I have to attend. And he was like, ”Okay. You know how to handle this. Do not talk during the dinner. Just sit at the edge of the table and drink your wine and don’t talk to anyone.” And I was like, ”Okay. Got it. Just drink quietly.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;So finally I say, &#8216;You wanna know what’s going on?&#8217; And I held up my fork and said, &#8216;I would rather stab out my own eyes with this motherfucking fork than talk about our goddamn job or our goddamn misogynistic prick of a CEO.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I get there and no one’s there, and I start drinking. Everyone else was a full 30 minutes late. And then we sit down and I’m like at the very end of the table, and someone’s like, “Hey, Debra, come sit at the head of the table.” Because normally I’m the funny one. And I’m like, ”Oh, fuck.” But I tell myself, ”Just keep drinking. Just keep drinking. You have this plan.” And everyone keeps trying to engage me in conversations, but I’m not willing to talk. And none of these people have ever seen me not say a word for 90 minutes, so it’s starting to get weird that I’m not talking. </span></p>\n<p>Someone, I can’t remember who, just wouldn’t let it go and kept trying to engage me in conversation. And at this point I had probably a bottle of wine on my own, and I was like, “I just don’t really want to talk right now.” And someone’s like, “No, for real. You’ve never been quiet this long. What’s going on? Blah blah blah.” And they just kept trying to talk to me about work and about the meetings we’d just had and whatnot. So finally I say, “You wanna know what’s going on?” And I held up my fork and said, “I would rather stab out my own eyes with this motherfucking fork than talk about our goddamn job or our goddamn misogynistic prick of a CEO.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then I went back to eating my food while everyone else sat there stunned and quiet. I ate my food, finished my bottle of wine, went home, the next day took a sick day, and the next day was told to come into work at 8AM (which is two hours before I get to work) to be fired. And so ended my illustrious career working for someone else. Misogynistic prick in question did not fire me himself, he had a woman do it. And while she was firing me, she was said, “I am really sorry about his behavior the other day.” Because she had been there in the all-day meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I still think that the fork incident was my finest professional moment. I can see how calling calling someone a misogynistic prick would be a problem, if it wasn’t objectively true. But in my defense, he was a misogynistic prick. This was just a statement of fact.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an aside, the guy who punched the other guy in the face—not fired. The guy who’s throwing things in meetings—not fired. The guy who posted a bunch of swastikas on Facebook publicly while identifying the company he worked for—not fired. None of these people were fired. Me—a bottle of wine in, state objective truth about our boss—fired. So, I don’t know. I still think it was a good way to go out.</span></p>\n<p><strong>How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? What excites you and what frustrates you?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve never been interested in technology for technology’s sake. I’m not like, “Look at this awesome app that I downloaded that lets me throw angry birds at something.” I’ve always been interested in technology as a way to solve other problems. In 2004 when I first started wading into this political work it my question was, “How can we use the internet to organize volunteers?” Now, I look at the internet as a whole and think, “this is the most powerful and least expensive information distribution system we have ever seen.” The internet is the single most important advancement in human communication and information distribution since the printing press. Only it’s cheap It’s accessible for everyone. You could host a website for seven bucks a month at DreamHost and the whole world can see it.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’ve never been interested in technology for technology’s sake. I’ve always been interested in technology as a way to solve other problems.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For me it’s not that we’re going to solve the issues plaguing American democracy with technology, it’s that we can use technology to amplify the solutions we’ve already identified. I’ve focused on education—how can we educate all Americans about voting without spending a bajillion dollars? We can use the internet. Every day I see so many examples of people using technology in creative ways to solve problems that are much bigger than “how am I going to get my laundry done” or “where can I find a taxi.” I love what we can do with technology, but I don’t necessarily love technology itself. I will use the most boring, established, non-sparkly technology to solve really big problems.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;For me it’s not that we’re going to solve the issues plaguing American democracy with technology, it’s that we can use technology to amplify the solutions we’ve already identified.

The younger women entering the field now have mentors that women my age didn’t necessarily have. And these mentors have had enough of this weird, sexist bullshit. There are a number of women in tech groups, and lesbians in tech, and a consistent topic of conversation is how do we protect these younger women? How can we make sure that sexism doesn’t thrive in the valley? And what do you do when your team is off the wall bonkers and out of control? A lot of us also think about how lack of diversity affects not just the companies, but the world. Who has access to technology and therefore who has access to information. There is so much thoughtful conversation going on around access issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve personally come to believe that your user base will resemble your staff. If you have a staff that is 90% white men, you might wind up with user base that is 90% white men because your team will build a product that meets the needs of the people they know. You have these companies that are hegemonist and therefore the solutions they come out with are pretty defined and not very creative. In my field the way that plays out is through the techniques we use to reach underrepresented voters. We’re talking about low income voters, voters of color, young voters, urban voters. Basically people who aren’t straight white men. Traditional voter outreach tactics don’t seem to reach these groups, likely because elections and campaigns are generally run by straight white men. So these men run campaigns that speak to other straight white men, and a significant percentage of potential voters are left out of the fold. If we want to have an electorate that isn’t just straight white men, and we want to have candidates that aren’t just straight white men, we need to bring people who aren’t straight white men into the fold. I want to reach the people who are not being reached, and therefore I will not build a team of all straight white men, even if I live in San Francisco. If we all look the same, we’re going to reach the people who are already being reached.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’ve personally come to believe that your user base will resemble your staff.

And just see right now in 2016, there is some sort of shift going on, and people are calling out the lack of diversity, they’re calling out the VCs, they’re calling out the CEOs.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Yeah, it could be why we’ve hit a wall with a lot of these unicorns, of like—you had all the potential to globalize, but at some point you hit a wall.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, you somehow were unable to reach people who didn’t look exactly like you. And it turns out there’s only so many users who look exactly like your team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, i just read a quote the other day on Facebook that was great. “When the lights come on, a unicorn is just a horse in a party hat with a fake horn.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These unicorns, when you remove the VC funding, they’re often just failed companies.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>So tell me a bit about your early years and where you&#8217;ve come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I was born and raised in Miami, Florida. At some point pretty early on someone identified that I wasn&#8217;t just good at math, I really liked it and so a few teachers over the years tried encouraging that, and then in a high school there was a teacher who picked up on it and said, &#8220;If you like math I&#8217;ve got something else you should start doing.” So he got me into programming because it was a lot of applied math. From there it took off like a rocket. I went to—a couple exceptional teachers notwithstanding—a really not-great public high school. I got into a top college for computer science. I spent five years working hard, not getting enough sleep, operating on probably unsafe amounts of caffeine, learning a lot, being around some really smart people, really intimidating people, learning how to socialize with people who were not just smart but interested in these things that I found interesting, which was new for me in my life.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was used to being on the outside. I was into math and computers and other people were into cars and sports.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was used to being on the outside. I was into math and computers and other people were into cars and sports. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with them having their interests but I didn&#8217;t have anyone else who shared mine. That changed when I got to college and it was amazing to have an environment that was basically built for doing that, for going and chasing something I&#8217;m interested in to the extreme. I didn&#8217;t do it perfect, right? I don&#8217;t think anyone does. I think a lot of people would go make some different decisions if they did college again, but that&#8217;s how it goes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had some summer internships out in California. My senior year I interviewed with Uber because—it&#8217;s funny because at the time one of the things that was intensely frustrating to me about my life was how difficult it was for me to get around Pittsburgh as a student. Just as someone who couldn&#8217;t afford to own a car in a place that needed one. Then I heard about Uber and thought, “that’s a path forward—that’s a way for people to not own cars.” So in 2013 I applied, 2014 I start my job after graduating. I&#8217;m actually working toward something I really do believe is good for the world. Working towards this future where individuals don&#8217;t have to own a car to survive and making things safer because people suck at driving, making driving a skill that people can get paid for rather than requiring everyone learn it.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;A couple close friends knew that I thought of myself as a woman, but that wasn&#8217;t a public-facing thing. It was actually a huge source of distress in my life. There was this thing that I feel about myself, that I just can&#8217;t tell the world in general.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In parallel to the technical growth, I&#8217;d had struggles about my gender for a while. I presented as male basically until I graduated college. A couple close friends knew that I thought of myself as a woman, but that wasn&#8217;t a public-facing thing. It was actually a huge source of distress in my life. There was this thing that I feel about myself, that I just can&#8217;t tell the world in general. I felt really unsafe—I felt like I couldn&#8217;t come out in college, so moving across the country and starting my first job, coming from Pittsburgh to California felt like getting the chance to start my life with a clean slate. If there was anyone I knew in college who I didn&#8217;t want to talk to, who I thought wouldn&#8217;t like me, I didn&#8217;t have to deal with them. I was just in a different place, way bigger. I moved across the country, came out of the closet, and started a new job in the span of two weeks. Everyone tells me I&#8217;m crazy, but I think there&#8217;s no better way to do it. You want a clean break, everything&#8217;s new. I&#8217;ve been out and about and living as genuinely me as possible ever since starting this job, and I have never been happier. It&#8217;s been rad.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I moved across the country, came out of the closet, and started a new job in the span of two weeks.

I&#8217;ve been out and about and living as genuinely me as possible ever since starting this job, and I have never been happier. It&#8217;s been rad.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>What was college like for you, both academically and personally, as someone who didn&#8217;t totally feel like they could be yourself?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a lot of ways, college was the first step in me feeling more comfortable being myself. In primary school—elementary, middle, and high school—being the smart person in the room, being the person who cared about school in the room, wasn&#8217;t taken well; that was something I learned to hide. And then going to college, and being able to chase that was awesome. There were some decisions I made that weren&#8217;t the best. I wish I&#8217;d had a better sense of how to manage my time before I got to college so I could&#8217;ve gotten more out of it, things like that. But being able to care about this and having that be okay and having no one judging me for that was great.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like I got a lot out of college and I regret not learning more, but at the same time there is this thing that&#8217;s core to me. More than what I do, it&#8217;s how I relate to myself that I couldn&#8217;t share with the rest of the world—or at least I felt like I couldn&#8217;t share it to the rest of the world. It wasn&#8217;t pleasant. There were times where I felt totally miserable, that this is going to be bad forever, that I&#8217;m never going to be able to fix this, that I&#8217;m never going to feel comfortable coming out because I had really weird notions about what that would require, what that meant, or what the objective was, and was just confused. I didn&#8217;t have anyone to talk to about it because there weren&#8217;t that many other trans people at school. There was one who was in school at the same time as me, and we talked some, and she&#8217;s really cool, but still her experience was in a lot of ways very different. When I moved—When I eventually came out, and moved across the country, she did that before she got to college. She was four years ahead of me and that was part of what got me thinking about doing this. Well, maybe I could just be myself and be happy for that when I eventually moved away—moved to California. But it was hard. There were times when it seemed world-consuming, and I felt like my relationships with people were false because they were predicated on this presentation that was not true, wasn&#8217;t genuine. People who got along with me, I felt they got along with me because of a lie. That was awful.</span></p>\n<p><b>So, you moved here with 100 bucks.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s this thing that a lot of companies do where you have some moving bonus, or some signing bonus but they&#8217;re done as reimbursement. So, I&#8217;m like I need to get out of here. I have enough to buy a plane ticket. A friend had been out here for awhile, and had savings before they even graduated college, gave me a very generous personal loan—they did me a huge personal favor, and covered the down payment on my apartment. &#8220;This is a no interest loan. Pay it back whenever you can.&#8221; That&#8217;s still—oh, my God. That&#8217;s so valuable to me. I could have crashed on someone&#8217;s couch for a while. That would have just been really, really bad for a bunch of reasons, and I would have gotten off to a horrible start while trying to balance all these other things with not having a private space.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The first day I went out wearing a skirt and presenting as a girl I was instantly cat-called 50 feet from my front door.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>And finding a place is so hard in the first place. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was huge for me. But I drained my bank account buying a plane ticket. There was $100 left and I didn&#8217;t have a wardrobe—at least I didn&#8217;t have the right wardrobe. I had to use some creativity and find some good finds at thrift shops and stuff. I start my job and—I remember my first paycheck was needed to buy basic things, and ensuring I have enough money to be able to feed myself. Thinking I could have fed myself cheaper after every meal was not a pleasant feeling. So being able to not have to worry about food was cool. I remember a second paycheck though. I thought, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to spend an irresponsible portion of my net worth on a mattress [chuckles].&#8221; It was my first adult purchase—a really, really nice mattress. I don&#8217;t regret it in the least.</span></p>\n<p><b>For sure [laughter]. Tell me about coming out at the same time as starting Uber and what that process has been like for you.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The thing I really want to stress is I don&#8217;t want this to come off as me dishing on the company, or it&#8217;s so bad because this is all I&#8217;ve got. I just want to make that clear. I know I don&#8217;t have to say that, I just feel more comfortable saying it.</span></p>\n<p><b>Absolutely.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The option was come out before I started my job or come out after. I decided to do it before. Basically, everything all at once is new.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The first day I went out wearing a skirt and presenting as a girl I was instantly cat-called 50 feet from my front door. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And that is the weirdest experience of my life, I still don’t know how to process that. You know? At the one time it&#8217;s really gross and disgusting and dangerous and I&#8217;m scared. And on the other hand it is upsettingly validating, especially for someone who is worried they won’t be read as female, right? For that to happen to you. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;well okay.&#8221; Oh God, that was weird.</span></p>\n<p><b>Welcome. [chuckles]</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yea I know, right? That&#8217;s what everyone told me. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hi, yeah this is it.&#8221; I didn’t think women were making it up, and you can say you believe them and you know it happens to them but experiencing it is another thing entirely. So that was weird. But ignoring everything else—so like .3% of the US population is trans. Male or female, .3 right? So that’s about 1 in 300. That’s pretty small, right? So the odds of there being another trans person at any company I interviewed with was low and I was sure I was going to be the first wherever I ended up working. And a lot of people haven&#8217;t interacted with a trans person before. I&#8217;m six foot one, I had streaks of pink hair, because I don&#8217;t believe in half measures, if I&#8217;m going to stand out I&#8217;m going to stand out on my terms. [chuckle] I have a deeper voice than one would expect out of someone wearing a skirt. I stand out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of it I think was imagined, just me being paranoid about it, and some of it was that definitely that I attract attention. Every time I would get up to go to the bathroom—by the end of the second week I&#8217;m sure it wasn&#8217;t actually happening anymore but for the first two months I felt like heads were turning every time I would get up to go do something. I was big and noticeable and habitually not wearing pants, I don’t even own jeans anymore, I only wear skirts, so there&#8217;s this skirt flapping behind me because I usually wear full length skirts. I drew attention, or felt like I did, and it didn’t feel like good attention, I was extremely self-conscious. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point I&#8217;m a lot more comfortable with it, but it was weird at the time. it happened to me everywhere. I couldn&#8217;t walk down the street without people—I could feel their eyes on me, I could see them staring at me. Now I&#8217;ve gotten into this habit—I used to avoid eye contact at all costs thinking “please don&#8217;t look at me, please don&#8217;t look at me.” Now if I catch people staring at me I take my sunglasses off and stare them down. I shouldn&#8217;t have to feel bad about being me. Nothing is wrong with me. There are things that are imperfect with me, but there&#8217;s nothing offensive about me walking down the street. I shouldn&#8217;t have to defend who I am to randoms on the street.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m six foot one, I had streaks of pink hair, because I don&#8217;t believe in half measures, if I&#8217;m going to stand out I&#8217;m going to stand out on my terms. I have a deeper voice than one would expect out of someone wearing a skirt. I stand out.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So at work you can imagine it being a technology company, have a company Q&amp;A session in the style of Google. Every Tuesday we&#8217;d have a staff meeting plus Q&amp;A session. I think my second month I had a question I wanted to ask. So I get up and I ask it at the microphone. There&#8217;s a ton of people in this room. When I ask the question these people can see me on the screen. They’re probably thinking okay there&#8217;s a girl coming to ask a question. They can see the skirt and long hair, I read as female. Then they hear my voice and every head spins to look at me. For all I know they were doing that for every question (and months later I pay attention and they are doing it for every question), but I’m recently out and self conscious, so I feel like it’s because my voice was so unexpected. No one made a big deal about my gender, but after that if I would be put on meetings for things related to what I was working on and I wouldn&#8217;t know any of the names on the meeting list, but I&#8217;d walk in and every single person would know me by name from asking that question. I can&#8217;t walk into a room and hide anymore. I don&#8217;t blend in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It used to be the case that if I got attention I was asking for it. I didn&#8217;t get all the attention I was asking for, but I generally didn&#8217;t receive unwanted attention. Now whether or not I want it I&#8217;m getting it. I have difficulty with names so it&#8217;s double awkward and I feel mortified every time someone greets me by name and I don&#8217;t recognize them. I just feel bad about it. There was a lot of—at least in grade school—conditioning to be shy. I felt like I couldn&#8217;t really be good friends with people because I—not just like in grade school, but while growing up—I felt couldn&#8217;t be genuine because of this gender thing that I couldn’t tell anyone about. Plus, things I was interested in people around me didn&#8217;t care about. I was pretty shy and quiet. So for the shy person, the person who was quiet in the back of the room to get all this attention, all at once, was different. You can&#8217;t prepare for it.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I used to avoid eye contact at all costs thinking, &#8216;Please don&#8217;t look at me, please don&#8217;t look at me.&#8217; Now if I catch people staring at me I take my sunglasses off and stare them down. I shouldn&#8217;t have to feel bad about being me.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>You mentioned also that you are worried about calling yourself a woman in tech.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s not that I feel like I&#8217;m invading women&#8217;s spaces, but I&#8217;m afraid of being accused of that in women&#8217;s spaces, for the same reason that I&#8217;m a little scared of showing up to women in tech meetups or things in technology specifically for women because someone might try to throw it in my face and I just don&#8217;t want to have to deal with that. I get anxious in multiple-stall bathrooms. If there&#8217;s only gendered restrooms in a building and I might have to interact with someone while in there, it&#8217;s nerve wracking. I shouldn&#8217;t be worried about that and if someone makes that unpleasant for me it&#8217;s not my fault. But that doesn&#8217;t reduce the fear of it happening to me, that doesn&#8217;t make it any more pleasant. The fact that it&#8217;s not my fault is kind of irrelevant. I&#8217;m just scared of it. I have some friends who have been really good about bringing me to these things and trying to involve me more and the female coworkers I have have been nothing but welcoming and supportive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[NOTE—this interview took place before the recent rash of states trying to pass legislation keeping transfolk out of restrooms of the appropriate gender.]</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that I feel like I&#8217;m invading women&#8217;s spaces, but I&#8217;m afraid of being accused of that in women&#8217;s spaces, for the same reason that I&#8217;m a little scared of showing up to women in tech meetups or things in technology specifically for women because someone might try to throw it in my face and I just don&#8217;t want to have to deal with that.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Yeah, on the flip side you&#8217;re doing some really amazing work and working on really cool stuff—I don&#8217;t know how you can talk about that, but I’d like to hear what excites you about work and what are some of the rewarding things about your work.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is going to be a little difficult to talk about. I work on map related technology at Uber. Things that attempt to model the physical world and how we interact with it, how cars interact with it, how cars move around in it, things that try make predictions about those interactions. Specifically our routing engine, trying to predict travel times and paths. These predictions are used to inform a lot of intelligent business decisions. So, when I improve the accuracy of some of these predictions, or make them slightly more hardware efficient it enables so much. If I can make this prediction faster and more efficient then people can do more and plan further out and make better decisions. We’re talking about internal consumers, people who are internally using this. If I make them more accurate than we can—we can make better decisions. We can make more informed decisions, we can ask more questions if we are able to go faster.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I do work I know it&#8217;s reflected in the physical world. I know that something moved because of what I did, because of my ability to do my job well. That&#8217;s great. That&#8217;s awesome. That&#8217;s really satisfying.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, the things that I work on have a direct bearing on physical world. Our ability to predict these things, or our software’s ability to predicts these things influences what Uber pool match you get or what driver get dispatched to you. It’s reflected in the physical world, right? I flick bits and atoms move. That&#8217;s huge. The impact of my work is tangible. When I do things that make improvements on a per trip basis, times the number of trips we&#8217;re doing&#8230; To be able to say that we made that point one percent improvement across all trips, that adds up fast. And it&#8217;s not some really large number of eyeballs on an ad, or displays on a webpage, or better search results, or something like that. Those are also—people care about those things too, obviously. But </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I do work I know it&#8217;s reflected in the physical world. I know that something moved because of what I did, because of my ability to do my job well. That&#8217;s great. That&#8217;s awesome. That&#8217;s really satisfying.</span></p>\n<p><b>You haven&#8217;t been in Silicon Valley too long, but I&#8217;m curious to know if you still feel like you have to suppress feminine parts of yourself to fit in in tech? Does that make sense?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess this is a little bit difficult because how do you gender a behavior? It&#8217;s hard for me to identify individual behaviors that I have and say, &#8220;Oh, this is inherently feminine,&#8221; or, &#8220;Oh, this is inherently masculine.&#8221; The best I&#8217;ve got is I wear skirts every day. That&#8217;s probably feminine. We can safely say that&#8217;s pretty feminine, right?</span></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s a great point.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I do that no matter what. If anyone&#8217;s uncomfortable with it, they can deal with it. My hair is dyed, my skirts are long… My femininity is about how I make sense to myself, I don’t feel like I suppress my femininity at work or in tech or like there’s a need to.</span></p>\n<p><b>How has life changed for you positively now that you can be yourself?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m way happier. I was a pretty sad kid, even through college. I feel like my emotional state was generally not positive for various reasons. Coming out here and getting to be myself—not only to be myself but getting to live my own life—I got to choose my job. I get to choose what I do with my spare time. I don&#8217;t have these looming assignment deadlines left over from college. I feel like I—it&#8217;s not quite discovering myself, it&#8217;s more like building myself. I get to choose who I am, getting to pursue my own interests and do things that I want to do. Work or hobby or people I socialize with. That&#8217;s been incredibly rewarding. I&#8217;m happy with how my life is going. There are things I&#8217;d change, there are things I recognize about myself that I don&#8217;t fully like, that I would alter or improve in some way. That doesn&#8217;t mean I can’t like myself. I&#8217;m making progress in that direction. I&#8217;m getting to move there. I spend my time how I want. I&#8217;m learning to play piano. I love music, I’ve loved it as long as I can remember. I&#8217;ve never played it, but now I&#8217;ve found myself with discipline and personal time and resources to try to learn how to play instrument. I get to decide that’s something I want to do. If I want to spend my time making weird stuff like skirts that glow in the dark or feel like playing with LEDs or maybe some Thursday nights or Fridays night I just want to sit in my room and play games with friends, I don&#8217;t have to feel bad about that because I&#8217;m actually doing the things that I want to do. When I spend time idle, I don&#8217;t feel bad about what I&#8217;m not doing. Because most of what I want to do, I am doing. Some things are resource constrained. There&#8217;s some things I just straight up can&#8217;t afford to do, but I can work towards that.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I get to choose who I am, getting to pursue my own interests and do things that I want to do.

What drives you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think, this is really, really trite and cliche. But, I really would like to contribute to making the world in some way, some tangible way a better place. And I do get to define like the ways in which I want to better it. Maybe that means, I don&#8217;t think any American should be required to own a car in order to live their lives. Which is not true for most Americans. You talk to people in L.A or Miami, you need a car in order to have a job, and it owns you. If I can make progress towards that I can say. If I can try to like give people the ability to move around more freely or encourage things to become dense and more friendly to people not owning these burdensome expensive things. It&#8217;s one example but if I can find a way to make progress towards that, that&#8217;s satisfying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know people who just have a job to pay bills. If I didn’t need money, I&#8217;d probably still be doing this job which is a great feeling. I don&#8217;t know a lot of people that could say that. It&#8217;s not just my job. I can improve the world in small ways too. Maybe I think that there should be more music in the world. Maybe I think people should be more expressive. I can be more expressive. I can try to put some emotion into sound and try to make that more true in the world. I can try to be kind to people, be friendly, try to be genuine, make people feel comfortable being genuine around me, try to carry this through more of my interactions with people. Professionally I try to think about this in terms of the world at large. How can I make progress towards things that I think are important on at scale? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my personal life, a lot of it&#8217;s interacting with my immediate surroundings. I think people should feel comfortable being expressive, so I try to do that with myself. It would be nice if people could be genuine around each other and say what they mean. I try make friends who feel like they can do that, make me feel comfortable doing that, find small pieces of community that feel that way and feel like expressing yourself is not just powerful—it&#8217;s important. It&#8217;s not the best answer, but it is mine.</span></p>\n<p><b>I think it&#8217;s great, and I think it&#8217;s so rad that you are able to be doing so much of that so early in your career</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, both coworkers and friends outside of work who are a lot older than me will ask, &#8220;How old are you? You&#8217;re 24? What?!&#8221; People seem shocked.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t have everything figured out, no 20-something has it all together—but I do think I&#8217;ve at least got a good sense of what is important to me. Maybe I don&#8217;t have the best sense of how to act on that and how to make progress on that, and those are definitely things that I struggle with and I&#8217;m learning about as I go, but I at least do have a sense of what&#8217;s important to me.</span></p>\n<p><b>My last question for you would be: What advice would you give for folks going through similar struggles who are either in tech or hoping to get into tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is really hard. It&#8217;s difficult to generalize from your own experience. Like, I&#8217;m an engineer. I believe in having a lot of data and making decisions based on that, and really I&#8217;ve only got my one story. But being the person who you feel like you are, the person who you want to be cannot be that bad. And the people who don&#8217;t want that person, you don&#8217;t always have to deal with. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I understand the parent thing. I&#8217;m not out to my parents. And if you&#8217;re dependent on your parents, and you feel like you can&#8217;t tell them, that&#8217;s hard. I think you should not be ashamed of who you are who you want to be. And if you don&#8217;t feel like you can act on that right now, then try to make progress towards it, work towards putting yourself in a position where you can act like that. What that means for different people in different situations, there&#8217;s a million different answers to. But I think—yeah, I mean, it&#8217;s hard—I have no idea. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think it&#8217;s important to not be ashamed of who you want to be. And I think that&#8217;s the first step to caring for yourself. That&#8217;s also kind of cheesy, but it&#8217;s true, right? Like, if you care about yourself, you will put so much more effort into getting yourself into a better situation, getting yourself into a place where you can work on those things, where you can be the person you want to be. You shouldn&#8217;t be ashamed of feeling the way you feel and wanting to be who you want to be. I think that might really be the most important thing to recognize, that might be the thing that someone should’ve told me—I wish I&#8217;d heard that. Senior year of high school that would&#8217;ve been great to hear, just to know it, have it come from someone who really did know me and care for me. If you can put yourself in a position where you can care about yourself and you can like yourself it just changes the way you look at your situation. It&#8217;s no longer woe is me, and doom and gloom, and I deserve this, it becomes maybe I deserve better, maybe I can work towards that.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you care about yourself, you will put so much more effort into getting yourself into a better situation, getting yourself into a place where you can work on those things, where you can be the person you want to be.

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>So let&#8217;s start from the beginning. Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p>I was born in Hayward, California. I have been an East Bay resident for most of my life. I grew up between Hayward and Oakland, sort of bounced around a lot as a kid. From there, I was actually the first kid in my family—and I don&#8217;t know where I got the idea—that I wanted to go to college, but I just thought that that was what I was supposed to do.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I come from a pretty low socioeconomic background, a pretty poor community, and one that is pretty wrought with a lot of gang violence, a lot of drug abuse and in my home, specifically my sister, was a drug dealer for most of my life. I grew up in this really chaotic home and for me—I had a lot of examples of what I didn’t want to be, what I didn’t want out of life.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, unlike most of the people that I grew up around, I just felt like, &#8220;I need to go to college.&#8221; I eventually got into some schools  and somehow found some money to go.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I come from a pretty low socioeconomic background, a pretty poor community, and one that is pretty wrought with a lot of gang violence, a lot of drug abuse and in my home, specifically my sister, was a drug dealer for most of my life. I grew up in this really chaotic home and for me—I had a lot of examples of what I didn’t want to be, what I didn’t want out of life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would see these depictions of women on TV who were educated and independent, and they weren&#8217;t exposed to sexual assault, and abuse, and they weren&#8217;t exposed to drug abuse or trauma, or violence and I mean—maybe they were, actually—but on TV they looked so—happy. And I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;d like a calm life. I think that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;d like. I&#8217;d like to be successful.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t know where my ambition actually came from, but at some point I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go to college.&#8221; I worked my ass off in high school and tried to take advantage of what little resources I had to make it work. I eventually got one of my mom’s old friends to co-sign on some student loans to cover what my scholarships didn’t cover. And I went to college. The first person in my family to do it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I attended a few different colleges and eventually wound up in San Francisco at USF. They gave me some money to go to school there and I actually, by total accidental, wound up in the technology industry during my time at USF.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would see these depictions of women on TV who were educated and independent, and they weren&#8217;t exposed to sexual assault, and abuse, and they weren&#8217;t exposed to drug abuse or trauma, or violence and I mean—maybe they were, actually—but on TV they looked so—happy.

I&#8217;d like to be successful.'&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><b>What was the impetus that got you interested in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s the official story of how I got into tech: My best friend at the time, who&#8217;s actually still my best friend today, Kacie, was working at our Career Services Center and I needed a job pretty badly. I was very poor. At the time, I wasn&#8217;t speaking to my family at all. My parents have no money. They have horrible credit. They could never really help themselves and so they could definitely never help me. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I remember at the time I was stealing tampons from my campus bathroom because I just didn&#8217;t have the $5 to spend on tampons. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And just looking back—still, looking back on that past still affects me in so many ways.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I remember at the time I was stealing tampons from my campus bathroom because I just didn&#8217;t have the $5 to spend on tampons.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But yeah—back to the story of getting into tech. So, I was really poor and I was like, &#8220;Okay. I have my student loans and my scholarships paying for my housing and my tuition.&#8221; But I didn&#8217;t really any have money to eat or for any basic shit like paying for household items, groceries, or whatever. So Kacie, who was also my roommate at the time, comes from really a similar background as me. We both had to work really hard and live really simply. We grew up living paycheck to paycheck. Neither of us had any sort of safety net and we always just had to make it work. So, when she was working at the Career Services Center, she would bring me home job ads.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of them was from a startup in Soma and I was like, computers, hmmm I can computer. I can figure it out. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I always had this blind faith in myself. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s arrogance, I don&#8217;t know what it is or where it came from. I don&#8217;t know why me. Why I always figured I could make it work. I knew that I knew how to learn. I knew how to teach myself things. So I figured, if I put myself in this atmosphere, maybe I can learn a few things.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I would apply to all of these job ads that Kacie would bring home. And one of these ads was from a startup named Yammer. At the time, they were a really small tech company who has just moved up from LA. They had placed an ad for a really lowly data entry position. It was a temp job for sure, but I was like, “no I think I’ll stay.” I was a very stubborn person. I&#8217;m sure the reality of me finding a job at Yammer has something to do with my white-passing privilege, I’m sure. But I kind of just threw my hand up for all the odd jobs around the office.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I always had this blind faith in myself.

I knew how to teach myself things. So I figured, if I put myself in this atmosphere, maybe I can learn a few things.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Someone would be like “We need someone to stack the fridge. I&#8217;d be like, ‘Me!’” “We need someone to write a blurb for our blog,” ‘Me!’” “We need someone to replace all of the hyperlinks links in our blog templates” and I was like “Me!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All these menial tasks sort of allowed me to build a skill set around being a creative technologist. I mean I had some background. I wrote and I read so much when I was younger because I experienced so much trauma as a kid, and reading and writing and escaping my world and being in this other like fiction-y world, really provided a safe space for me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it came to reading, specifically, I think it kind of saved my life. It got me through some really hard times and provided a kind of shelter for me through much of my adolescence. I think I feel really similarly about the internet, actually. On the Internet, I can be a person who isn’t wounded by my past—although now, I guess, I might seen as wounded online, heh.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the Internet has always felt like magic to me. It&#8217;s this thing that anyone—even people like us that come from a pretty low socio-economic background—can access these tools to teach ourselves things, and to interact on the same playing field. I can meet or talk to someone from anywhere in the world, and I can connect with someone and find those people who are like me, and have experienced similar things to me, I guess. There&#8217;s something really magical about it all.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;But the Internet has always felt like magic to me.

There&#8217;s something really magical about it all.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, anyway, I decided to stick around in tech. To do Internet things.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I taught myself to code long before I think I would have considered myself a designer, but I eventually realized that I find a lot more satisfaction in design work, and in bringing a vision, a product, to life. And now I get to do this type of work on a daily basis. That&#8217;s how I came into this crazy world that is tech.</span></p>\n<p><b>What your first impressions were of Silicon Valley, whenever you happened to discover it?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was just really attracted to the edginess of it. I was really attracted to this faux ideology of “meritocracy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There really is this &#8220;Oh, you dropped out of high school. You can be a CTO,&#8221; sort of thing. To me, that was really attractive, the mobility. Here I thought, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be working as an admin, or a secretary my whole life,&#8221; because that&#8217;s what women who come from my community wind up doing. Or maybe I would have ended up in a warehouse. There&#8217;s not a lot of mobility in these types of jobs. Whereas at these startups, I was seeing these men who’d dropped out of high school running companies. And so I was like—again, this stubbornness comes up for me, I was like, &#8220;If they can do it, I can do it.&#8221; Well, I don&#8217;t know that I ever really believed that. I think that for me, I felt like I had to do it. I felt like if I didn’t do it, I would die. I don&#8217;t how to describe it—</span></p>\n<p><b>I literally can relate.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like, you feel like you don&#8217;t have the option to fail. There&#8217;s no choice. And so you better make it, and then you better turn around and give back to whoever it is around you that you can, because—I don&#8217;t know. Like thinking that you did it all on your own is sort of a privilege in it&#8217;s own right—I don&#8217;t know. Sorry [laughter]. It&#8217;s  really hard for me to talk about sometimes. But, yeah, it just really felt like I had to make it and so, I guess, by any objective standard in our industry I feel like I&#8217;ve succeeded, which is awesome.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m still sort of learning—I&#8217;m still sort of career building and I have so much growing to do, but I think that I&#8217;ve sort of gotten past the whole “I don&#8217;t belong here” thing because not even the people who think they belong here belong here, you know?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like I feel like the Internet belongs to all of us even though businesses don&#8217;t operate that way. I don’t know, I just feel more empowered these days than I did when I first joined tech.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So on the one hand, I was really attracted to the mobility in tech, when I joined, and the opportunity and the access. But what I was really taken back by was the wealth and how wasteful people are with it—specifically in Silicon Valley.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I remember the first time I started dating someone in tech and I was still in college and poor as fuck at this point. He was like “I’ll take you to your favorite sushi place, your choice!” So I had this place that I always went to in college and I loved it. It was super cheap (by SF standards) and super delicious and I was all about that fucking place. I thought it was like top notch because to me those things matter, a lot. If I have a good time there with my friends, then that&#8217;s the top notch place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So this guy, we go on a date at this sushi place and he starts the conversation by doing this thing that really bothers me. Salaries came up or money or something. I don&#8217;t remember exactly how the subject of money came up, but it did. And he was like, &#8220;Oh. I can&#8217;t possibly tell you how much I make.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yeah, you can.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;It&#8217;s fine.&#8221; But he did that fake embarrassed thing—like, he wasn’t really embarrassed. He&#8217;s really proud and he wants to talk about it. There&#8217;s this great SNL skit that&#8217;s like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t make me dance.&#8221; It&#8217;s when someone who really, actually, does want to talk about it, trying to get you to probe them, I guess, for more information and to me, that was really off-putting. So that was annoying. I’m a real ass bitch. I always speak my mind and I don’t feign embarrassment or shyness and I guess I wasn’t used to being who did.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then, the absolute worst part of this date happened. When the bill came, he laughed at it. He audibly laughed at the check and just—I think my head just went to the side like, &#8220;Wowwww.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had never been in an environment like that. I was coming from a totally different world. I never thought that I would make more than my mother made. My mom worked for the court system in Alameda County for 35 years and her ending salary, after 35 years of service to the county, was $50K. This guy—who eventually told me his salary—shocking, I know. He was getting paid $125K, which now I make much more than. But I don&#8217;t act like that, I would never act like that. it&#8217;s insane to me. It&#8217;s insane how much wealth there is here but also how quickly it can go away.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What else is insane to me is how wide of a gap there is between the salaries  a “junior” or a “non-technical” employee and those of engineers and designers. It’s pretty astounding. And so to see someone act that way—in a restaurant—I was embarrassed and angry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was embarrassed because of what I come from and—I don&#8217;t know. Like—I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s just like, I assumed &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s just this person. This person is just this way.&#8221; But then I started realizing that this is a really common attitude and set of behaviors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once when I was out for a dinner with coworkers, no special occasion, and I watched my founder get wasted at Alexander Steak House and tip 50% on top of the included gratuity on a bill for like 14 people’s dinners. Great for the waitress. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, my god, that&#8217;s amazing.&#8221; Like, “You&#8217;re going to have a great night and a great month probably.&#8221; But just how nominal it was to them. Like to do that. Like how easy it was, and how much it didn&#8217;t affect them. I was like, &#8220;I could feed my family for like how long on that tip, not even the bill.&#8221; So it was just kind of insane to watch. That was like a $20,000 dinner or something crazy like that.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’ve always felt like I have to hide the person I am from everyone. I am always worried that someone&#8217;s going to “find me out,” and that I will be no longer welcomed, or I will be no longer valued as a person here, and I&#8217;m still working through that.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>I remember seeing people throw money around like that in my early years in tech and just thinking, &#8220;God, if they only knew how much $500 would change my life.&#8221;</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And you feel this shame for even thinking this. It&#8217;s hard to ask for help. It&#8217;s super hard, and you don&#8217;t want to be—because I know how rich people see poor people—as needy, and that we&#8217;re always asking for handouts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is actually a conversation that came up in a college course when I was at USF, where there’s a ton of wealthy students. We were discussing the history of San Francisco and speculating  about why specific immigrant populations settled in different neighborhoods of the city and the conversation very quickly devolved into students railing against poor and ethnic people. The line, &#8220;Well, white people are richer because they work harder,&#8221; was actually said. In a college class. And then—What was the other one? “White people don&#8217;t want to live next to ethnic people, because ethnic people are always asking white people for money.” I was horrified.</span></p>\n<p><b>Holy shit. On what planet?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On theirs, apparently. That was a really big &#8220;Holy shit, these people are not like me&#8221; moment and I had to settle into that feeling because that attitude was pretty well represented the people I was meeting in tech.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s always been really disheartening for me and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve always felt like I have to hide the person I am from everyone. I am always worried that someone&#8217;s going to “find me out,” and that I will be no longer welcomed, or I will be no longer valued as a person here, and I&#8217;m still working through that.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a lot of survivor guilt about my family and friends being left behind. All my friends who I think are just as creative and just as smart as any of these tech people and they just don’t have the same access to the tools and the resources as them. I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s sad. It&#8217;s sad and it&#8217;s hard to reconcile</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I go to therapy twice a week for this [chuckles], but it&#8217;s just survivor guilt that I have from making it out of the hood, and making it in a really white, male-dominated industry. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a lot of survivor guilt about my family and friends being left behind. All my friends who I think are just as creative and just as smart as any of these tech people and they just don’t have the same access to the tools and the resources as them. I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s sad. It&#8217;s sad and it&#8217;s hard to reconcile</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It certainly doesn&#8217;t make me want to participate in a lot of tech-focused things, because my mind and my heart will always be with my friends and family whose lives are more complicated and who have been through it with me. I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s hard not to be resentful to some extent as well. It&#8217;s hard to make peace with the disparity, I guess. It&#8217;s always on my mind.</span></p>\n<p><b>Okay, so before I go deeper into the dark shit, tell me in terms of your work, just overall, what have been some of the most exciting things about your work? What parts of your work really activate you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, my god, so many parts. All the parts. No, I&#8217;m kidding. I have one story that I like to tell, because it just totally simplifies why I am still here—I had been doing these odd jobs, just trying to infiltrate this boys&#8217; club, and say, &#8220;No, I can be technical, too. I can understand technology, and I can be an expert.&#8221; I was actually on the marketing team at Yammer when the perfect opportunity to level-up presented itself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We had our own visual design team in the marketing group and we really wanted to build a static page that acted as a feature overview for a new product launch we were doing at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">None of the product engineers wanted to build it, because they were like, &#8220;No, we came here to work on the product, not marketing.” Marketing doesn&#8217;t get a ton of cred with engineers. If they’re smart, they realize the value that marketing can have, but unfortunately the reality within most tech startups is that marketing is just fluff.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, I remember.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Come on. We&#8217;re all here to run a business, guys.&#8221; But, yeah, so I was in this meeting when we were like, &#8220;Wow, it would be really nice if we had this webpage.” So, once again, I threw my hand up and said “I&#8217;ll do it.'&#8221; And I thought, &#8220;I can figure it out. I&#8217;ve written some HTML before. It can&#8217;t be that hard, right?&#8221; I had no idea what I was getting myself into, honestly.</span></p>\n<p>I pulled some pretty late nights, but with the luck of a lot of Googling around I was able to pull together what our design team wanted, and we wound up launching this page at TechCrunch Disrupt. Which, in turn, meant we got a ton of traffic to this page that I’d built.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After we launched, one of our engineers pulled me over and he was looking at this data visualization tool that was showing all of the visitors and http requests we were getting to this page and how we were distributing the traffic and requests across load balancers. There were these little circles—and I&#8217;ll never fucking forget these little circles because they’re what really attracted me to information design.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>These salaries that we get paid, not only are they great for our bank accounts—but for some of us, the kind of money one can earn in tech can really transform your life. You can lift your whole family out of poverty one day with the type of salaries we earn. It’s tremendously powerful for someone like me. I just think it&#8217;s—being able to do that, have this amazing power to improve your own life, and your own situation, and your own health, and eat good food.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They were flowing onto the screen and into a funnel, and like—It&#8217;s almost like a Rube Goldberg machine—they were being diverted into different paths. It was so fucking cool. I remember seeing that and thinking &#8220;All these little bubbles are people and they&#8217;re looking at this thing that I made,&#8221; and there&#8217;s just something so powerful in that for me. Being a maker is so powerful. It&#8217;s this—It&#8217;s a freedom, and something that I could take pride in, and something that I can point to and say, &#8220;I did that,&#8221; or &#8220;Me and my team did that.”. Being a part of that launch meant so much to me. I think that&#8217;s where I get a lot of my self-esteem and a lot of my self-worth—putting out things that people use and that people love, and that people talk about. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s the coolest part. I remember we went on Twitter—and this is really early Twitter days —for me at least—and we could see what people were saying about the site.  They really liked the page and I was like, &#8220;Wow, I wrote that.&#8221; It was just really, really awesome and—I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ll just never forget that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think this was the first time that I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to do this as a job,&#8221; and I can make money doing it, and really improve my own circumstances—People don&#8217;t realize that. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These salaries that we get paid, not only are they great for our bank accounts—but for some of us, the kind of money one can earn in tech can really transform your life. You can lift your whole family out of poverty one day with the type of salaries we earn. It’s tremendously powerful for someone like me. I just think it&#8217;s—being able to do that, have this amazing power to improve your own life, and your own situation, and your own health, and eat good food.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;People don&#8217;t realize that when someone threatens your ability to work—and you&#8217;re someone like me—that&#8217;s your everything. That&#8217;s your livelihood.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The thing that makes me feel like I have really made it, really is a fridge full of groceries, good groceries. And I&#8217;m eating well, not like a glutton or anything., But I can afford to eat well now. Healthily. And I can cook good meals and really take care of my body. Like, I&#8217;m on probiotics now. I wouldn&#8217;t know what a probiotic was five years ago.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s really life-changing. And I don&#8217;t think a lot of people realize the stability and the quality of life we’re keeping away from those who really need these things by building an industry with a high barrier to entry, and one that isn’t inclusive. This seems so wrong to me. Why wouldn&#8217;t we try our best to open up the industry to more people? I don&#8217;t know.</span></p>\n<p><b>Did you, at any point, ever expect to be a face of gender rights and advocacy in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Am I? That&#8217;s weird. It&#8217;s so weird still, because I don&#8217;t feel that way. My friends just treat me so normally and I feel so normal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s so surreal to me, honestly. Back when I went public with my experiences at GitHub I just felt like I had to do it. It was one of those moments where I was like, &#8220;I have no other choice. I am backed into a corner.&#8221; And you probably notice as well, your flight or fight is triggered in that moment and you have to decide. And, trust me, I think that I might have looked, in that moment, strong and eloquent on Twitter, but one of my best friends had to come and pick me up off of a hotel room floor because I was crying hysterically and I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I was like, &#8220;There&#8217;s no point in living anymore.&#8221;</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t imagine wanting to hurt someone, actually. So the fact that people really wanted to hurt me, not just professionally, but also physically, and emotionally they wanted to end me. I don&#8217;t know. It was so devastating. It was so devastating. I think people in tech like to try to distance themselves from what happens on the internet and be think, &#8220;Tech workers are normals. It&#8217;s just people on the internet who are crazy, just these randos who live in basements and wherever.&#8221; It&#8217;s like, no. These people work side-by-side with us in these offices. They&#8217;re not randos.

But hey, I&#8217;m still here.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I never imagined I would be the face of anything, nor have I ever wanted to be. I’m naturally very protective of people who can&#8217;t for whatever reason, protect themselves. Having grown up in a really abusive and violent home, I always wished that I had someone to protect me. As an adult, I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time and a lot of, sometimes to my own detriment, setting myself on fire to keep other people warm. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s always the most intelligent thing to do, but for at least my early twenties, I really felt like it was my responsibility. I really felt like, &#8220;Hey, I have access to these things, and all these girls, all these women of color who are at home or from Hayward, I want to show them that they can be here, and they deserve to be here, and they have every right to be here, just as much as anyone else does.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They have everything they need, inside of them. They have all the parts. They just need access. I guess I just always really felt really, deeply responsible for—I don&#8217;t know. To create something. To create an industry that is better than the one we came into.</span></p>\n<p><b>Man. There&#8217;s so much more context and depth to the risk you took now that I know more about your upbringing. I was such a minimizer the whole time I was in tech because if you don’t have a safety net and you do anything to lose the job, that&#8217;s it.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. And it doesn&#8217;t go away, honestly. And I understand that not every woman has the opportunity to do what I did. They don&#8217;t. I already had a pretty good network. I knew that I could find a job and that I would hustle and find a new job. I don&#8217;t think everyone has that. I know that there are people, especially women, and even more so, women of color, who have suffered much greater mistreatment than I have but who are much less protected than I am. So for them, ”speaking out” would be even more costly.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard when you see all these companies pouring money into diversity efforts, but you still hear all these stories of these women who are being seriously mistreated, sexually assaulted, just brutalized at the hands of incompetent management in tech and having their hope stripped away.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Thinking about the barriers that we all face, I want to know more about that. I would venture to guess that a lot of women reached out to you after the fact with stories, and you don&#8217;t have to get super specific, but I&#8217;m just curious what you learned through other women about the greater woman-in-tech experience after that incident?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly, it was really hard for me to hear a lot of stories. In one sense, I was very happy to be a person that someone felt safe enough to talk to and to reach out to, and I felt so much love and warmth from that. I feel like a lot of those stories gave me strength, and I built a sisterhood with a lot of these women. And at the same time, for my own mental health, it was devastating. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s hard when you see all these companies pouring money into diversity efforts, but you still hear all these stories of these women who are being seriously mistreated, sexually assaulted, just brutalized at the hands of incompetent management in tech and having their hope stripped away.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Because what this does, it&#8217;s generational. When women have had to put up with this for generations and then the new generation of women come in  and they don&#8217;t get treated the way that the first generation did. I almost feel like there&#8217;s some resentment there, where it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Everyone should have to go through what I went through,&#8221; which I am like, &#8220;Hell no, protect other women. At. All. Costs.&#8221;</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;What&#8217;s really cool for me is to watch other women stand up for themselves and to tell me that I inspired that—their strength. And I am not worthy of that. But that&#8217;s worth it to me. Oh, my god, like I would go through it—maybe not a million times—I&#8217;d go through it at least two more times if I could know that people could look at me and see that I&#8217;m okay and know that they&#8217;re going to be okay, too. It&#8217;s really important for me to stick around for this reason, and to not let other people silence me because when I get silenced so does a whole generation of women who come after me.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, actually, I don&#8217;t even think the kids will need our protection. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What&#8217;s really cool for me is to watch other women stand up for themselves and to tell me that I inspired that—their strength.

I&#8217;m still having to remind myself that this isn&#8217;t natural. No one should ever tweet your home address, tell you that they&#8217;re going to rape you and your whole family. That&#8217;s not normal, and I think that our culture is normalizing that behavior and writing it off as though, &#8220;That person’s crazy, but whatever.&#8221; But it&#8217;s not normal and it doesn&#8217;t make it okay, regardless of whoever the person on the other end is. It&#8217;s not okay. And It&#8217;s not our fault.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think as women it&#8217;s so ingrained in us to internalize any abuse that we receive and to process it as if, &#8216;We must have done something to deserve this.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I&#8217;m still sort of in this—I wouldn&#8217;t call it healing, because I hate when people tell me I need to heal. As important as healing is, I think that everyone should kind of heal on their own terms, and not be told to heal by other people. It&#8217;s sort of passive-aggressive in a way [chuckles]. But I&#8217;m still in the stage of convincing myself on a daily basis that I did not deserve this. And it&#8217;s hard, it&#8217;s really hard. I think that might be easier for someone who didn&#8217;t come from the background I come from. But I&#8217;ve internalized abuse my entire life. So this is a long journey for me, and I think I&#8217;m at the point where I&#8217;ve accepted that it might take my whole life to learn how to cope. But I&#8217;m making peace with that, the fact that I came from this background. It was out of my control as a child. It was somewhat at least power-dynamic-wise, out of my control at GitHub and in tech, when I was not in a position of power.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m just still very much in the process of learning how to take care of myself. I&#8217;m trying to not set myself on fire to keep other people warm, anymore. It&#8217;s not my job. That&#8217;s something that all women need to hear at some point. They need to hear that self care is important, and self worth is important, and working on themselves, and spending time with themselves, and celebrating themselves is important.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> All those things are just so fundamental, at least for me, in finding happiness and stability. As someone who comes from a very unstable background, my goal has always been stability. That&#8217;s where I&#8217;m at.</span></p>\n<p><b>My next question touches a little bit on what you were just saying. What do you think your motivators are?  What do you think drives you and has that changed from a few years ago?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I used to be really ambitious. I used to be like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be a CEO,&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8217;m going to start a company,&#8221; and I think that my motivation has changed. Now I just want to be okay, and to be healthy, and to be stable, and I know that life is chaos. I&#8217;ve kind of accepted that, but I think now—I think I&#8217;m less ambitious in the traditional sense, and more ambitious in being at peace with my past, where I come from, and this survivor&#8217;s guilt thing that I experience a lot.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’m just still very much in the process of learning how to take care of myself.

I&#8217;m doing a lot of unpacking because I think as a means of survival, you are taught to suppress all of your bad experiences, and just say to yourself, &#8220;It&#8217;s fine. It&#8217;s fine. It&#8217;s fine.&#8221; I&#8217;m minimizing, as you called it earlier, which I think is a really good way to put it. You have to do that to survive sometimes. And I think now, for the first time in my life, I&#8217;m surrounded by positive people. I have built this amazing team of friends and family members around me. I have an awesome therapist. I am sort of spending some time unpacking why I am the way I am. Why I react to things in certain ways. Why I&#8217;m triggered by certain behaviors in others, etc. And I&#8217;m just kind of focusing on myself, which is why I&#8217;m not doing any speaking or writing right now—like, I&#8217;m not doing any interviews; I&#8217;m not reading a single blog post this year. I&#8217;m not doing anything I don&#8217;t want to do, basically. I barely even drink anymore. I&#8217;m just trying to do things that make me feel good, and I&#8217;m trying to take care of myself because I think for a long time a part of why I was so ambitious was because so long as I was focused so much on my work and my advocacy, I didn&#8217;t have to deal with my past. I thought that if I just focused on work, and I became—I think in some ways that benefited me, because I obviously became well known in my craft and respected and valued as an employee, or as a producer, whatever it is. A producer of value—a worker. But I think that there&#8217;s just so much more to me and my life  and I’m just starting to try to embrace some more of those things recently.</span></p>\n<p><b>What do you look for in a job now versus when you started? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, well, mobility used to be a really big thing for me and so I would pretty much go anywhere—I mean, I think that there is this thing where you&#8217;re young you want to work for like the hot, flashy start up, right? You want your personal brand associated with this really hot, edgy—I don&#8217;t know—brand of this larger entity or whatever. I don&#8217;t go for that anymore. I want to do really great collaborative work. I think also I used to be very much like—because you go into so many tight companies and you think fighting is normal and we should always fight about the things and argue and be really like—I love the passion that comes out in that in some like technical—arguments—But I&#8217;m not in it to be the winner.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in it to do work that I&#8217;m really proud of, because those are the times I look back at my career and think, &#8220;Damn, that was great.&#8221; The times that I felt most proud of the work I was doing was when it was on a team that was super collaborative and one where everyone was contributing. I don’t get there when I’m working alone.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m not in it to win an argument, I&#8217;m not in it to “win” a company, I&#8217;m not in it to win a stock option that&#8217;s not worth anything [chuckles]. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m in it to do work that I&#8217;m really proud of, because those are the times I look back at my career and think, &#8220;Damn, that was great.&#8221; The times that I felt most proud of the work I was doing was when it was on a team that was super collaborative and one where everyone was contributing.

It&#8217;s nice to be on a team where other people know what it&#8217;s like to be constantly discriminated against, and judged for who they are in this industry, or what they represent, or where they come from.

You could work for the best company in the world, but if you have a bad manager I just feel like your experience at that company is not going to be one that&#8217;s positive; it&#8217;s not going to be one that helps you grow as an individual contributor or a manager. Again, I grew up having enough bad examples of what not to do in my life and so these days I&#8217;m sort of looking for more good examples and for what I want to do with my career. I&#8217;m finally at a company where I can have a long career. I could realistically stay at my company until I retire and that&#8217;s a really exciting thing to me. It gives me so much motivation to want to work on my relationships with people and build with them. Those relationships don’t feel contentious like so many really high pressure start-up roles feel. I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m competing with anyone on my team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m reading this awesome comic book series right now called Saga and I&#8217;m obsessed with it and there are so many really good quotes in it—but there’s one in particular really resonates with me and that’s, &#8220;life is mostly about learning how to lose&#8221;.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Life isn’t so much about our winning moments but it really is about how we handle losing. What’s our next move? How do we keep going?  People like us, we&#8217;ve been losing forever, right? So this isn&#8217;t anything new. For some more privileged people I think it&#8217;s a lot harder to lose, especially later in life because they&#8217;ve never done it before.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do your friends and family from home feel about how far you&#8217;ve come?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My best friend Kacie is an elementary school teacher and she actually uses me as her example of how to “make it.” She works at a public elementary school in Oakland and her school has one of the highest rates of children who have experienced trauma. I was one of those kids. They’re me. I go to her school and I see these kids and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I remember running on the playground with all of you&#8221;. It&#8217;s really a cool experience for me. But they&#8217;re going through a lot as kids and it&#8217;s cool because I&#8217;ll come around and she&#8217;s using me in her lesson plans to teach her students that just because you might not come from the most fortunate situation, you don’t have to accept that that’s all you deserve out of life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think every kid deserves a childhood.

If I didn’t have my background, I probably would have just swept all that emotion and pain under the rug and kept going, you know, as so many women have to do. I think my past has influenced almost everything about me. Almost everything. Yeah. And I think, again, even though I&#8217;m trying really hard to focus on myself, I still think deep down that I am fairly protective of other people and their right to live and be who they are and bring who they are to work, and I just think I do it in a very different way than I did in the beginning of my career.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. Shall we go macro for a second?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? What excites you, what frustrates you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women are in such a difficult position when they join a tech company, and I&#8217;m not speaking for myself personally. I&#8217;ve been in this position at many companies. I feel like tech companies expect women to be their voices of “diversity.” And I feel like there&#8217;s a ton of pressure put on women to recruit other women to their tech firms. But then if something bad happens you&#8217;re almost made to feel like a hypocrite. Being in this position really makes you question yourself and if you’re merely a part of the machine, instead of someone who is creating real change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I&#8217;m excited about is just the rise of all these just incredible voices of women in tech. I have a mentee who is a CS student at Berkeley. She comes from Hayward. I coached her in cross country when she was 14 years old at my high school. I coached my own cross country team for a summer in college and it is so fucking cool to see her bring her Hayward swag to such a white, cultureless industry. It&#8217;s just so rad because I never had the balls. I never had the balls to be 100% who I am inside of these establishments and I feel her bringing it. And I feel like I helped a little bit which is really gratifying.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I see this mosaic sort of taking shape in tech now, and I’m seeing all these different voices emerge and there no longer being one woman as an authority over the voice of women in tech. And I love that. I am obsessed with that. I am so excited. I get to take a step back and really just admire it and help sort of signal boost. Like, there&#8217;s just so many amazing women doing very cool things in our industry right now—it&#8217;s very cool.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s all about creating space. There&#8217;s more space in tech in 2016  for her to be herself, then there was for me when I joined the industry. Just seeing her be like, &#8220;I&#8217;m here and I’m just as good,&#8221; seeing her have the attitude of, &#8220;I deserve to be here and I’m just as good as any of you,&#8221; is such a powerful thing for me and I really hadn&#8217;t seen that in at least my first four or five years in tech. That&#8217;s something I&#8217;m super excited about. There&#8217;s way more vocal women now so it&#8217;s no longer like the one Julie or the one Shanley, you know what I mean? It&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s one radical feminist, no. They&#8217;re everywhere and there&#8217;s all these voices. For me, and I&#8217;ve said this in the past and no one&#8217;s ever written about it which makes me always like—you know when you say something in an interview and then they never write about it and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;That was the gold. That&#8217;s what I want people to cover.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><b>I got you girl. Don&#8217;t worry.</b></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always felt like there&#8217;s no one woman in tech, like it&#8217;s not Julie. I&#8217;m only one person. I&#8217;m only one woman in tech. I&#8217;ve always felt like the Women in Tech movement should be represented by this mosaic essentially of all these different voices and all these different experiences</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It should be representative of different ethnicities and cultures and I want the world that I know to be represented here, and the world I come from is really diverse. Where I come from everyone respects each other&#8217;s cultures and everyone respects the strength of women. It’s not devoid of its own brands of misogyny and prejudice. But it’s more representative of what the world is actually like.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyways, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I see this mosaic sort of taking shape in tech now, and I’m seeing all these different voices emerge and there no longer being one woman as an authority over the voice of women in tech. And I love that. I am obsessed with that. I am so excited. I get to take a step back and really just admire it and help sort of signal boost. Like, there&#8217;s just so many amazing women doing very cool things in our industry right now—it&#8217;s very cool.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the idea that I may have helped create some of this newfound space for women to shine is really cool too. It really is.</span></p>\n<p><b>I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any “may” about it.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am still not quite at the point of acceptance. My boyfriend tells me all the time, but I am just not quite there. I&#8217;m working on it, though, with my therapist—don&#8217;t worry [laughter].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m getting there. For a long time after my (very public) GitHub exit, I really felt like I had been abandoned. I felt like I had been kicked out of tech, and that I was like this taboo, like the black mark essentially—from Harry Potter. I now think a lot of that was internalized and it was just sort of in my own head. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it&#8217;s just really good not to feel like the enemy anymore, and to feel like there&#8217;s more of us than there are of the bad guys, maybe. I don&#8217;t know. Good and bad is like a weird binary for that, but there&#8217;s more introspection; there&#8217;s more conversation; there&#8217;s more dialogue. And I feel like those are the things that have to happen. Like, we all have to have hard conversations; we all have to check our privilege. Like, I accept that the way that I was treated by the press and by the media—those are the same thing, I guess, right—was probably way more kind than a woman who is visibly of color would have been treated, and I accept that there&#8217;s some privilege there, and so I think it&#8217;s important for all of us to sort of accept what privilege we have both in society and in the industry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The introspection that I am starting to see is really promising. There&#8217;s all these amazing women writers writing great pieces, and I just feel like I can retire. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;This is fantastic.” I just try to support them now and reach out when I feel like someone&#8217;s not in a good place and just let them know, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m here. You want to come and hang out with me and my dog? I&#8217;m around.&#8221; I try to do that as much as possible when I see someone on the receiving end of any abuse that I&#8217;ve experienced. It’s a messed up little sorority we&#8217;ve got going but [chuckles] I&#8217;m definitely feeling a little more solidarity and I&#8217;m feeling more—It&#8217;s just a feel. It&#8217;s so weird because you can point people to all these articles about women in tech in the past decade or so, but it&#8217;s really hard to capture how being in tech has felt over that time. There&#8217;s no exact timeline, really. But I&#8217;m definitely feeling way more positive about it now than I ever have.</span></p>\n<p><b>Amazing. I hate that you went through all that but I&#8217;m also so, so happy to see it all turning into such a positive thing.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s really cool. I don&#8217;t know. I just hope someday my kids will—Actually, there&#8217;s is a great story I&#8217;ll tell you—My grandma, my abuela, on my dad&#8217;s side, she was this total badass and she died a year after I was born and so I&#8217;ve only heard stories about her. But she was such a badass. One of the stories my tia told me was that when my abuela was young and in high school,  she had these red pumps, red high heels. She went to a Catholic school, an all-girls Catholic school, and they had to wear a uniform and she was like, &#8220;Nope.&#8221; She would hide these red Kat Von D-style pumps outside her house and she would leave dressed in her uniform every day. And then pull her pumps out of the bushes and dress herself up on the way to school and then get in trouble for it. I hear these little stories about her every once in a while and I really wish I had gotten to know her. But I still feel this deep connection to her, because of these stories. People say we look alike and we sing alike. There&#8217;s all these similarities and I just hope that someday my kids and my grandkids can read about me on the internet and be like, &#8220;Holy shit. Our abuela did cool shit.” I want to inspire them to open the door for more people like them. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve ever wanted to do, was open a door.</span></p>\n<p><b>My favorite coping mechanism that I&#8217;ve had since I was like 18 is &#8220;it&#8217;s good for the memoir.&#8221; </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s it.That&#8217;s a good one. That&#8217;s really good. I&#8217;m going to write that down.</span></p>\n<p><b>Like when the shittiest stuff happens I’m just like, &#8220;Noted, noted. This will fit in. This is pretty good. Yep. Here&#8217;s another chapter. Okay.” I would recommend. A very good coping mechanism.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s definitely going in the toolbox, for sure.</span></p>\n<p><b>Last question for you would be what advice would you have, just based on the lessons you&#8217;ve learned, for young girls who are either getting their start in tech or are hoping to get into it?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find your own way. That would probably be my advice. Find your own way and you don&#8217;t have to go to an Ivy League. You don&#8217;t have to rub shoulders with whoever, rub elbows, I don&#8217;t know the saying. Find your own way if you can. I would say </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">be 100% yourself because that is who you have to go home and live with. That&#8217;s who you have wake up with and look at in the mirror every day.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Be 100% yourself because that is who you have to go home and live with. That&#8217;s who you have wake up with and look at in the mirror every day.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of people will ask me, &#8220;Are you mad that GitHub didn&#8217;t fire so and so and that they&#8217;re not suffering or whatever?&#8221; I&#8217;m just like, &#8221; No, because they have to go to bed with who they are every night, and I get to go to bed knowing that my conscience is clear, and that I did everything that I could for myself and for other people in this situation. And that I did it with a pure heart.”  I don&#8217;t know. I did it with the best intentions, and I fought. I&#8217;ve had some really dark moments since then and dealing with the trauma from the experience has been challenging.  I ended up in a hospital once, and it is the biggest success to me that I survived, and that I&#8217;m a survivor. This stuff never going to go away for me. It&#8217;s going to be my whole life. It&#8217;s going to be a part of my story. A part of my memoir [chuckles]. I&#8217;m making peace with it, but also, I&#8217;m just making decisions and making choices that I can live with. That’s what I would recommend to young people is to make decisions and choices that&#8217;ll make you proud. Make yourself proud.</span></p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I come from North Carolina. I grew up in a small town, Teachey, North Carolina, about 45 minutes from Wilmington, NC. Population: 200. I grew up doing a lot of farming, working the fields, tobacco cropping and things of that nature. But I had a passion for art and drawing. I was an artist. I used to draw on classmates clothes. I used to do paintings. Initially, I got into computer graphic design.</span></p>\n<p><b>So you were a creative kid growing up. I&#8217;m impressed that you found that so early. I&#8217;m from New Bern, so I know what it&#8217;s like growing up in a tiny North Carolina town. I had no exposure to the word “creativity” until I moved to Raleigh.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wow!</span></p>\n<p><b>What was it like being a creative kid in the small-town South?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was fun. I can&#8217;t remember what drew me to art and drawing, but it was something I just seemed to like to do. Like every kid, of course, I played sports, but I knew I liked to draw. I knew I wanted to paint. You know, every entrepreneur has a story about, &#8220;Oh, I used to sell lemonade in the neighborhood.&#8221; I think everybody has a great story around that, but for me, I used to draw on people&#8217;s clothes like graffiti or the Super Mario Brothers character or their initials, and that was my hustle. That was my side project. It was how I brought a little extra money for school shopping. Growing that&#8217;s what I did, and eventually, that was the beginning of my tech career. After high school, I was like, &#8220;What am I going to do?&#8221; I went to a one-year school for computer graphic design and ended up doing that and getting a job at the Jacksonville Daily News Paper for computer graphic design. An area which you know about, Jacksonville, NC.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I feel like it&#8217;s rooted in my blood and my history to be a connector. Being someone who brings communities together.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>I know Jacksonville very well. I grew up 45 minutes from it.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I worked about four years at The Jacksonville Daily News. Two years where I was doing graphic design, newspaper ads and then two years in IT. I started doing desktop support and to show my age, I used to go to people&#8217;s houses with a floppy disk to set them up with dial-up networking. So I feel like it&#8217;s rooted in my blood and my history to be a connector. Being someone who brings communities together.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. So, when I first connected with you and discovered you seven or eight years ago, you were deep in the North Carolina tech scene in Raleigh and I was just a bartender who happened to like tech. You were one of the first people I discovered when I found Twitter and that whole network of techies in North Carolina. What was the North Carolina tech scene like at that time? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I moved to Raleigh in 1998 from Teachey, NC  and that&#8217;s the beginning of the end of the first dot-com bubble. Raleigh-Durham and The Research Triangle Park and that whole area were like, &#8220;We are Silicon Valley 2.0.&#8221;  The tech scene at that time had Sony Ericsson, Cisco, SASS, all these tech companies.  When the crash happened, it hit the NC community harder than other tech communities because it didn&#8217;t have the wealth to put back into the community like Silicon Valley has. A lot of entrepreneurs just didn&#8217;t survive. Innovation and the tech ecosystem wasn&#8217;t thriving and growing. It just came back to sports and universities. I felt like, &#8220;Wow, there&#8217;s still a lot of opportunities here, there&#8217;s a lot of community here, but we&#8217;re not coming together.&#8221; That was the beginning of blogging. That was the beginning of blogger meet-ups and then tweet-ups. Twitter launched in 2006. I was one of the first 1000 users to join Twitter. Then we started seeing the beginning of the web 2.0 movement. People were like, &#8220;Everything&#8217;s a fad.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No, this is great! It&#8217;s now connecting us with people all over the world. We can build relationships; we can create communities and awareness.&#8221; I started connecting with people at NC State and then we  began doing blogger meet-ups. Me being a geek, a nerd and working IT, I was into everything tech. I was reading everything that happened in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;We can replicate—at least from an event standpoint—what they&#8217;re doing over there in Boulder too. So the community started growing. There were a lot of people like my friend Ryan who’s at IBM. Another friend who was at an interactive agency, Kipp, who&#8217;s now the CMO of Hub Spot. We have another friend Jeff, who was working at a marketing agency. Now he&#8217;s a professor—I think in Chicago—teaching social media and business.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;When the crash happened, it hit the NC community harder than other tech communities because it didn&#8217;t have the wealth to put back into the community like Silicon Valley has. A lot of entrepreneurs just didn&#8217;t survive.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all came together and just started doing these events and replicating from content and an event standpoint what we saw in Boulder and Silicon Valley, like Ignite events. The community started growing and surprised some, but when you think about it,  it made sense because the universities and Research Triangle Park had an active iPhone development community. There were a lot of IOS developers who were one of the first teams to make a million dollars on the app store. Just like even today, there&#8217;s a Bitcoin community in the area. So the tech community was thriving, all the pieces were there, but we all came together to start making the events more community focused.</span></p>\n<p><b>Walk me down that path from doing all this great work in the Raleigh tech scene to then moving to Silicon Valley and making moves there. What was the impetus for moving across the country to build something on your own?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So if I&#8217;m 100% honest, when I was saying that I was reading all of the blogs and reading everything that was happening in Silicon Valley, there was some jealousy there. Being a geek and being a nerd, you want to be a part of the energy. You want to be a part of what&#8217;s happening in tech. I&#8217;m not a person that&#8217;s a big fan of tradition or stereotypes, or being put in a box. I&#8217;m just like, if they can do it, I can do it too, right? That&#8217;s how I think and operate. And so, I got fed up for a while. I was just doing a lot of work in NC and a colleague reached out to me. He was like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s build this mobile app. It&#8217;s similar to Foursquare but just for the Raleigh-Durham area, we called it TriOut.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Being a geek and being a nerd, you want to be a part of the energy. You want to be a part of what&#8217;s happening in tech. I&#8217;m not a person that&#8217;s a big fan of tradition or stereotypes, or being put in a box. I&#8217;m just like, if they can do it, I can do it too, right? That&#8217;s how I think and operate.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>I remember that.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, one of the few people. And so we came together, we launched the TriOut iPhone app and a social network. So from 2009 to 2011, that was what we did. We were a startup in the area, one of the few tech startups. And we grew the platform, the service, and had a lot of great support from small businesses, but even in that time the companies were not ready for location-based platforms or using a mobile app to reach the customers. Most of the businesses were not even embracing Twitter and Facebook, much less a mobile app. That took a lot of work and energy out of us, knocking on doors of businesses and trying to grow the startup in the area. We did get some interest from investors, but we ended up selling the platform technology to NC State University.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We received tons of crazy press. We were in CNN’s documentary Blacks In America. CNN created some controversy, but we had people talking, and the show inspired thousands. Because for the first time, you saw African-Americans and women and minorities on TV doing tech startups. It wasn&#8217;t that common; African-Americans were like, &#8216;what&#8217;s that?&#8217; They didn&#8217;t think it was for them because we just didn&#8217;t have the exposure and lack of role models in the tech industry.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2011, the data came out that only 1% of tech startups are founded by an underrepresented individual and by that time I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m part of that  1%. I know how hard it is. I&#8217;ve been in tech my whole life, what else can I do to learn but also educate others to be more successful. So I partnered with a colleague of mine, Angela Benton, and we had an idea for a startup house helping unrepresented entrepreneurs go to Silicon Valley for the summer. It would be a mix of the real world meets the social network, and we pivoted and just created an incubator-accelerator and moved to Silicon Valley for four months. That was the birth of NewME. We received tons of crazy press. We were in CNN’s documentary Blacks In America. CNN created some controversy, but we had people talking, and the show inspired thousands. Because for the first time, you saw African-Americans and women and minorities on TV doing tech startups. It wasn&#8217;t that common; African-Americans were like, &#8220;what&#8217;s that?&#8221; They didn&#8217;t think it was for them because we just didn&#8217;t have the exposure and lack of role models in the tech industry. So I officially made that move in 2012 from North Carolina to San Francisco. </span></p>\n<p><b>What were your first impressions of Silicon Valley like? What were you expecting and how was it similar or different to those expectations?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I haven&#8217;t been asked that question that way before. When we moved to Mountain View, I was expecting Mountain View to be more like how San Francisco is now. That was the first impression. I also was surprised how everything closed around 9 o&#8217;clock. Isn&#8217;t this Silicon Valley; this is where things are happening. I thought people would stay up and work all night at coffee shops. No, everybody&#8217;s gone at nine. So I was like, &#8220;Hmm. Surprising.&#8221; Later I learned most of the developers were hacker houses.</span></p>\n<p><b>There was no Helio&#8217;s (a coworking cafe we both frequented in Raleigh) open &#8217;til midnight.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, there&#8217;s no Cafe Helio&#8217;s in Mountain View. But one of the biggest surprises that is still relevant to this day was that people say how competitive it is as a tech entrepreneur. It is very competitive, especially when you’re trying to raise capital. Everybody is trying to reach the same 50 to 100, 200 investors. But overall, because of the density of entrepreneurs, everybody&#8217;s willing to help. That was surprising because in North Carolina there was only a small hub of entrepreneurs, the same thing in Durham. In Chapel Hill, there’s community around UNC, but it&#8217;s so competitive because everybody&#8217;s trying to fight for those smaller amounts of investment and there’s a limited awareness of community. So that was surprising, like wow, there&#8217;s so many people that want to help you. It was also surprising as I learned about how the ecosystem operated, how people may or may not help you.  If you are working on something world changing, if you are cool, if you are getting into the right circles, if you are drama free. You know what I&#8217;m saying, if you&#8217;re a signal that the ecosystem measures entrepreneurs by.</span></p>\n<p><b>When you got here, what was the community of underrepresented entrepreneurs like? How did people form support networks at the time and what were some of the biggest issues they were facing?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we first came to Silicon Valley, people had started reading about us in the news. We were in the Wall Street Journal. We were in a CNN documentary, and then because of our relationships using social media, we had a network. We weren&#8217;t starting from zero, which was very, very helpful and valuable. When we came to San Francisco, there was an organization called Black Founders. They held a welcome brunch for us. When we got here, we were already working with Mitch and Freada Kapor. They were mentors and speakers in our program. We were connected to Ken Colemen, another was a mentor, Stephen Adams, who had been out in Silicon Valley for 20 years. These individuals who have been here, they were opening doors and embracing us, and that was important. It felt right because we came from North Carolina, and I was too surprised also. Everybody knows that there&#8217;s a sense of a problem that there&#8217;s a lack of diversity in tech. And some people have been out here for years who have made a lot of success for themselves and their network, but it hasn&#8217;t been pushed to the forefront of the conversation. And I was surprised why has that been the case. If you&#8217;re here, why hasn&#8217;t there been more effort? I was surprised about that. At the same time, I started understanding why, because there are unspoken rules that you don&#8217;t talk about race in tech. Because of the false belief of meritocracy. You don&#8217;t speak of culture because it&#8217;s the good old boys who work and the create the culture, it works, so why to change it. You don&#8217;t fit in. You&#8217;re not a culture fit. I started seeing how these communities operated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless, the community embraced us, but not everyone. Some people told me; &#8220;Don&#8217;t come out here and mess it up for us.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ve got it good right now. I made it. Don&#8217;t screw it up for me.&#8221; Which is unfortunate, but I get it. So it was good and bad.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I started understanding why, because there are unspoken rules that you don&#8217;t talk about race in tech. Because of the false belief of meritocracy. You don&#8217;t speak of culture because it&#8217;s the good old boys who work and the create the culture, it works, so why to change it. You don&#8217;t fit in. You&#8217;re not a culture fit. I started seeing how these communities operated.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>What have been some of the most exciting parts of building an incubator and building conferences? What has been some of the most fulfilling parts of that work for you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hearing the stories later. That has been some of the most inspirational aspects of this all. I do this work because I love it. I do this because it&#8217;s needed. I do it because I want to leave a legacy for my son, and he says, &#8220;Well, my daddy is doing this, and he did it for me.&#8221;  And I care! I&#8217;ve traveled to speak at conferences in Detroit and Atlanta and abroad, and you hear entrepreneurs and individuals say, &#8220;You know what, I read about you, and that inspired me to get into tech now. And now I&#8217;m working for this hedge fund.&#8221; Or, &#8220;Now I&#8217;m doing this startup.&#8221; Or, &#8220;Now I&#8217;m doing this.&#8221; Or, &#8220;I saw you on TV, I read this article, and now I&#8217;m hosting this event.&#8221; That is the most exciting part. It&#8217;s also un-measurable in some sense because you don&#8217;t know all the people you can reach or who’s watching you. You see the work you&#8217;re doing and hope for that they can learn and get inspired for themselves. So that has been the most valuable. And then there&#8217;re the other tangible aspects of it where somebody got a job through an introduction or someone met a co-founder or  some serendipitous meeting happened because of the work we&#8217;ve been doing. And then, of course, there&#8217;s the one where people just created a team, and they&#8217;re raising money because you introduced them to the right investor and so forth.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I do this work because I love it.

I still deal with the fact that I didn&#8217;t go to an Ivy League school. I haven&#8217;t created a product that millions of people have tested or downloaded. I haven&#8217;t raised millions of dollars. I haven&#8217;t had an exit or created a 100x opportunity for an investor. I deal with imposter syndrome. Those things are all signals in Silicon Valley and tech people look at those terms of success metrics. That doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s right, right? It&#8217;s just their signals in Silicon Valley / Bay Area, the system that&#8217;s been established. But those signals play in the back of my mind where even today,I was talking to my partner. She was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have to live up to those standards, and I don&#8217;t have to get those individuals approval, right? Who are they, and why should I be trying to get their approval or live under their standards? I don&#8217;t have to seek to get in that particular network. The work I&#8217;m doing is just as important or more and what I&#8217;m doing has better values and integrity.&#8221; So the biggest challenge is most definitely the confidence and dealing with credibility despite all the work and success I’ve had so far.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Coming from North Carolina and being black, I still deal with confidence and credibility.

I haven&#8217;t raised millions of dollars. I haven&#8217;t had an exit or created a 100x opportunity for an investor. I deal with imposter syndrome.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Yeah, I feel like one of the biggest moments for me in the last few years was having this moment where I was like, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t have to please and get approval from every single person. It&#8217;s a waste of time. It&#8217;s unproductive.&#8221; </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, and now I learned to stop caring about what other people think. Now I focus on being happy and what that means. Being happy with just yourself and being aware of how you think, having a cognitive awareness of how you process your thoughts, your emotions. Being inspirational to yourself and how you think and how you feel, thinking &#8220;You know what? I&#8217;m happy, I&#8217;m healthy,&#8221; and like you said not trying to please everyone.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I learned to stop caring about what other people think. Now I focus on being happy and what that means.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Have you had mentors or people that you&#8217;ve looked up to for inspiration or  people who have been pivotal in your career along the way?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, one I mentioned earlier was Steve Adams. He&#8217;s  the entrepreneur at Heart also. Been in Silicon Valley for around 20 plus years, and raised over 20 or 40 million dollars over his career. He’s an African-American guy who pulled me along the side and just really has helped coach me and advise me on life. Sometimes it&#8217;s been about a product I’ve built but most times the feedback has been about my life. Another person is, Shellye Archambeau, who&#8217;s the CEO of MetricStream. Shellye is an inspirational mentor where she drops those little nuggets, life lessons like, &#8220;Keep doing what you&#8217;re doing. I believe in you, keep writing, keep story-telling, keep me updated.&#8221; Because all those things were a sign that someone cares, right? Another mentor is Cedric Brown. He&#8217;s also from North Carolina. He went to UNC, and he works with Kapor Capital For Social Impact. We have lunch every couple of months in Oakland and really just talk about life and relationships. Those individuals are people I call mentors but also </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">friends, and it took a while for me to develop those relationships. There’s  also Steve Blank. Steve Blank is a guy who everybody knows in entrepreneurship tech. I got a chance to build a relationship over a two or three year period with Steve. I’ve been to his house a couple of times and talked about entrepreneurship, and he gets it. Being able to leverage his brand, his name and path to my career has been key. Also Kathleen Warner and Kelly Hoey, who both are on the East Coast, these two amazing ladies who I’ve met over my career, they get it, they care, and they just want to see good people win. It&#8217;s been good to be able to have those individuals in my life.</span></p>\n<p><b>You&#8217;re from a tiny town. When I meet people who are from tiny towns in the South, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh my god, you got out too, that&#8217;s crazy!&#8221; [laughter]  So I&#8217;m curious to know, where do you think you got those entrepreneurial qualities like that appetite for risk and the drive, where do you think that came from?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It originates from both sides of my parents. I look at my father. He and I spent a lot of time working on cars. That&#8217;s what we do in the South, right? We worked on engines; we worked on go-carts. We just like to build things with our hands, so I think that&#8217;s where the artistic side of me came from, but for me it was computers. My mom used to work for the government. She worked for HUD, the state, and always had that kind of entrepreneurship drive and spirit. She&#8217;s now had her own business in Teachey for ten, maybe fifteen years now. When she started, I helped her when it was a print business. Then she got into insurance and taxes, and it&#8217;s been her business for years. The house is paid for, and they are doing well in the South.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I got that drive from both of them. When I look at my grandfather on my mother&#8217;s side, he died before I was born, he was a police officer. My great-aunt was a school teacher on my mom&#8217;s side. And my grandfather on my father&#8217;s side was an entrepreneur.  I remember going out with him; he used to take me to the farm. That was my summer job. I would work in a field all day starting around 6 am until like 3 o&#8217;clock, and we&#8217;d go to the farmers market and sell the vegetables, and he&#8217;d give me five dollars. I&#8217;d be like, &#8220;That&#8217;s all I get?&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><b>How do your friends and family and folks from way back home feel about how far you&#8217;ve come and all the work that you&#8217;ve done?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With my immediate family, I have two sisters, a younger and an older sister. They all get it. My parents, they get it. I was always pushing tech on them.  “Hey, do this, sign-up for that.” I set up my moms’ network at her home office. Her home office network was better than the local town&#8217;s network, with more computers and printers. I would say that they are happy for me. It&#8217;s been tough because a lot of African American families—and people in the South, no matter what race, they don&#8217;t leave their hometown that often. They don&#8217;t go too far.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been tough because a lot of African American families—and people in the South, no matter what race, they don&#8217;t leave their hometown that often.

One of the things I remember  my first cousin telling me. We all have family who have been in and out of jail or things of that nature. He&#8217;s a cousin  who now is getting his life together, who&#8217;s working,  but he told me” You’ve  got to keep doing what you&#8217;re doing.” He&#8217;s like, &#8220;I tell my friends I&#8217;ve got that cousin who&#8217;s out in Silicon Valley who works with Google and all these other big tech companies. He&#8217;s out there making a name for himself.&#8221; For him to say that, inspires me to keep doing what I&#8217;m doing because he didn&#8217;t think that it was an opportunity for him, and you don&#8217;t see that many African Americans in tech.  I have a Slack group called BlackMenInTech.com, with about 300 black guys from across the country who work at Google, Facebook, Uber, etc. Some are entrepreneurs; some live in the midwest. We had a guy in the Slack group who lives in Cleveland, Ohio. He was like: &#8220;Wow. I didn&#8217;t know there were this many black guys working in tech.&#8221; Because if you are in Cleveland, Ohio or New Bern, North Carolina, and you read all the news you&#8217;d think it was just all white guys. You wouldn’t know that there&#8217;s any diversity out here at all. So the work that we all are doing is important,  these stories that you are doing are important.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you are in Cleveland, Ohio or New Bern, North Carolina, and you read all the news you&#8217;d think it was just all white guys.

So the work that we all are doing is important.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s one of the biggest drivers of this project because I think people are going to come to this and for the first time see people that look like them and who are from where they&#8217;re from. I think so many people have no idea that Silicon Valley is even an option for them because they&#8217;ve never seen anyone like them in it. That&#8217;s a problem.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or they don&#8217;t see any women. They don&#8217;t see any women in various roles. Women in leadership or women CEOs and technical positions, or even the fact that you can just create a real business using technology. It doesn&#8217;t have to be trying to go to IPO. It doesn&#8217;t have to be the next Instagram or whatever, but just great business. It&#8217;s getting so bad that the narrative out there is  that you can’t just live here and be happy [chuckles].</span></p>\n<p><b>In the last few years, how have you seen tech culture change, particularly in being more accommodating to people of color. How has it changed, and/or has it gotten worse? How about right now in 2016?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard Business Review and Fortune Magazine began publishing articles on diversity programs, and how they are not inclusive of white men and how white men are starting to fear a more diverse workforce and fearful of losing job opportunities. Then you start seeing these posts on income inequality from super well-known rich investors. Then stories about income inequality became a hot topic. I began to think that people with money who have been making money in tech, which has primarily been white males are now looking at this change regarding diversity inclusion and income inequality, computer science for everybody, and saying that &#8220;Isn’t it starting to level the playing field?&#8221; You look at all these VC posts and all these subtle changes, then the monopoly and the control they&#8217;ve been having, the power they&#8217;ve been having over who gets funded, how they get funded and controlling the market. It&#8217;s going to impact how they get access to early deals and opportunities to create wealth for them. That insinuates fear, and that bothers me because when people start taking emotional actions around fear where they don&#8217;t want change, that mindset is going to hurt everyone.  That bothers me.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You look at all these VC posts and all these subtle changes, then the monopoly and the control they&#8217;ve been having, the power they&#8217;ve been having over who gets funded, how they get funded and controlling the market.

We need to show that diversity is good for the world and good for the American economy. We need to do what we can to close the wealth-access gap. Because that whole economy is going to crash if we don&#8217;t.</span></p>\n<p><b>Whoa, that is blowing my mind for second right now, the idea that diversification of entrepreneurship makes VCs lives harder because it messes with the system they’ve built and optimized for.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, [chuckles]. It&#8217;s an uncertain outlook, but if you look at how things are being portrayed, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening, right?</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. Absolutely. That&#8217;s a major thing, and well-founded. This is the year of VCs biting their tongue, that&#8217;s for sure.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know, right? But the good side of it is the fact that these stories are now being told, people are taking action. With action comes accountability, with awareness comes responsibility, more resources towards education. People are starting to care more. We call it a tech business, but everything we do affects people. We have to care more about people no matter what race, what gender, ethnicity, or religion. We have to look at ways of how we can create wealth because tech is one of the only industries in the world where we don&#8217;t have to go to a four-year university to get a job, even though that&#8217;s where the bar is set with ivy league schools, right? You can come into tech; you can learn to code or be great at project management, or have the right passion and get a job,to create wealth and impact not only in your life, but your family&#8217;s life. We need to do that with the income gap,  the education gap,  the average salary gap, and the unemployment gap. We need more people in tech from all races, genders, and cultures.</span></p>\n<p><b>Personally, how do you think tech can be more accommodating to underrepresented entrepreneurs in the industry?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For me, I believe tech can be more accommodating when we look at the workforce. We need people who care in leadership and are who are held accountable. They are in positions that can be nonthreatening or non-bias towards diverse individuals. I think that&#8217;s some of the hardest problems we&#8217;re facing right now, that a lot of the workforce is only 2% black, 1% Latino, about 11% women. How did that happen? That&#8217;s just the workforce. People have to care and be accountable, and they haven&#8217;t been. If they were, it wouldn&#8217;t be as it is. For entrepreneurs, it&#8217;s going to come down to the biases that investors have regarding what makes a successful team because it’s not just the money, right? It&#8217;s the opportunity they get. It&#8217;s the chance to test your hypothesis to see if this problem that you&#8217;re solving has a particular value. Everybody doesn&#8217;t get that opportunity. Because even if you get the money,  then it&#8217;s the mentorship, it&#8217;s the relationship, it&#8217;s the open doors, the partnerships, everything that comes with the relationship with investors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I see so many great entrepreneurs who work their asses off. But it&#8217;s everything else. They get special access because they&#8217;re in a particular network, but if you don&#8217;t fit a particular stereotype, you don&#8217;t get that same opportunity. We need to change that in entrepreneurship. At the same time, I can&#8217;t speak for the Latino culture because I&#8217;m not Latino, but for the African American culture, we also need to look internally, look at our culture and how can we change our priorities. How can we change our focus? Regarding where I grew up, yes I got into art, but it was all about Michael Jordan, it was all about Michael Jackson, it was all about Eddie Murphy, and the comedians. That&#8217;s why we have this next generation of Kevin Harts, and just repeat, repeat, repeat. We&#8217;re in 2016; now we need more role models in tech. We also need  to disrupt the African American culture and our values, get focused on creating wealth. That&#8217;s not on the street, it&#8217;s not on the court, it&#8217;s not on the stage.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Regarding where I grew up, yes I got into art, but it was all about Michael Jordan, it was all about Michael Jackson, it was all about Eddie Murphy, and the comedians.

Either for others or yourself?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You made me pause because you said for myself and I&#8217;m like, what do I do for myself? [chuckles]</span></p>\n<p><b>Right. I know the feeling.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For me, I just really like being healthy. Being healthy and happy. Being fit is also part of the San Francisco culture. But I just really like being happy and healthy, emotionally, intellectually, and also physically. That&#8217;s taking care of yourself, as number one.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. It&#8217;s hard to prioritize, isn&#8217;t it? Honestly. I finally figured it out this year, but I sympathize with people who can&#8217;t figure out how to make that work because they&#8217;re trying to make it work career or money-wise.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s hard to balance. Professionally I did a lot of cool projects over years. In 2014 I created a non-profit BUILDUP. In 2015 my partner, Melinda Epler and I started Tech Inclusion because we had begun seeing all the conversations around diversity and inclusion in tech, but most of the conversation are around the problems. We were like, we know too many people who do amazing work, but they don&#8217;t know each other. We also know a lot of the new diversity hires, a lot of individuals having this conversation, but they are not connected. Everybody was looking for solutions. We thought” how can we bring people together?” So we created the Tech Inclusion conference in 2015 and recently announced a new partnership with Google For Entrepreneurs; and we&#8217;re going to have the conference in New York and San Francisco. We hope to create opportunities and the spaces to solve these problems.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in five or ten years? Do you think you&#8217;ll still be in tech and what kind of problems do you see yourself solving?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m always going to be in Tech. So I pause, and I laugh because I&#8217;m like—where I see myself in five years could depend on how the presidential race goes in 2016, and where I am in the country or out of the country. Regardless, in five years, I hope to continue to support the early stage entrepreneurs, and my passion is to have a venture fund one day. I’m going to put myself in the position to be on that path. Maybe get into education by teaching, and I still have some aspirations for entrepreneurship—a couple of ideas.  I have asthma, so I want to do something in asthma and biotech.</span></p>\n<p><b>My last question for you is: what advice would you give to folks from similar backgrounds as you who are hoping to get into tech? What do you wish you&#8217;d known in the beginning?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My advice is to keep learning. There&#8217;s a book called Mindset, by Carol Dweck and I think everybody should read it because it’s about knowing the difference between a growth mindset and a fixed mindset. If you have a growth mindset, you can learn anything and have the confidence to complete your goals. I think that&#8217;s like number one. Number two, believe that no door is closed. If you just learn how things work, you can open any door. Number three is to travel. If I never got outside of Raleigh, I  wouldn&#8217;t be in San Francisco today. So, travel the world, get out of the country, get your passport and just go!  Learn, see the world, build relationships and then be mindful that we have so many ways of communicating today. Create a real strategic plan of how you are going to communicate with your network. This sounds so basic, but in this world, if you put out positive energy, put out to the world that you are somebody and want to help others, it will come back to you. You just have to continue to put out positive energy. Last, build something. Whether your build a product,  a community,  a service,your network,  your intellect, build something!</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;In this world, if you put out positive energy, put out to the world that you are somebody and want to help others, it will come back to you.

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><strong>Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</strong></p>\n<p>I grew up in the Bay Area. I was born in Berkeley and lived here up until the end of high school. Growing up, I wasn’t sure if I wanted to study science or do something more artsy. I had an undiagnosed learning disability, and I struggled with some of my academic classes, but did better in theater, art, and music. Once I was diagnosed with a learning disability, and able to get accommodations, I started doing much better in my academic classes. My AP Physics teacher my senior year of high school encouraged me to pursue physics in college, and that was the first time a teacher had ever said to me: you have a talent, you should do this.</p>\n<p>So my freshman year of college, I took an intro theater class and an intro physics class, and I said to myself, whichever one I do better at, that’s the universe telling me what I should major in. I got such a good grade in my physics that I didn’t need to take the final exam. And I got the worst grade of my college career in the theater class, which wasn’t that bad but&#8230; I thought, okay this is the universe telling me that I should study physics. I ended up majoring in physics and continued doing it all the way through my PhD.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>I’m curious to know what it was like being a lady in astrophysics PhD academia.</strong></p>\n<p>There have been a lot of articles about being a woman in academic science in the press recently. I participated in a Twitter hashtag (#astroSH) that got press coverage. The hashtag was motivated by some of the high-profile cases of sexual harassment in academia.</p>\n<p>It was challenging being in a male-dominated field. Physics is 85% male. There are many ways you are made to feel different. There are hard interactions with male colleagues. I tweeted about a bunch of different things that happened to me over the years that were hard. For instance a guy walking by my lab, and I was wearing dish gloves because I was washing some parts of my experiment, and he said, “That’s what women are good for, doing dishes in the kitchen.” And men repeatedly told me that I got to where I was because there was some quota that needed to be filled and they needed to have a certain number of women in a program. Men would frame interest in me as being about my research, but then once I was in a situation where I’m alone with them, it switches to being a date. It’s hard when you are constantly reminded of your gender, or made to feel really uncomfortable and sad about the fact that you thought something was professional attention but it was actually about your gender.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Men repeatedly told me that I got to where I was because there was some quota that needed to be filled and they needed to have a certain number of women in a program.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What was it like transitioning into tech and what was the impetus for that?</strong></p>\n<p>When I graduated from my PhD., I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do. I applied for a lot of different jobs. I applied for teaching positions, research positions, and I applied for jobs in industry. In the end of my search, I had a bunch of different opportunities. What attracted me to tech in particular that it felt like a good way to apply my technical skills but in a way that was more down to earth.</p>\n<p>A lot of my astrophysics research work was very obscure and theoretical. It was hard for me to feel motivated when there were maybe ten people in the world who really understood what I did. Tech is also a more casual industry than finance or consulting. I felt like it would feel more culturally similar to academia. I’m from the Bay Area and there’s a lot of tech jobs here. It meant that I didn’t have to move. I did my PhD at Berkeley so I was back here again. Ultimately I thought “Well, let me try this out. It means I get to stay here, it means I get to try this new thing. If I really hate it I’ll re-apply for academic jobs again in a year.” But immediately, I enjoyed the work so much and realized this is a much better fit for me, in terms of the day-to-day, than academia.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What are the most exciting things to you about your work? What really activates you?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m a data scientist, and essentially what I do is work with a lot of different people within my company to help them make decisions and decide what action they should take, based on what’s going on with the data. I help my company understand how customers are behaving, where there are inefficiencies, where we’re losing people, or where we are most successful. It’s really fun, because I’m constantly working on different areas and different focuses. Sometimes I’ll be working with the marketing team. Sometimes I’ll be working with our technical team. Sometimes I’ll be working with product. I have a very broad scope.</p>\n<p>People come to me with open-ended questions, and I get to define how we might get to an answer and ultimately help them make the decision they need to make. It’s a really creative process. I have a lot of freedom of how I’m going to approach the problems. Then it’s also very technical. There’s usually a lot of math and programming and visualizing data. Then there is also a communication piece, where I’m taking this complex set of data and trying to explain it to people who maybe aren’t as technical, and help them understand what the data means, and how they might take those insights and translate them into some action. It uses a whole bunch of different skills.</p>\n<p>People are usually super grateful. Everyday people come to me with their problems, if can help them solve them, they’re really excited by that, and so it’s a very satisfying job. It’s not customer-facing. My clients are internal, and I like that a lot because the people who I help, are the people that I interact with every day. So I feel very valued within my company.</p>\n<p>The work is always changing. I never do the same thing twice. One day I’ll be doing something for our CTO, then the next I’ll be working on something for our PR team. So, I’m constantly learning, constantly having to think of new ways to approach problems. It’s not boring or repetitive at all, which is really fun.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about the areas where I have privilege. I’m white, and so I don’t really understand what it’s like to be a person of color. How can I understand that experience more and advocate more for people of color in my community?&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>When did you turn your attention to feminism and inclusion?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s been a long-standing interest of mine. When I was diagnosed with a learning disability in high school I became very interested in advocacy for people with disabilities, and I founded a group at Occidental College (where I went for undergrad) for students with disabilities. Our goals were to create awareness in our communities about what having a disability means, what it entails, and how everyone can be supportive in various learning environments. We also educated people with disabilities on how to advocate for themselves, and communicate their needs to others. Being part of that group was really great. It helped me think about not only my own disability, but other types of disabilities. There were people in that group that had physical disabilities, or mental health issues. It very much broadened my perspective and helped me understand the way that these disabilities impact people’s lives.</p>\n<p>In graduate school, I ran a women’s group for physics, astronomy, and planetary science students. We focused a lot on the gender issues is those departments, most of which had less than 20% women in them. I started learning about things like unconscious bias, imposter syndrome, the wage gap, stereotype threat, and the leaky pipeline within STEM.</p>\n<p>When I graduated from Cal, I was asked to be on the Committee for the Status of Women in Astronomy (CWSA), which is part of the American Astronomical Society, (astronomy’s big professional society). As a member of the CSWA, I started writing for their blog and and eventually became the editor-in-chief. Then I started talking about these issues and engaging with them with the entire astronomy community. When you write about things on the internet, especially feminism [chuckles], you get a lot of pushback. Having (mostly online) conversations with people who don’t necessarily believe the things that you’re talking about, or don’t think that there’s still discrimination this day and age, well it has really helped me tune my debating skills. It has also helped me to take an intersectional approach to feminism, and not just think about women’s issues but the intersection of race, gender, sexual orientation, ability, class, religion and try to understand how all these identities interplay with each other.</p>\n<p>Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about the areas where I have privilege. I’m white, and so I don’t really understand what it’s like to be a person of color. How can I understand that experience more and advocate more for people of color in my community?</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;My disability affects my reading and writing. I have something similar to dyslexia. The way that I frame it is that the neural paths in my brain that connect and decode the words I see and assign meaning to them are really jumbled. So, for me, it takes a really long time to interpret written words or to express my thoughts in written words. I read at about the twentieth percentile in terms of speed. My intelligence is much higher than that, so there’s this mismatch in how I perform when doing timed reading tasks versus the level that my intelligence says I should be able to perform.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>What is it like being in tech with a learning disability? Does it affect you at all now? I’m also curious to know, in your work in the community, what issues you’ve seen with other folks with disabilities in Silicon Valley.</strong></p>\n<p>Having a learning disability hasn’t been something that has affected me as strongly in the working world, because I’m not often in scenarios where I’m being tested or asked to complete some task with a very fast timeline.</p>\n<p>My disability affects my reading and writing. I have something similar to dyslexia. The way that I frame it is that the neural paths in my brain that connect and decode the words I see and assign meaning to them are really jumbled. So, for me, it takes a really long time to interpret written words or to express my thoughts in written words. I read at about the twentieth percentile in terms of speed. My intelligence is much higher than that, so there’s this mismatch in how I perform when doing timed reading tasks versus the level that my intelligence says I should be able to perform.</p>\n<p>I have figured out a lot of work-arounds for that. Like if I have to read something, I always have my computer read it to me, because I can comprehend things I hear instantaneously, but reading involves me going back a few times before I can understand it as well. And similarly, when I write, usually the first draft has tons of grammatical errors and mixed up words. But if I have my computer speak it to me then I can easily fix those things. Now I just know if I have to read something or write something, it’s going to entail this extra process.</p>\n<p>In the working world, it’s not that often that you’re handed something and have to read it in front of someone while they watch you, so people don’t really notice that it takes me longer to read and write. But it is something that I have talked to with my managers about and just said, “Hey, this is something that I struggle with. If there is ever a scenario where I’m going to need to perform something or need to read something kind of in the moment, it would be better for me to have it ahead of time. When there is a really important report that I’m going to have to get out, it would be great if you could look it over, because this is a thing I struggle with.” People have been really understanding and I think I’ve gotten better with my own work-a-rounds such that it doesn’t impact me as much as it did when I was in school.</p>\n<p>In terms of general disability issues in the working world, there are certain accommodations that are required by the American disabilities act like having accessible bathrooms or having accommodations for people who struggle with mental heath issues.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there doesn’t tend to be a lot of conversations about disabilities at a company wide level. Most people don’t even understand the scope of how disabilities affect people’s work. For instance there is somebody at my work who has fibromyalgia, and that means that sometimes he can’t physically be at work because he’s in a lot of pain.</p>\n<p>Luckily our work is such that we can do a lot of it remotely and so he’s able to work that out with his manager. If he wakes up and he’s having a really bad day, then he’ll work from home. Yet that involves having to disclose this status to his manager, and some managers are more understanding than others. So one thing that I try to do (in conjunction with HR) at places I work is to increase understanding as a company about how disabilities affect people and the ways that they can be accommodating that aren’t going to negatively impact the performance of the company. I think there is a general concern: “Oh well, if I hire someone with a disability, that person is going to be less productive, or less valuable to the company.” Just helping people understand that is not the case, as long as you’re willing to be flexible and give accommodations which allow people to perform at their best.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think there is a general concern: &#8216;Oh well, if I hire someone with a disability, that person is going to be less productive, or less valuable to the company.&#8217; Just helping people understand that is not the case, as long as you’re willing to be flexible and give accommodations which allow people to perform at their best.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>How have you observed the cultures of academia and tech? How are they similar, how are they different?</strong></p>\n<p>Both are places that have very intelligent, passionate, quirky people who are trying to do something that no one’s ever done before. People who are pushing the boundaries of what’s out there. In both places there is a lot of competition and other people attempting to you, or do the same thing.</p>\n<p>I would say that one thing that has been very different about being in industry (versus academia) is that there are not as strong power dynamics. In academia, you have these tenured professors who are famous, and they can pretty much make or break your career. You’re very dependent, especially when you’re a student or a postdoc, on these people to write papers with you, giving you access to their grants, giving you access to their experiments, and their telescopes. If there’s some situation of abuse going on or you’re having a personality conflict with someone, it’s harder to survive that in the same way as you can in industry. In industry, especially in the tech industry, as a data scientist or a software engineer, I’m in high demand. If a company is not the right fit for you, or you clash with someone, then you can easily find something else, so there’s not as much pressure to make a situation work.</p>\n<p>Because of these hierarchies of power in academia it’s a little bit trickier. One bad relationship with someone could mean you have to leave academia, or switch research areas entirely. I think there are also more protections in place at businesses. Ultimately HR wants to make sure that nobody sues each other, and so they try to proactively deal with any conflicts. Whereas in academia, if a student is having a problem, often the university is incentivized to just get rid of the student or hide. They aren&#8217;t incentivized to protect the student. Ultimately (right now at least) there is a lot more jobs available in tech versus academia. When I was applying for postdocs, I’d be lucky if I got one or two postdocs in the entire country. If those didn’t work out, then there wasn’t that many options for me. Whereas once you’re in the tech industry, you are constantly being approached by recruiters to join the next new hot startup, so you feel like, “Okay, I have a lot of options and I’m not stuck anywhere. I don’t have to put up with a bad situation.”<br />\n<strong>In general, has your life improved as a woman since you go into tech? It sounds like it.</strong></p>\n<p>For the most part it’s been night and day better. One start-up where I worked, I was the first woman on the engineering team and for about six months until we hired the second woman. They were amazing. I never felt like my gender had anything to do with why I was hired. I always felt like, “You were hired because you’re the most talented person that we interviewed, and we think you rock.” That was really, really great. But simultaneously they were very careful to make sure that I felt comfortable and not have it be this like bro-grammer environment. There were many times when they checked-in with me, saying, “Hey, was that okay? Do you feel uncomfortable?” They really were thoughtful about making sure that it was a good environment for me, and that was amazing.</p>\n<p>In general, I’ve just always felt like being a woman on the technical teams has, if anything, helped me. The men have been extra supportive, I guess, because they recognize that I am one of a few women and they want to make sure that I feel okay and comfortable, and so I have felt that people have gone a little bit above and beyond to try to make me feel supported.</p>\n<p>I have had some interesting experiences with companies where the general culture at the company has been a bit bro-y, and so while my direct team has been really supportive for the most part, I’ve had to deal with general company culture that was pretty hostile for women.</p>\n<p>One company I was at we had this policy that you should lock your computer when you leave it unattended for security reasons. And as kind of a joke / punishment, if you ever came across a computer that was unlocked, then you could send a message to the all-company chat channel from that person’s account. These messages were usually funny or silly. So my first day at this job, I forgot to lock my computer because, you know, it was my first day, and I was still figuring it out&#8230; and someone not only posted on the all-company channel from my account. “It’s my first day and I’m already drunk. Oops.” which was kind of embarrassing, but then also sent a private message to a senior member of my group saying, “It’s only my first day. but I already want you.”</p>\n<p>And he knew right away that it wasn’t me, but his response was, “Keep it in your pants, Kirkpatrick.” And ultimately, it was just a very weird, charged interaction to have with a teammate on your first day at a new job. And so my response was, “Okay, I guess this is what it’s going to be like here.”</p>\n<p>And another thing that happened at that company was that in my first couple weeks I was being trained to interview people for the data team. My first phone interview that I was conducting by myself, I was in a conference room and facing towards a glass wall outwards to the rest of the company. One of my coworkers was trying to mess with me during the interview, to make me laugh, or whatever. At first, he walks by and he’s being a little silly, like walking funny. I was not responding because I was trying to focus on this interview. So he just kept escalating and escalating, and it got to the point where he was pretending to masturbate and ejaculate on the glass wall, and was pushing people up against the glass and humping them.</p>\n<p>I came out of the interview, and said, “When I am interviewing someone, that’s me being a representative of our company to an outside person. What are you trying to do by making me distracted or feel weird during this interview? That’s really not okay. Not only is it unprofessional and disrespectful to this other person, it also makes our company look bad to this outside party.” He said, “Oh, lighten up. Come on.” I said, “I don’t want to see you pretend to masturbate. But this is not just about you and me, this is affecting someone else and my ability to judge this other person.” I got really mad.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;At first, he walks by and he’s being a little silly, like walking funny.

So he just kept escalating and escalating, and it got to the point where he was pretending to masturbate and ejaculate on the glass wall, and was pushing people up against the glass and humping them.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>I’m curious to know what it’s like being a local and watching this whole ecosystem change over time. What are your feelings about being a local in the tech community?</strong></p>\n<p>I definitely have a lot of weird feelings about being one of those techies that a lot of local people are resentful of because of the ways that the tech industry is gentrifying San Francisco, raising the cost of everything and all of these inequities between how much tech people make and other people in the community make. I work in mid market, so I work right near the Tenderloin. And it makes me feel very uncomfortable going from Civic Centre/Bart Station where there are people living in the BART station, sleeping in puddles of their own urine. People who are incredibly sick – physically sick &#8211; and clearly need medical attention. I walk from there into this fancy building where there’s free food and alcohol, and we have all these amazing perks. The dichotomy of it is so striking.</p>\n<p>And especially because I went into graduate school thinking I was going to be an educator, and so I never anticipated making the salaries that we make in the tech industry&#8230; It’s way more than I ever anticipated having. Way more than my family had when we were growing up. It’s uncomfortable for me to know, “I am the one percent” of the US that we’re all talking about, like I’m the people that the protesters of the Google buses are protesting.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We’re not serving those populations. We’re just pushing them away, hiding them. That’s very uncomfortable for me. There’s a lot of decadence and extravagance in the tech industry that I don’t feel is deserved, and I feel weird taking part of.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, when I was growing up, you wouldn’t go to the Tenderloin. You just don’t go there, period. You wouldn’t ever go to certain areas of Oakland. And now it’s ok to walk around those neighborhoods, and you don’t have to constantly worry about safety. It’s nice to see these neighborhoods becoming less violent, but at the same time, poor people are being pushed out.</p>\n<p>We’re not serving those populations. We’re just pushing them away, hiding them. That’s very uncomfortable for me. There’s a lot of decadence and extravagance in the tech industry that I don’t feel is deserved, and I feel weird taking part of. For instance, I once went to a holiday party, and it was like a scene out of a movie. Every hour new entertainment came out. We would have acrobats doing aerial performances, or people on stilts, or a marching band. It must have been a $200,000 party. It was open bar and there was a tattoo artist doing temporary tattoos and a photo-booth. I just kept thinking, “This is so over the top. Why are we spending ten grand on acrobats when we’re not even a profitable company.”</p>\n<p>While I understand in order to retain talent, you need to keep your employees happy, I don’t know. I’m uncomfortable with a lot of the decadence and extravagance, especially for companies that are being funded by investor capital and are not profitable. I guess the bottom line is, I don’t know how I feel being part of it. I’m so grateful for my job and I’m so grateful that I am well-paid, but there’s something messed up about the fact that there are people who are so wealthy next to people who are so poor. We don’t have the services in SF to help the homeless people, yet we’re spending all this money on the app “Yo.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;While I understand in order to retain talent, you need to keep your employees happy, I don’t know.

I just think that there is this different set of standards for tech companies than there are for brick and mortar companies, and I don’t know why. I’ve intentionally chosen companies where it is clear how they are going to make money, and I think that they are addressing a need that is not being addressed in another way. So I would like more of a focus on that.</p>\n<p>And then if we’re going to be bringing tech companies and putting them into poor communities, we need to to be also supporting the community, and finding a way to lift up those communities, so that we’re not just this negative impact that is causing gentrification and housing prices to go up, and increasing traffic, but also a good force within the community. I would like that to be more of the ethos of what we see ourselves trying to do in the Bay area, in San Francisco, and in Oakland, as companies are starting to move to Oakland. I don’t know the best way to do that, but I’d be happy with taking a pay decrease, or having less extravagant parties, and having more of that money go towards supporting our communities. We don’t need to have this dichotomy where everyone in the tech industry is driving Teslas but walking over homeless people on the way to work. I would like that to be more a part of our belief system as an industry.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;If we’re going to be bringing tech companies and putting them into poor communities, we need to to be also supporting the community, and finding a way to lift up those communities, so that we’re not just this negative impact that is causing gentrification and housing prices to go up, and increasing traffic, but also a good force within the community.

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Let&#8217;s start from the beginning. Tell me about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born in Richmond, Virginia, nowhere near Silicon Valley or any really tech hub. DC is rising but it&#8217;s nowhere near like SF, New York, and LA. I grew up with that cliche story of growing up in a lower income area, growing up in the projects, not growing up with a lot, having a single mother. I try not to harp on that too much because I know there&#8217;s so many others that have dealt with that same background and those same problems. But growing up was actually pretty normal to me because when you grow up and struggle that&#8217;s all you know. When you don&#8217;t see other people who have a lot, you just think living the way you do is normal. You think gunshots are normal. You think drug dealing is normal. You think not having enough to eat is normal. So I never grew up thinking that I had it rough or I had it hard. I knew it sucked at times but I never really felt like we were poor. It wasn&#8217;t until I got my first job at 14 and I realized that, &#8220;Man, there&#8217;s people out here that are doing a lot better than I am.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up it just felt  really normal. And like I said, when I first got that first job it was at this museum and I started to see white people for the first time. Just imagine like seeing white people on TV and seeing these people but never really integrating with them or interacting with them. Because I came from a side of town that was mostly black and Latino. So I started to see those things, and I saw nice cars; I saw families seeming so carefree and just frivolous about their spending, and I started to realize that there was a whole &#8216;nother world out there. And then that&#8217;s when I really started to get into the internet and really started to research, and I saw that the was a whole &#8216;nother world outside of what I grew up in.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Growing up was actually pretty normal to me because when you grow up and struggle that&#8217;s all you know.

You think not having enough to eat is normal. So I never grew up thinking that I had it rough or I had it hard. I knew it sucked at times but I never really felt like we were poor. It wasn&#8217;t until I got my first job at 14 and I realized that, &#8216;Man, there&#8217;s people out here that are doing a lot better than I am.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that&#8217;s really what made me start to love technology—the ability to connect with people outside of me few block radius and from what I knew. From there it was just working and supporting my mom. You know, my mom didn&#8217;t go to college. No one in my family went to college. She worked as a custodian for the Federal Reserve Bank and she didn&#8217;t make a lot of money. I was paying a lot of the bills. Like I said, I started working at 14 years old and, yeah, it was definitely a struggle. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout my highschool years, we maintained but there was certain that happened within my family with financial struggles that led to me being homeless. I don’t like to talk too much about my family because I just feel like that’s their business and this is family business and so I kind of like put the focus on me being homeless. I don’t like talking about their situation because I just don’t feel like its right to put out their situation. There was a series of events that led to me being homeless for a year.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;My mom didn&#8217;t go to college. No one in my family went to college. She worked as a custodian for the Federal Reserve Bank and she didn&#8217;t make a lot of money. I was paying a lot of the bills. I started working at 14 years old and, yeah, it was definitely a struggle.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was my senior year of high school and it was really, really a tough time for me. I lived out of my car that didn’t work so I couldn&#8217;t even turn the heat on or anything like that it was just parked, and yeah, it was tough. I tried to make it to school—my goal was three days a week. Some days I would have to go to school without showering for a few days.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was just tough for me because I was always such a social guy and I felt afraid to interact with people because I felt like I smelled or I was wearing the same clothes or things like that. I would do a bunch of different odd jobs like cleaning people&#8217;s windshields at gas stations and just hanging around until the owner of the gas station would chase me out or shoveling people&#8217;s snow, or raking their lawns, or doing whatever I could to make money and afford a motel for myself and things like that. It was a really, really difficult time in my life, probably the hardest thing I&#8217;ve ever done.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There was a series of events that led to me being homeless for a year. It was my senior year of high school and it was really, really a tough time for me.

I tried to make it to school—my goal was three days a week. Some days I would have to go to school without showering for a few days.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know breaking through tech is tough, especially for people that look like myself, but finishing school and still making something of myself after that year was probably the hardest thing that I&#8217;ve ever had to do. I still was able to graduate high school and make my mom proud. That&#8217;s probably my biggest accomplishment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was fortunate that my girlfriend at the time, her dad didn&#8217;t know I was homeless, but he knew I was in a bad situation. He paid for one college application for me. That college application was to Virginia Tech. Virginia Tech really appealed to me because I was so enamored with tech, technology, computers. I really thought I wanted to be a computer engineer. I ended up going to Virginia Tech, but I didn&#8217;t know anything about financial aid or anything like that. So I applied to financial aid late, and I didn&#8217;t get enough money to cover my first semester, so I needed to get a job. My first job happened to be a marketing role at United Way. I was able to blend my love for technology with marketing. I was like, &#8220;Why does our website look the way that it does? We need to optimize this. Why are we using Facebook to promote our events? Why are we using social media? Why are we collecting e-mails and have a newsletter? Why aren&#8217;t we working on our search rankings and things like that. It was just my introduction to technology, and I didn&#8217;t know at the time what I was doing. I didn’t know about digital marketing and growth marketing and things like that. It just was like an uncanny ability for me to understand both sides and the tactics to help grow a company. That kind of led to where I am now. A year after that I started my first company at 19 years old, which I actually sold years later. That&#8217;s the beginning.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I used to go to the public library, I didn&#8217;t have internet, and things like that, or reliable internet at home. I used to collect the free monthly trial AOL discs just to access the internet.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>How did you first get exposed to tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the local library! At my job we had a computer. I would sneak on a computer and look, and research things, and I saw all the cool things happening. I remember just watching Facebook, and I was so mad because I wasn&#8217;t in college and I didn&#8217;t have a college e-mail address, and I couldn&#8217;t access Facebook. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s this cool thing just happening in front of my eyes. Reading all these articles on the web and what was going on, and none of my friends were talking about this, it seemed like a completely different world. I was like a kid in his own imaginary world, it was just great to do that. I didn&#8217;t really have any friends or anybody else that was really interested in it because you&#8217;ve got to understand when we started becoming teenagers, my friends started becoming drug dealers. My friends were caught up in other things that were street related. They weren&#8217;t really worried about tech or anything like that, so it was two different worlds. I used to go to the public library, I didn&#8217;t have internet, and things like that, or reliable internet at home. I used to collect the free monthly trial AOL discs just to access the internet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I just found different ways to play with tech even though I didn&#8217;t have the money for it. Though marketing was never anything that I thought I wanted to do. It&#8217;s interesting because when I was a kid, I used to sell, which is part of marketing smart drugs by the way. I used to buy like candy and bubble gum and indifferent things, and then I would resell it at a premium price at school. That&#8217;s when I really started understanding supply and demand before I even took any business classes. Because I could buy a pack of bubble gum at 50 cents and then sell each piece for 50 cents. I had a love for that entrepreneurial spirit and marketing and selling.  And, when I came over to United Way, there were a lot of things that really made sense to just blend the things I learned about technology and the web. </span></p>\n<p><b>Tell me about starting a company at 19. How did 19-year-old you have zero risk aversion and just feel like, &#8220;I can do this?&#8221;</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know what&#8217;s so funny? When I started this company, I didn&#8217;t tell a lot of my friends. It was one of those things I wanted to try and do on my own. It was all bootstrapped. I was using a little bit of money that I was making from United Way. They started me off at $7 dollars an hour or something like that. I ended up at $9 when I became full-time. Putting a little money away there and was doing a little consulting on the side. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I imagined working as a marketing consultant, doing things that I probably would do now and charge so much money for, for like $12 bucks an hour or $15. I thought I was making bank at the time and I didn&#8217;t realize how much they were getting over on me. Back then, you could probably get a whole marketing strategy from me for like $75 bucks. And I thought I got over on you! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, at 19 I liked to party. In a lot of places there&#8217;s a very strong bar culture of 21+ people. I was like, well what about us 18 to 20 year olds? There&#8217;s tons of us and we don&#8217;t really have anywhere to go. So I created a platform. I created a strategy where I would take these events and I would go to different warehouses, or clubhouses, or restaurants, or wherever, and throw parties and live events there where you didn&#8217;t have to be 21. You didn&#8217;t have to drink there and people 21+ joined too. They thought  &#8220;Oh, these parties are happening, these live events are cool.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then I match that with my love for technology and digital where I really implemented Facebook as a strong growth driver for my events. I was lucky back then. Facebook events started coming out, it was like a strong driver for growth of getting people involved in the events, and then also setting up my own digital platform for the company where people knew that you could keep updated with all our different events and things like that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest drivers of growth was photography. You have to remember, this is back in 2007, 2008, when people didn&#8217;t have these fancy iPhones, with these great cameras. When people came out to our parties, you could get a really nice picture done, and you knew that one or two days later, you&#8217;d be able to see those pictures on our platform. Also on Facebook as well and different Facebook groups. We were able to blend tech, the digital space with photography, with live events that kind of make a really, really cool company. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was really successful for a while and it died down a little bit when I started getting more into my academics. Then I started up again and it was doing moderately well, but then I actually had someone who was in the live events business that wanted to kind of adopt my model. By this time, Instagram had came out and all that stuff, so our photography hook wasn&#8217;t as strong. So they bought my company. It wasn&#8217;t like a huge amount or anything, but it was the most money I&#8217;ve ever seen in my life, and it was a huge, a huge, huge accomplishment for me. Life changing.</span></p>\n<p><b>So then you ended up being a marketing executive in your early 20s.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did. So I sold my company and also I was working for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Strauss\" target=\"_blank\">Neil Strauss</a>, famous author and entrepreneur, radio host. He had really popular books like The Game and Emergency and things like that. The Game is probably his most famous book. He used to write for Rolling Stone. He has his own masterminding group. He also has his own radio show on Sirius XM, so I was doing digital initiatives and digital marketing for him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Ellis_(entrepreneur)\" target=\"_blank\">Sean Ellis</a> reached out to me, which most people in the tech industry know as the most famous marketer. He’s known for coining the term <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hacking\" target=\"_blank\">growth hacking</a>, by growing companies like Dropbox, Eventbrite, LogMeIn, Uproar &#8211; numerous IPOs, numerous billion dollar companies, and he gave the keys to marketing for his company to a 23-year-old kid, and it was really, really exciting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We worked on <a href=\"https://qualaroo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Qualaroo</a> together and got to the point of being profitable. We all know working in start ups, especially SaaS businesses, reaching profitability is hard. To help with marketing and lead a company into the green was really exciting. Along with that, starting GrowthHackers.com with him and that turning into its own entity in this own company itself. It was a very exciting time for me as a marketer. It really strengthened my skills and my technological skills, and my marketing skills during that time was awesome. At the time I was running marketing and I end up becoming the head of growth over at <a href=\"https://growthhackers.com/welcome\" target=\"_blank\">GrowthHackers</a>.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I would literally work maybe like 6:00 AM and work until 7:00 pm. On the way home, I would stop at Subway every single day. I would grab a tuna sandwich. I&#8217;m a man of habit. I would grab a tuna sandwich, scarf that down, get home, and literally start working on projects and different things that I was doing until  3:00 or 4:00 in the morning.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, I started <a href=\"http://www.millisense.co/\" target=\"_blank\">MilliSense</a>, which is my marketing firm that I am CEO of today. I was having a conversation with my mom, and I was like, &#8220;Hey, I have all these people coming to me about consulting or whatever. It&#8217;s killing me tax-wise. Look, I need to start something, start a company.&#8221; I&#8217;m sitting there with my mom, and I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;I really want to dedicate something to her.” I was like, &#8220;Hey mom, I want to name my company after you.&#8221; And she was like, &#8220;No, no you&#8217;re not. Whatever.&#8221; And I remember sending her pictures when I got the LLC and things for MilliSense. The name comes from my mom&#8217;s name, which is Millicent. And because my mom always made sense of things.</span></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what we kind of do when we work with a lot of tech companies, a lot of startups, a lot of companies that are boot strapped. I try not to take that mentality of those agencies or marketing firms that try to overcharge people and things like that. I really want to help entrepreneurs and people be able to accomplish their dreams. So there&#8217;s really no set price for us to do things. We&#8217;re all about negotiating.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would literally work maybe like 6:00 AM and work until 7:00 pm. On the way home, I would stop at Subway every single day. I would grab a tuna sandwich. I&#8217;m a man of habit. I would grab a tuna sandwich, scarf that down, get home, and literally start working on projects and different things that I was doing until  3:00 or 4:00 in the morning. It was pretty crazy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was running growth and doing stuff for growth hackers while running various other projects. I was reached out to by Sticker Mule. I was 25 years old at the time, and they offered me the opportunity to be their chief marketing officer at 25 years old. It was a huge opportunity, because a lot of people aren’t aware of Sticker Mule. Sticker Mule isn&#8217;t your average start up. It&#8217;s really a mid-size business, but the revenue they&#8217;re generating, the number of employees that they have, made it a major operation. To manage a marketing team of that size and be a C-level exec at a company like that was amazing. I was able to have a lot of success there and it really built my profile even more. We grew revenue almost 50% during my time there. We almost tripled website traffic. I was so nervous going into that role, and I did my thing. It was great.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was balancing that with MilliSense, so I was CEO of MilliSense still, while serving as CMO of a multi-million dollar company. Call me crazy.</span></p>\n<p><b>That is crazy. I&#8217;m so curious. Your hustle comes from your background for sure. But I&#8217;m also curious, you were able to confidently go in as a consultant as a teenager, and you were charging just $12 an hour, but you were still selling it. I&#8217;m curious to know, where did you get that belief that you could do it? You know what I mean? It&#8217;s like you didn’t get that crippling gene of self-doubt.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Actually, I would disagree with that. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m my biggest critic. I doubt myself a lot. I just don&#8217;t allow self-doubt to prevent me from accomplishing the things I want to do and making my dreams happen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the people that worked at United Way with me, her friend had a small restaurant in Blacksburg and just needed help with creating a Facebook page and doing some social media stuff and marketing, and she was like, &#8220;Hey, you know, I&#8217;ll pay you $10 an hour to help me out.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;$10 an hour. Yeah, I&#8217;ll absolutely do this.&#8221; So once that happened, there was a chain of events where just word of mouth, and then it just made me more confident that I could do the things that I could do and be able to say, &#8220;No, I actually want $25 an hour or $30 an hour or $50 an hour.&#8221; It kind of just spiraled from there, but yeah, I go back and forth in my head about a lot of things all the time. Sticker Mule was one of them, and that was one of the latest things that I did.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m my biggest critic. I doubt myself a lot. I just don&#8217;t allow self-doubt to prevent me from accomplishing the things I want to do and making my dreams happen.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the way, to update, I&#8217;m back and full-time as CEO of my company, MilliSense. I&#8217;m also working on some software to go along with the consulting service as well, which I&#8217;m excited about. I&#8217;m also full-time with Microsoft as a consultant. We&#8217;ll try to do the numbers, try to figure out the numbers, but I&#8217;m working on new projects with Microsoft that I&#8217;m really really excited about. I&#8217;m leading growth and marketing strategy.  It&#8217;s cool to get enterprise experience on a tech level too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m pretty sure we&#8217;re going to talk about struggles later. One of the biggest things was, it is an absolute bias in Silicon Valley about working at a Google, Facebook, or Twitter, or Yahoo beforehand and you will just not have doors open up to you if you hadn’t worked at one of those companies.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, why don’t we just dive in, tell me more about your experiences with big company bias.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s been really tough for me because I understand my skill set and my abilities and I know I can do that at a larger scale, but I&#8217;ve literally been turned down by some really successful companies for roles because they told me I didn’t have the enterprise experience. That’s really disheartening to me because I feel like the things that you have to do at a small or mid-sized company pales in comparison to some of the things that you have to do at an enterprise.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There’s also a bias for people who speak out on diversity, that speak out on social issues, that are voicing their opinions and not being quiet.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My friends that have worked in enterprise companies don’t realize what it feels like to know that hey, if I don’t work today that literally might affect the bottom line of my company, my livelihood and so there’s a lot of bias there if you haven’t come from one of those companies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That leads to a whole slew of problems because people that look like me aren’t at those companies or aren’t getting those opportunities especially if you didn&#8217;t come from a Stanford or some Ivy League school or whatever. It’s really, really disheartening and the you see the new Unicorn companies the Snapchats, the Ubers the IBMs, what are they doing? The exact same thing! They’re trying to get the Google people, the Facebook people, and they want people with the same pedigrees that look like them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a wheel that keeps turning. It feels like you’re not going anywhere. No matter all the success I&#8217;ve had, the credentials I&#8217;ve built, a lot of people will say, “Oh, you’ve made it,” and they don’t realize there are still a lot of doors closed to me just off the strength of big company experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s also a bias for people who speak out on diversity, that speak out on social issues, that are voicing their opinions and not being quiet.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The one thing I&#8217;ve noticed about many people that I&#8217;ve met, black employees at the Googles, and the Microsofts, and the Apples,  they stay in their lane. They stay and keep that cookie cutter image no matter how they may feel internally where they won&#8217;t speak out on things, where they won&#8217;t step out and be who they really are because they know they have to fit this certain image for this company. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s really disheartening that some of the more successful people had to do that. I&#8217;ve actually ran into this at companies I&#8217;ve been at where they say, &#8220;Hey, you can&#8217;t really speak out on these things,&#8221; or &#8220;You can&#8217;t say the things you do because our customers see that and things like that.&#8221; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can&#8217;t be a part of a company where I can&#8217;t speak my mind, and stand up for the things that I believe in, or the things that I feel that are unjust. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It definitely closes doors to you because they&#8217;ll see you not as a person, but as a problem. They&#8217;ll see you also as someone who has their own personal brand. You look at a company like Snapchat&#8211; can you name one person at Snapchat that has a personal brand outside of Evan Spiegel? Everyone just falls in line. I think you should be able to try to be the best person that you can be. Unfortunately that doesn&#8217;t happen a lot of times in tech.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t be a part of a company where I can&#8217;t speak my mind, and stand up for the things that I believe in, or the things that I feel that are unjust.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>You mention you touch on your experiences with age bias and retro bias and your pre-interview I&#8217;m curious to hear more about your experiences.</b></p>\n<p>On age and racial bias – Before I took a job with Sean, I was applying to a lot of tech jobs, and I wasn&#8217;t getting responses back. I had a LinkedIn profile, I had a really good resume, I had run marketing at a few different companies, I had successfully sold a company, and I still wasn&#8217;t getting responses back, and I couldn&#8217;t figure it out.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My spidey senses were tingling when it came to racism, and so I created a fake LinkedIn page with a white person stock photo, changed up the name to be very, very let&#8217;s say proper, and pretty much had the same resume. I sent this out to 10 people, because I&#8217;m all about testing. I sent the A/B testing racism here in the 7 out of 10 people that didn&#8217;t respond to me actually responded to that fake profile. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You probably tried to find me on Linkedin and you realized I don&#8217;t have one. I never felt the need to use Linkedin because I just was so turned off from that experience. I know a lot of people that are judged by their Linkedin profile. The color of their skin. The way that they look. I deleted my profile and I was just like, &#8220;Man that&#8217;s sucks.&#8221;</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I created a fake LinkedIn page with a white person stock photo, changed up the name to be very, very let&#8217;s say proper, and pretty much had the same resume.

I even talked to–I&#8217;m not going to name his name, but he is a white young male CEO of a successful startup right now. They&#8217;ve raised millions of dollars in capital, and he said that to get a job he actually had to photoshop his face to make him look older in his linkedin. That&#8217;s coming from a white male, so there&#8217;s definitely ageism and racism when it comes to this stuff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve literally been told, &#8220;Hey, you need to wait your time and put in more time.&#8221; And things like that. That is completely related to age, because as far as the steps I&#8217;ve needed to take to get to where I am, I&#8217;ve been successful.  Everywhere I&#8217;ve went I&#8217;ve got the experience. I have proven results. I&#8217;m not a person who doesn&#8217;t have results. I&#8217;m all about data, and so the fact that people still judge me off my age is crazy. I used to wear that as a badge of honor because I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m 25, I&#8217;m 24, I&#8217;m 23, and I did this? I thought that was awesome.&#8221; And then I started to realize that a lot of people resent that unfortunately. Because a lot of people look at you like, &#8220;Hey, when I was 25 I was still a product manager making $50,000 at wherever, and you want to be a VP.&#8221; So it&#8217;s tough.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve literally been told, &#8216;Hey, you need to wait your time and put in more time.&#8217; And things like that.

Like, people just literally look past us and think that we&#8217;re not equipped, or because we look different or may dress different or not come from the same background as you that we can&#8217;t do this job. I&#8217;ve actually been turned down from jobs which should have been like my expectations and things like that because </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like people judge me for things outside of my work and my resume.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So it&#8217;s definitely been tough.</span></p>\n<p><b>I remember when I was head of comms, and like 22 years old, and I act so much younger now than I did then, because if anyone found out how young I was, their demeanor to me immediately changed, and they literally started treating me like a tiny girl-child, but I just pretended I was in my 30s my whole early 20s. It was the only I could be taken half-seriously. </b></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m also interested in talking about kind of anti-marketing bias, like I worked in comms for instance, which is non-technical.  Even though growth hacking is very quantitative and data driven, it&#8217;s still kind of lumped into that soft-skill or not-necessary-skill category. I&#8217;m curious to just hear your thoughts on that bias.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, it&#8217;s so bad. It&#8217;s really, really bad because a lot of people are from that engineering background, and they think marketing is so trivial. A lot of engineers I&#8217;ve met, surprisingly enough, think they&#8217;re good marketers. They think that they understand, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You&#8217;re not, you&#8217;re not a good marketer.&#8221; And it&#8217;s almost like&#8211; I&#8217;ve come across a lot of engineering founders that is not more so, not that they&#8217;re looking for marketing help because they feel like they need someone else&#8217;s expertise, but because they don&#8217;t have time for it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They still, in their heads, think that they are the best marketer for the company and things like that. And that&#8217;s really, really, really tough to deal with. And whenever I come into a new company, it&#8217;s almost like a stare down with the engineers. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You got to prove that you&#8217;re not going to back down, and that you understand the things they&#8217;re doing, you understand the lingo.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I would say this to a lot of marketers with in tech. Even if you don&#8217;t learn, learn how to speak, learn the lingo. Learn, and maybe to do basic things so that you can at least have conversations with these people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure that everything you’re doing can be proved with data because that’s what they’re going to respect.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A lot of engineers think we’re just people that just come up with ideas and thought at a wall, but if you come in and you have an actual organized disciplined data that you&#8217;re having processed, they’ll respect you a lot more. I feel like marketers have the shortest leash when it comes to start-ups and tact.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Make sure that everything you’re doing can be proved with data because that’s what they’re going to respect.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know engineers that are chilling, they just do the minimum and especially if you have a founder that’s not technical. Engineers get away with murder especially if they don’t understand what the engineers are doing. Marketers they give brain for everything and a lot of times it&#8217;s stuff that has to do with market fit and the product still needing to be developed, but if the product isn’t selling and the marketer’s getting blamed for it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was actually just having a conversation with somebody growth hacking. It is like that cool thing in tech right now but it’s tough because people look at us, is like these unicorn marketers that are supposed to just come into your company, and then, boom hockey stick growth and that&#8217;s not the case. And so, a lot of the guys that I know that work in growth and marketing are at places maybe, 8 to 12 months and that&#8217;s it. These are the people that get blamed for when the product isn&#8217;t selling, when they&#8217;re not getting traffic and things like that, and is not looked at engineering product. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, that&#8217;s probably been the toughest thing for me. I was mentoring at a tradecraft in San Francisco, and one of the things that I told him was that to be a growth marketer is a nomadic lifestyle within start-ups and Tech, because when things go wrong, you&#8217;re going to be looked at first. And you&#8217;re going to be the one that is let go, or you&#8217;re going to be the one that gets to blame. And so, just realize that if you want to be a marketer at Tech unless you&#8217;re at a big company where you more relaxed like in Facebook or things like that, you&#8217;re going to be jumping from company to company, because you&#8217;re going to get into a lot of bad situations.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are the things that you love about being your own boss and approaching work that way?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest thing that I love is &#8211; and you don&#8217;t hear me talk about it a lot &#8211; is being able to give back to the community and do volunteer work. I don’t have to worry about meetings and calendars. I&#8217;m able to volunteer every week and do the things that I love to give back.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I remember being cooped up in offices at startups, working from dusk till dawn on projects and not having time to myself. To have that flexibility to do the things I love and to be able to give back, and to travel. A lot of my travel is related to business. I&#8217;m headed to Boston, then St. Martin, then Beijing and Nevada and all these places but even though is work related, I still get to enjoy traveling and doing things. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I could say that, because I&#8217;ve built something for myself and that feels really good. I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m a slave to someone else&#8217;s company or beliefs, or whatever. I&#8217;m able to speak freely and do the things that I want to do, because I know that I&#8217;ve built a skill for myself and I&#8217;ve worked hard, and I say this with the most humility, that I know that I have talent. I know that I can bring something to the table, and so, because I continuously work every single day to get better as a marketer and as a leader. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have that value proposition that you have to let me be who I am if you want to work with me</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s been great so far and has led to a lot of great opportunities, and I&#8217;m loving it.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do your friends and family from home feel about how far you&#8217;ve come?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They think I’m a celebrity.  No one from where I&#8217;m from really makes it out, or does these things, or is printed in magazines, and have articles written about them, or get to be interviewed by people like you. This doesn&#8217;t happen. It&#8217;s all pretty crazy to them. They still look at me like the same person though. They&#8217;re still going to make jokes about me. They&#8217;re going to still be hard on me, but at the same time they are definitely enamored with the idea that so many people are appreciative of my story. People want to hear from me and want to work with me and they&#8217;re definitely really, really proud. That&#8217;s something that means the world to me. Got to keep pushing!</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? What&#8217;s really exciting to you? What frustrates you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m very excited about the overall interest within the tech industry and how everyone&#8217;s kind of throwing their name in the ring. I know some people don’t want other people invading Silicon Valley. They don&#8217;t want so many people gaining interest. What they don&#8217;t realize is that these mainstream people or people from different places gaining interest will only affect the youth. </span></p>\n<p>When I get to talk to kids from back home, and I tell them about how basketball players and celebrities are involved in tech. It&#8217;s just really inspiring to people. I really like the work that <a href=\"http://www.code2040.org/\" target=\"_blank\">CODE2040</a> is doing. <a href=\"http://www.blackgirlscode.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Black Girls Code</a> and all these different organizations raise interest within the black, Latino, and minority communities and movement into tech. Those are the things that I&#8217;m most excited about, personally.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really see any change when it comes to diversity. I hear a lot of people talking and then you see the actions of people and it doesn&#8217;t really change. That&#8217;s really disheartening for me to see within tech, that I really feel like things are not going to change. When you look at these companies that are talking about diversity and how much they want to change, you&#8217;re like, &#8216;Yeah, they&#8217;re going to change.&#8217; Then you look back in 2012, and they were saying the same thing and still have the same numbers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The thing that I dislike is this whole unicorn bullshit and these crazy wild valuations, talk about how the bubble is bursting, how that&#8217;s affecting actual, real quality startups that&#8217;s coming out now, that are struggling to get funding because you&#8217;ve had so many of these flops or these companies that got way too much money without any type of validation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think it&#8217;s just going to be really, really tough for people. All the startups I&#8217;ve started, it&#8217;s all bootstrapped. It&#8217;s all stuff that I did myself, so I&#8217;ve never had to raise money for any of my companies. It&#8217;s now a really, really tough time for that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t really see any change when it comes to diversity.

So that&#8217;s something that I don&#8217;t really like as well. There&#8217;s a lot of things I don&#8217;t like, but I won&#8217;t harp on them. Hopefully, they&#8217;ll be changed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People have to understand that having white women at your events and conferences does not mean diversity. Yes, a white woman is diversity, but a lot of people, it was like, &#8220;Oh, we have have a black man and we have a woman, so we have black representation and woman representation.&#8221; No, you can have a black woman and you can have a Spanish woman, you can have a Native American woman, you can have different women of color at these events. Just because you have a woman there, does not mean that you have diversity, and I absolutely hate that. It annoys me so much. Or just try convincing conferences that just don&#8217;t have any color at all, and I&#8217;ll call them out. I&#8217;ll call them up. People think sometimes that I&#8217;m calling them up because I&#8217;m jealous because I&#8217;m not speaking there or whatever. That is absolutely not the case. It&#8217;s just like, I just want to see people who look like me. I want to see people from diverse and different backgrounds speak at these events. And I feel like there&#8217;s so many people to choose from and you just don&#8217;t see it at all.

Like the Shopify store where you&#8217;re selling some T-shirts or whatever. It is to prove that I can do marketing. Look I&#8217;m 18, 19 years old and I sold $20,000 dollars in T-shirts in a year. That might not be a lot, but that&#8217;s a lot.

I thought the major problem with being an astronaut was that I needed glasses since I was five, not that I was not a man (there were no female astronauts yet). I didn&#8217;t think of myself as a girl or as a boy either, just as having unlimited potential.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was socially very inept. I didn&#8217;t really know how to make friends. I could play with kids, but I didn&#8217;t know how to have an emotional girl relationship despite the couple of girlfriends who did their best to teach me because they were stranded with me in a small town. I was the top of my school in high school and just absolutely knew I was either going to become a professional musician or a professional engineer, and I had no doubt about being able to do either. And I picked Engineering, because I could always do music as a sideline.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was one of those kids with a magical upbringing where I thought I could do anything.

I didn&#8217;t think of myself as a girl or as a boy either, just as having unlimited potential.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, I found university much harder than high school. Socially, again, I was still having huge problems. I was finding some friends that were amazing friends, who had the same interests as me, and we were connecting a way I&#8217;d never connected with other people before. Like the friends that I played “Magic: The Gathering” with after classes, and the friends I traveled to Gen Con with—the big gaming convention in the States. I traveled to Milwaukee from Kitchener-Waterloo for that convention. My studies were hard because now, I was with a hundred other students who had been the top of their classes. So I think that&#8217;s a pretty typical experience for men and women in Engineering. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I felt isolated for sure. I never knew how to analyze these things at a young age, so I was just oblivious. For example, I lost a friend in my first term who had been my roommate. After first term was over and we went off for our work terms and came back, I eventually realized she was no longer my friend, and I really must have been a social idiot to not know what I had done to make her not be my friend, and to take so long to realize that I had become not her friend. And by the time I realized, it would have felt really awkward to say, “Hey, why haven&#8217;t you been my friend for the last few months?” Like, to admit that I only just noticed. But I was so oblivious that at that age I could basically only shelve that information and try to understand it and process it later.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I really love solving problems and building things, and building on other people&#8217;s ideas. So my most successful times in University was when I got to do that, when we got to work on something together.  Sometimes it was outside of class like doing a creative writing workshop, and sometimes it was inside of class, like where we had to build a cardboard bridge for the Physics of Materials class. I knew that I would find that in industry, especially if I didn&#8217;t take a solitary engineering role. If I took a programming role and I stayed in front of my computer all day, or at least that was my image of it, then I wouldn&#8217;t be solving problems with people and be quite so collaborative. I&#8217;d be more isolated. </span></p>\n<p>What I didn&#8217;t realize and what many people don&#8217;t realize is that engineers, even the ones who are called “individual contributors” are still incredibly collaborative. It&#8217;s hard to be an isolated engineer in the modern software industry. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At least I was exposed to industry through my work terms. One of the fabulous things about my school was sending engineers off on work terms, six times in all. It was a five-year program so that they could send us off from January to April or send us off from June to August or send us off from September to December. So year-round, there would be engineering interns going off in all directions and some companies had this constant stream, not just summer interns, but a year-round rotation of interns coming through. And that exposure was fantastic for showing me that there were jobs that were people-oriented and collaborative. So the same thing I love about music, which was playing in an orchestra, I found that in computer science. It was initially being a program manager to bring together engineers with requirements and users and constraints and testers and making it all work, not instructing everybody what to do. So not like a conductor in an orchestra but the coordinator, the hub, the person who—by sharing the right information with the right people at the right time—could just make everything run smoothly.</span></p>\n<p><b>What originally brought you to Silicon Valley?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well I did have that moment of awe—of driving down the 101 and seeing one sign after another. In those days, it was seeing Sun and Oracle and AOL Online and Excite at Home. All of these signs along the freeway of companies I recognized—of innovative companies, one after another. So it was really fun to do that. I visited Silicon Valley from my first job up in Seattle before I moved to Silicon Valley. I spent four years in Seattle after university and I visited for conferences and meetings and things like that. And I knew where the interesting stuff was going on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wasn&#8217;t a good fit at Microsoft because it is a big corporation.  It can be a shark tank, rat race or whatever animal model you care to choose. I found a romantic interest in the Bay Area, and when the time came that I felt comfortable moving closer to this romantic interest, I was also quite happy to leave Microsoft and look for a startup job. And </span>I found one and it was wonderful. I got to hire engineers, and build a team, and design, and code.  In order to get that job, I had to pretend I was more of a programmer than I had been for the last four years, but then I quickly had to make good on that promise. I know from reading the literature that not all women feel comfortable doing the fake-it-till-you-make-it thing. They underestimate their abilities rather than overestimate and I certainly overestimated my abilities<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but I had the incredible support of a romantic interest.  He just thought it was a no-brainer that I could do this and he gave me a lot of confidence. The confidence of a parent or of a boyfriend can be huge for giving that boost, making the ask, applying for the job, saying, &#8220;Sure, I can do that.&#8221;  </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;A calendaring standard had been marinating in my head for years. I finally figured out I could make a proposal that people would be interested in. I made a proposal of, &#8220;Here&#8217;s the smallest thing that we could build as a calendaring standard, that we could implement and inter-operate between calendar servers and calendar clients”. That’s the interaction when you open your calendar and you get it from the server: something new will show up on the phone and you&#8217;ll see it even if you entered it in your computer. That was what I wanted to solve first—not invitations or scheduling—but synchronizing that specific kind of data between devices.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>What are some of the proudest moments of your career?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think the thing I&#8217;m most proud of happened after working on Internet standards for years, after I worked on some standards for document sharing and Web standards. Because I was involved in that while I was still at Microsoft, I was sent to look into the calendaring standards.  Not that Microsoft wanted to do anything but it needed to have somebody there to fill the seat at the table. But I was exposed to that so four years later, I had another chance to look at it and I had these ideas. A calendaring standard had been marinating in my head for years. I finally figured out I could make a proposal that people would be interested in. I made a proposal of, &#8220;Here&#8217;s the smallest thing that we could build as a calendaring standard, that we could implement and inter-operate between calendar servers and calendar clients”.

Thank you.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After that, I went from writing my own standards and leading working groups to actually directing a part of the IETF. Web standards, email standards, calendaring standards, instant messaging standards, and a few others; all the ones that people think of as the Internet. I was one of the directors of that area for four years (which means I got selected twice to do that). That was incredibly political work with a long-term horizon. And so, I was not just writing a document anymore that might become a standard. I was getting the people together that might form a working group, that might choose an editor, that might write a document, that might be edited, that might be approved, that might be implemented that someday people might actually use in their software. There are so many stumbling blocks on the road, in such a political process, to get approval to start these things to get community agreement. It was all about getting community agreement, getting consensus and the technical issues became sore points rather than the fun parts, because the technical issues were wrapped up in people&#8217;s egos and politics.  </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I went cold turkey on standards. I had been doing it nearly full time, it was nearly my whole job, and then I went away, I completely stepped away. I&#8217;ve never been back to one of those meetings.

Instead of this ten-year time horizon, how about a two month time horizon? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I went cold turkey on standards.

I guess another thing I was scared of: there are some cantankerous curmudgeons in these standards groups who have been there for twenty years, so I gave myself ten. I figured, if I don&#8217;t become a cantankerous curmudgeon in ten years, great, I&#8217;ll give ten years and that will be useful to the community and to the internet, but after that I should go, because the last thing I want to become is one of these people who says well, you can&#8217;t do it because of this, this, or this reason—always complaining and saying “you can&#8217;t, you can&#8217;t.”</span></p>\n<p><b>What are some of your favorite things about working in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The technology industry reinvents itself over and over again. Younger people or newer people come in and overturn the status quo. If I can&#8217;t make myself young again, I can at least make myself new again [chuckles]. I can jump into something I haven&#8217;t done before, and ask questions, and say, &#8220;Wow, why can&#8217;t you do that?&#8221; Or, &#8220;What if you did it this way?&#8221; Startups have turned out to be a place where I can perennially do that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of people want to say, &#8220;What industry are you interested in doing a startup in?&#8221;  This comes up when I network, which I do constantly trying to find my next startup. If I am in a startup for a year, that&#8217;s great, but I&#8217;m constantly networking because it takes time to find another startup. When I say, &#8220;Do you know any interesting startups?&#8221;, people say, &#8220;Well, what industry are you interested in?&#8221; Well, anywhere where I can be useful and new at the same time.  Where I can have that excitement of digging into something new, and the utility of bringing this pattern-matching experience, like the experience of looking at big systems, and deep diving into protocol issues, and various startups—bringing all that experience to a brand new problem. It&#8217;s pretty useful [chuckles]. I can say that with confidence.</span></p>\n<p><b>What have been some of your biggest struggles and roadblocks?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So some of the first problems that I ever had an inkling of were the problems of camaraderie. <em> </em></span>I&#8217;m pretty sure what screwed my first term at university was a little bit of sexual liberation, of looking like a sex object to the guys in engineering. That meant that I couldn&#8217;t be a colleague, or couldn&#8217;t consistently be a colleague<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Oh my God, once a guy in first term engineering from another class ran into my classroom and dumped a box on the table in front of me, in front of all my classmates, just before class started. They asked, &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; I looked, opened it up, and it&#8217;s a necklace. Instead of saying, &#8220;Oh, what an idiot that guy is,” they all looked at me: &#8220;What did you do to have this guy dump a necklace on you?&#8221; It made me stand out and be judged. Was I making women in engineering look bad? Well, it was my first time in college! Duh!

That was really hard. I toned everything down. I started dressing more conservatively again. I stopped flirting. I resolved, &#8220;Maybe I shouldn&#8217;t have coffee with guys.

The first team of people at Microsoft that I loved working with and I wanted to be part of the team as much as anybody else on the team, well they played basketball together. Actually, I played basketball in high school and I missed it, so I thought, &#8220;Oh, this is great! I&#8217;ll come play basketball with you guys since you say it&#8217;s a casual pick-up game.&#8221; But after a couple times, they started sneaking out without telling me they were playing basketball. My best guess is that they didn&#8217;t like bumping into me. I was the only girl on the court. They didn&#8217;t want to hurt me. They didn&#8217;t want to come down with their elbows and get me in the face. They didn&#8217;t want to have to treat one person on court differently. They just didn&#8217;t want me in that pick-up game, so they stopped letting me know when they were going and it was clearly not working, so I needed to find other ways of finding that camaraderie. I did. I played networked computer games and I loved them. In many ways it was easy for me because I love video games. I got into juggling, I just did all kinds of geek stuff. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Sure, I&#8217;ll do that geek thing, because here I am among geeks and it&#8217;ll be fun.&#8221; I really did enjoy that.

One of my favorite examples of being young and being underestimated, it&#8217;s very easy to walk into somebody&#8217;s office and just start asking questions like I need to learn this area, “can you answer some questions for me,” and ask a bunch of questions. But what I&#8217;m really doing is I&#8217;m getting time with a developer who would otherwise be prickly and defensive, and convincing him to change something that he holds dear by asking innocent sounding questions. And I learned to do it, and I felt manipulative, but it felt like it was really working so I tried to professionalize it.  I realized years later that what I was doing was the Socratic method.

In college, it was not possible to compartmentalize and even in my first few years out of college everybody made friends with everybody else from work.

And I get decision freeze sometimes, just where I don&#8217;t want to make one more decision, I don&#8217;t want to organize one more thing, or send one more email, or set up one more meeting.

What excites you? What frustrates you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We&#8217;re going through a couple of major changes that may be linked.  startups can build more functionality cheaper than ever with fewer people because we&#8217;ve evolved our web technology to be powerful and modular, so that you can build a little piece and hook it to five or ten other little pieces. When you build a website these days the internals are modular. You can pull in a module that does the login for your site and integrate that with a few tutorial steps and now you&#8217;ve got logins. Integrate a module that does image viewing and zooming; two days later you have image viewing and zooming. Those are both code modules that are open source, somebody else wrote, and you bring them into your project. But there&#8217;s also powerful services, for example pulling restaurants and photos people take in restaurants from Foursquare. You can integrate a service in a couple of days. It takes a lot longer to make everything work together smoothly, but the basic pieces can be pulled together so fast that a startup might only need one engineer to build its first product and show it. It might only need four months. It used to be that a startup always needed $6,000,000 minimum to get off the ground. The first startup I joined needed $6,000,000 and now people think that a couple $100,000 might get you off the ground. That&#8217;s more than an order of 10 drop and that is a game changer.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You can integrate a service in a couple of days.

Brianna Woo and Anita Sarkeesian. Twitter trolling happens publicly.  It always did used to happen, but it happened more in niches that fewer people could see. I&#8217;ve seen stories surface now about that happening 10 years ago. Where was the outrage 10 years ago? It apparently wasn&#8217;t surfacing high enough to be noticeable. I think that in the reaction to that, the backlash is happening because there&#8217;s pressure to change it for the better.

I don&#8217;t mind seeing big companies become better. I want to see Oracle become better and faster, and I still think there will be lots of room for small companies. It&#8217;s interesting to me how slow sometimes the adoption curve can be for something that, if you adopted it now, you&#8217;d be saving time within six months when the engineers are trained up, and yet five years pass before a company adopts that thing. There&#8217;s a saying in science, that science advances funeral by funeral. A generation of scientists has to be replaced by a new generation in order for a big idea to change the landscape and take over as the accepted idea. In my industry I think it&#8217;s the speed of hiring and firing—that a generation is how long people stay at a company.

When the services are down, you know it&#8217;s just a startup. It&#8217;s not 10 million people using it yet, so I don&#8217;t panic. I know people who panic in a startup because of being the only one there—the one in the spotlight. Well, I know people who panic at big and medium size companies too. But I actually think it&#8217;s more relevant when it&#8217;s a big company. Just because the blame can be spread more widely, doesn&#8217;t mean that an outage that affects 10 million people is better. It just has a bigger effect on the people who feel responsible. I&#8217;m able to put that in perspective when I work at a startup. It doesn&#8217;t have a lot of users yet, and so I say, &#8220;Okay, the system went down the weekend. We&#8217;ll write the tests to make sure it doesn&#8217;t happen again. No need to panic. Let&#8217;s just move on. Learn from it.&#8221;</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really have mentors that I can look up to and model myself on.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I see no reason why I won&#8217;t still be here in five or ten years. I would like to grow one of the startups that I join—and I know it&#8217;s never certain that I can do it—I would like to grow one of them to be a 200 person, a 300 person company. I want to be the CTO or VP Eng, one of the lead technical people. I don&#8217;t have to be the top. I can share responsibility very well. My co-founder in the last startup—we are excellent work partners. We fill in for each other’s weaknesses. I don&#8217;t do all the tech and he doesn&#8217;t do all the people stuff even though we obviously have strength in those directions. I could see myself sharing the responsibility at the top level of a company of 200 or 300. That&#8217;s where I&#8217;d like to be.</span></p>\n<p><b>Lastly, what advice would you give to folks from similar backgrounds who are in tech or hoping to get into it?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, I find it hard to generalize my advice. I do give advice to people and I try to pitch it to the person where they&#8217;re at. I met an intern from my alma mater and she must be about 21. She&#8217;s in San Francisco for a work term and my advice for her was that this is a great time to meet with people. Say, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to pick your brain. I&#8217;d like to have coffee, and I&#8217;d like to know what you&#8217;re doing. I&#8217;d like to know why you started that startup,&#8221; and so many people will say yes if you reach out. Every person you have coffee with, you could say: &#8220;This is so great talking to you. I like what you told me about this. Can you suggest somebody else I could talk to in this area?&#8221; and they&#8217;ll suggest two more names. So, you can just go on having coffee with fantastically interesting people every week, and you will find it so rewarding to build that experience and that breadth of mindset.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So that was my advice to a twenty-one year old, and my advice to a twenty-eight year old entrepreneur was to get bloody minded, to stop worrying about the things that weren&#8217;t the most important things or whether as the founder of the company she should be doing engineering hiring. I said, &#8220;Is it the most important thing? Can you do it right? It is your most important thing. You need to do it right. Be bloody-minded about that. Push the boundaries. Go hunt people down and hire them for your startup. You can&#8217;t do the normal things.&#8221; So I was telling her to push the boundaries, use the bloody-mindedness to work the problem of hiring the way she would work a problem in math.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My advice for somebody who&#8217;s thinking about becoming a mom is to flex it.  Be flexible in your picture of how things are going to be. Be flexible about whether you&#8217;re going to have a nanny or a daycare. Be flexible about whether you&#8217;re going to cook nutritious meals yourself every night or whether you can hire a cook or bring your kids to the company cafeteria. Be flexible about everything and always be reworking the problem. Every year with kids the situation changes. Flex it.</span></p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b></b><b>So let&#8217;s start from the beginning. Tell me about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m originally from San Francisco.  Actually I technically grew up in Millbrae, but I went to K-12 in the Sunset district of San Francisco. Most of my family is based here. I&#8217;m back in San Francisco after being gone for about ten years for college, grad school, and working as well. I’ve been back since late 2011.</span></p>\n<p><b>How did you first get interested in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I used to be a civil engineer &#8211; I worked in that industry for about four years and started to get really bored. I was doing a lot of repetitive work, and projects would last for years. I didn&#8217;t get to see the fruits of my labor as soon as I wanted, so I wanted to be in a space that used more innovative technology where I could see results faster. Based on what I was hearing it sounded like the tech industry was super fast-paced and that&#8217;s what I decided to transition into. I started to look for all types of jobs in tech and at the time, I thought I only qualified for customer support positions. I started working in customer support to get my foot in the door. It was really funny when I was applying because the company said,</span> “A civil engineer with a Master&#8217;s degree in mechanical engineering is applying to work in customer support: we think she might be overqualified.&#8221;</p>\n<p><b>Walk me through that transition, once you were in tech, working customer support, and teaching yourself how to code.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I worked in customer support at two companies, as a Community Manager and Customer Engagement Manager for about a year-and-a-half to two years. At one of those companies, I thought I wanted to do usability, but that didn&#8217;t end up panning out for me. I thought I wanted to continue working with people.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>“&#8217;A civil engineer with a Master&#8217;s degree in mechanical engineering is applying to work in customer support: we think she might be overqualified.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then I started to become interested in HTML and CSS because a friend of mine talked about building her own site and a site in Flash for a client as a side project. I decided to take a HTML and CSS workshop, which was about 12 hours in total. Eventually, I moved back to San Francisco without a job. During that time in addition to job searching, I started building a portfolio of art projects in HTML/CSS and posted that online. That was exciting and I thought it was super cool.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s when I took the Customer Engagement Manager role, which was more technical than the previous one. Customer Engagement Managers there had read access to a database, and I provided support regarding our HTML/CSS Craigslist templates and API. Our manager taught us how to write SQL queries so we could kind of view data, which really helped in customer support. I’d tried to learn Python and then I also tried to learn PHP because that company’s stack included PHP, but I didn&#8217;t take to either of those languages.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then one of my coworkers recommended I learn Javascript. You can run it in your browser and you can view your changes quickly. So I took another 12 hour workshop over a weekend with Girl Develop It and learned Javascript.</span> I started building all types of things and going to hack-a-thons, going to hack-nights, hanging out with more experienced programmers, and asking them a zillion questions. Eventually I transitioned from Customer Engagement Manager to Web Developer.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I started working on HTML emails, which are a horror, but a good place to start.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I started building all types of things and going to hack-a-thons, going to hack-nights, hanging out with more experienced programmers, and asking them a zillion questions. Eventually I transitioned from Customer Engagement Manager to Web Developer.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>How do you feel like your background in multiple disciplines affects how you work as a dev?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I definitely wouldn&#8217;t say I&#8217;m an expert. I like to say I’m a Jane of all trades, master of none. [laughter] Certainly </span>customer support affects the way that I work as a developer. Working mostly on the front end, I do think about our customers. I try to think of all types of people who might be using the platform instead of just thinking about people like me. That helps me as a developer &#8211; having empathy for people who might not be the most technically savvy or people who have qualities that might limit their interactions with websites.</p>\n<p>Working in civil engineering helped with developing a technical mind and thinking about things in a formulaic way.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> That really helps in programming in general. Also in all engineering disciplines, essentially create building blocks, which are more digestible and used to build larger blocks. Software Engineers called it abstraction, but Civil Engineers don’t have a term for it. Abstraction of formulas and calculations exists in civil engineering. That&#8217;s definitely translated over to the way that things work in Software Engineering realm.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Customer support affects the way that I work as a developer.

It&#8217;s funny: architects will create designs and then they pass that on to civil engineers who actually vet those designs with calculations. Designers create visual mocks and pass those onto developers, who build out the code. Equally true is the overlap within the industries themselves: architects and designers are often very technical, either knowing structures or writing code themselves; and civil engineers and developers often have an eye for design, throwing together what might be a great looking window or website.</span></p>\n<p><b>What about working in tech and in Silicon Valley has been really awesome for you? What are things you&#8217;re proud of?</b></p>\n<p>Being able to create my own projects out of thin air. The innovation and speed of innovation have definitely met my expectations for the industry. You can build a website overnight and I love that aspect of Tech. I guess that&#8217;s more personal. That what I do professionally, I can also use to produce personal projects is awesome &#8211; I have a lot of fun doing that.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m also so proud that one of my projects, (Human) Wasteland, became a political talking piece around homelessness in SF. I used programming skills I developed put the site up in just a week. The fact that a small, week old project could raise awareness about the lack of resources for those experiencing homelessness in San Francisco is so amazing! I still can’t believe that happened.</span></p>\n<p><b>What have been some of your biggest struggles or roadblocks?</b></p>\n<p>Coming from a non-traditional Computer Science background and being an “older” Chinese American woman in Tech has been interesting. There’s definitely unspoken bias. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since I&#8217;ve started working in tech, I’ve been the oldest person on all but two teams, the only woman on all but one team, and the only Asian woman on all of the teams. Some of those teams became more diverse and some became less diverse over time.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Coming from a non-traditional Computer Science background and being an &#8216;older&#8217; Chinese American woman in Tech has been interesting. There’s definitely unspoken bias.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>But&#8230; you&#8217;re not old at all.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know. I&#8217;m in my early thirties, so it&#8217;s kind of shocking, but really interesting. I think you kind of have to take it with a grain of salt.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I’m also frustrated when I think about what is being innovated in Silicon Valley. </span>Most of the innovation is going towards things that are built for the types of people who already work in the industry. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And I feel like having a more diverse team &#8211; or a more diverse workforce in the industry in general &#8211; would really help broaden the horizons of what the industry can actually do and what we could bring to the world outside of tech. But </span>right now there are so many apps that are just replicas of existing apps.</p>\n<p>The other day I conversed with coworkers about learning to cook and they said, &#8220;Oh there&#8217;s an app for that.&#8221;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Then they listed a number of apps that do exactly that or a slight spin on it, e.g., &#8220;Oh, do the chefs come to your place or do you go to the chef&#8217;s house?&#8221; That sort of thing. I find that extremely frustrating in tech.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Most of the innovation is going towards things that are built for the types of people who already work in the industry. The other day I conversed with coworkers about learning to cook and they said, &#8216;Oh there&#8217;s an app for that.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a lot of internal conflict: I want to do social good and use my skills to bring about change, but I still work in an industry where the majority of people don&#8217;t feel the same way. So that&#8217;s been a strange experience and personally hard to juggle or manage.</span></p>\n<p><b>You mentioned bias and microagressions in your pre-interview and I&#8217;m curious what that&#8217;s been like for you.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s interesting because </span>I think I&#8217;ve experienced racism and microaggression all of my life, but now that I&#8217;m older I notice it more. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you&#8217;re younger and it hasn&#8217;t happened as often, it&#8217;s easier to just brush off and not think about it. But as you become older and the more you experience it, the less tolerant of those issues you become. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s happened with strangers and it&#8217;s happened with friends. Usually, I</span> don&#8217;t think people intentionally try to hurt you. That almost makes it worse in a way, because they don&#8217;t even need to think about what they&#8217;re doing to you. People can just say things about race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, disability, or age without having to stop and think about it.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microaggression definitely affects the way you work: how you interact with coworkers or people in the industry and how you network. It can even affect your career. If you can&#8217;t work with those people who are saying racist or sexist things towards you or if you are not comfortable at work, then how do you further your career? How do you move up within a company? Or how do you move up within an industry if you&#8217;re being looked down upon? People don&#8217;t see you for your skills or your ability. They just see your race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, disability, or age.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ve experienced racism and microaggression all of my life, but now that I&#8217;m older I notice it more. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s happened with strangers and it&#8217;s happened with friends.

People can just say things about race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, disability, or age without having to stop and think about it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think this industry isn’t alone in its discrimination&#8211; it happens in so many industries. Civil engineering is somewhat similar, except most civil engineers are closer to the tech investor profile or archetype. In general, mostly older white males dominated civil engineering. So </span>I think discrimination and microaggression happens everywhere&#8211; it&#8217;s just now that I&#8217;m in tech, I definitely notice those problems more that before.</p>\n<p><b>You mentioned being the oldest person on your teams—do you experience ageism at 32?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[chuckles] I don&#8217;t think so, not super directly. I wouldn&#8217;t say ageism outright, but I think people in tech typically don’t consider people who are older or caretakers, or have families and obligations outside of work and partying. A lot of team bonding involves drinking or happens after work when people may need to go home and care for their children, parents, grandparents, etc. I&#8217;m at an age where I think, &#8220;Yeah, I don&#8217;t really want to drink every night.&#8221; So I think it&#8217;s more of a microaggression rather than actual, direct ageism.</span></p>\n<p><b>You also mentioned sexual harassment being an issue.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, sexual harassment has definitely occurred at multiple companies where I worked, but not always directly to me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first time it happened to me, I wrote a long article about it. I’m still surprised that it was allowed to happen. I don&#8217;t know if sexual harassment is worse in tech, but </span>I feel like when you have an industry that is predominantly young, male, focused on partying, and being the “fun” industry, all of those factors combine to create an atmosphere that almost encourages sexual harassment. At least in instances I&#8217;ve witnessed or personally experienced, alcohol was definitely involved. And those incidents occurred in the office, so I’m of the opinion that company culture and values make a huge difference.</p>\n<p>I also noticed that the people I know who have sexually harassed others have done it multiple times: repeat offenders. I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any way to fix this, but I wish there was some way to pass that information on because even if they’re punished, these people are just rehired because there&#8217;s such high demand for people in tech. Unfortunately, I think companies that once employed them are protecting themselves by not defaming those people when they get fired for sexual harassment.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this industry with the emphasis on partying and a “fun” atmosphere, people become friends. Everyone becomes super friendly. But when you lack a more professional atmosphere, people don&#8217;t want to call out, reprimand, or punish coworkers for sexual harassment.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I feel like when you have an industry that is predominantly young, male, focused on partying, and being the “fun” industry, all of those factors combine to create an atmosphere that almost encourages sexual harassment.

And those incidents occurred in the office, so I’m of the opinion that company culture and values make a huge difference.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>In my case of being sexually sexually harassed, I reported it.  I think I was one of the first employees to officially report it, but eventually found out that many of my coworkers knew about that dude’s history of sexual harassment and/or had been sexually harassed by him. Not only that, but when he was sexually harassing me and other women at the company, he was dating another coworker and lying about it. And the guy just got a slap on the wrist. He wasn’t fired, he was barely scolded.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s a super long story, but basically he went on to date one of the people whom he managed and used company resources to take her along to a conference, i.e., a company paid vacation. So it was just a super strange situation overall that was allowed to continue&#8211; nothing was ever done about it. He eventually quit of his own accord.</span></p>\n<p><b>Wow.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. People liked him and so they don&#8217;t want to fire him.</span></p>\n<p><b>That is nuts.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah [chuckles].</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;In my case of being sexually sexually harassed, I reported it.  I think I was one of the first employees to officially report it, but eventually found out that many of my coworkers knew about that dude’s history of sexual harassment and/or had been sexually harassed by him.

He was a great manager and helped push me towards software engineering without him even knowing it. He allowed me to handle all the technical support for our API and HTML and CSS Craigslist templates. That really really helped me in my development and towards my trajectory of becoming a software engineer. He could really pinpoint people&#8217;s skills and push them in that direction, and cleared roadblocks to help that happen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s funny: people have told me what he said about me as an employee and I heard that he said something along the lines of, “yeah, Jenn was kind of a pain in the ass.” Because I asked him for a lot&#8211; I was demanding as an employee but he was a great manager.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Many communities in Tech support people who are starting out and also people who are experienced. I learned JavaScript through Girl Develop It. Initially, that network was helpful for meeting other women, learning javascript, and staying involved. But there are tons of these networks: Girl Geek Dinners, Women Who Code, RailsBridge, PyLadies—you can really have your pick, and all these women have been extremely supportive.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And at the very beginning of transitioning into Web Development, there were so many friends and coworkers who were extremely helpful by just answering questions, steering me towards the right technologies, attending hack nights and hackathons with me, and encouraging me.</span></p>\n<p>Many communities in Tech support people who are starting out and also people who are experienced.

I found out about it via AdaCamp which was run by The Ada Initiative, which is sadly defunct. But AdaCamp was awesome&#8211; it really opened my eyes towards women in tech, acknowledging the issues that we face, and discovering that I’m not the only person deals with those problems. That was a really amazing experience. So joining Double Union was really great for me. Lots of wonderful, supportive, accomplished women are members that organization.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the last year or so, I spoke at a bunch of conferences and it&#8217;s been pretty crazy the last few years for me, being really immersed in tech.</span></p>\n<p><b>How does it feel being a San Francisco native who works in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a huge catch-22 [chuckles]. I love my job&#8211; I love being a software engineer. I really enjoy the work that I&#8217;m doing and learning new things every day. I also so lucky that the best place for me to find a job in my industry is in my hometown where all my family live. That&#8217;s also amazing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time,</span> the change that tech has brought in San Francisco makes me really sad. I recently talked with my boyfriend about how the archetype of San Francisco completely changed from when I grew up here.</p>\n<p>I feel like I&#8217;m part of the problem and also part of the solution. I wish that more people in tech cared more about people in the city outside of tech. I wish that they were more involved in community and building community, but I don&#8217;t feel that. Not in this industry. I feel like they only want to build community within tech or predominantly tech neighborhoods. It’s strange. After coming back here, the change was palpable and it&#8217;s only getting worse.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like I&#8217;ve been personally trying to get more involved in local community to be part of the solution. I pretty focused on homelessness currently, but also generally on politics. I&#8217;m a member of League of Women Voters and trying to be more involved.  I also try to inform people about the connection between tech and politics. For example, wealthy tech investors are often heavily involved in San Francisco and California politics and that’s typically bad for people in San Francisco. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also I&#8217;m involved in St. Francis Homelessness Challenge, run by former mayoral candidate Amy Farah Weiss. It&#8217;s basically a year-long challenge trying to provide resources and solutions for people who are experiencing homelessness. I&#8217;ve been trying to be more involved by volunteering for the Challenge.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The change that tech has brought in San Francisco makes me really sad. I feel like I&#8217;m part of the problem and also part of the solution.

I assume that’s difficult because most startups here run on borrowed money. They&#8217;re all running on money given to them by investors, so I suppose they kind of need to be greedy in order to become profitable. I don’t know the best thing to do in order to avoid that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certainly, giving back helps. I know many companies offer time off to employees so they can volunteer, but I know people in tech who leave and volunteer outside of San Francisco. So they’ve taken time off to volunteer in a community where they don’t live. Or they&#8217;ve gone to volunteer with the ASPCA, so they&#8217;re walking dogs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My high school in San Francisco required two types of volunteer work in order to graduate. 50 normal and 50 core hours. Core hours required you to be out in the community interacting with people in a very real and palpable way. For my core hours, I worked a weekend at St. Anthony’s, an organization that provides essential support to San Franciscans living in poverty. I served food to people, talked with them, and cleaned up afterwards. I also volunteered for Via Services, formerly Crippled Children’s Services. I worked at an overnight camp for people with disabilities and special needs. I helped organize activities and games, helped with cleaning, and general care giving and participation during my time there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the tech companies provide time-off to their employees, they should mandate that the time is spent on San Francisco’s people and communities, in other words, things that really matter and actually helped enrich the city. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another thing companies can do is educate their employees about what&#8217;s going on in San Francisco. I doubt something like that would happen though. There&#8217;s a crazy story by Pando Daily (https://pando.com/2015/10/26/conway/) that revealed Ron Conway emailed CEOs of companies he had invested in, telling them how to vote in the San Francisco November elections. Of course, you know he was saying, &#8220;Vote against Proposition F, the Airbnb law, and vote against Proposition I, the moratorium on housing in the Mission district,&#8221;. This is crazy and disturbing, but many people in tech who don&#8217;t even know about these things or how the companies they work for are funded by super corrupt people like that. I really do think education, knowledge, and awareness would be helpful in making a better city.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself here in 5 or 10 years. Are you still going to be working in tech? I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;ll still be living here.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, I think I&#8217;ll still be in San Francisco. Practically all of my family is here, so it’s really hard to leave. I have over 50 family members within the Bay Area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While applying to work for Eventbrite, I applied to work for 18F, which is basically a consultancy that lives inside the federal government. Their funding comes from the United States General Services Administration. 18F basically is contracted out by different agencies in the federal government to work on different websites and improve project management practices. So they’re all across the tech stack, helping the federal government function more efficiently and help citizens gain faster access to services.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m super interested in that: working in civil service and politics. Just doing software engineering for social good or working towards social good. That&#8217;s my ultimate goal.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, the timing of things didn&#8217;t quite work out for me because I&#8217;m relatively new to software engineering. I was looking for more face-to-face, in-person interaction and mentorship. And most 18F teams are distributed, so many employees work remotely. Sadly, I turned down the offer. But I think that could be in the future for me, assuming 18F is still around after this upcoming election&#8211; they better be!</span> I&#8217;m super interested in that: working in civil service and politics. Just doing software engineering for social good or working towards social good. That&#8217;s my ultimate goal.</p>\n<p><b>What kind of potential do you see in that space? Like what about that potentially is really exciting to you?  What would you like to see tech doing in that space? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s so much potential for improvement. There are agencies where many things are not even digitized yet. For example, when I hear about and see photos of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, I&#8217;m just so shocked and saddened by the state of things there. Knowing that soldiers are not receiving the benefits they need after training and fighting for this country, giving up years of their lives to do that work: I look at that and I think, &#8220;Wow, there&#8217;s so much that we could do. There&#8217;s so much that ordinary citizens can do to help all these other [chuckles] ordinary citizens all around us.&#8221; That&#8217;s really exciting to me because you/we have so much power to affect so many people in a more positive way.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Tech right now is so focused on money, investments paying off, and profitability. And I&#8217;m not interested in that. Getting paid well is awesome, but the fact that you could help people obtain health care, soldiers paid for the time they&#8217;ve put in for the country, helping immigrants settle and get legal help: that&#8217;s so much more exciting to me.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Tech right now is so focused on money, investments paying off, and profitability.

But, if I hadn&#8217;t been open to that, I probably wouldn&#8217;t be in the tech industry now.</p>\n<p>What you say yes to in order to transition into tech will often surprise you too! Working customer support really helped me empathize with customers and that makes me a much better engineer now. Be open to different possibilities or different paths. You don&#8217;t have to pay for a boot camp to learn software engineering, and you don&#8217;t have to be a software engineer in order to be in tech. Be open, be willing to do your research, and find other ways to get in the door. Especially for people who can&#8217;t afford to pay for boot camp or to take three unpaid months off.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For people who are feeling stuck in tech: many skillsets in tech cross over to lots of different industries. What my friend does as a business analyst is similar to what analysts do in tech. Be a business analyst in tech or be a business analyst in a ton of other industries. Design work also crosses over to a lot of different industries. Even engineering! My boyfriend&#8217;s mother actually started out in banking, then ended up running the computers there. She’s now a software engineer for another bank. But she could always go back to banking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re feeling stuck in tech, you should definitely get out (GTFO). Don&#8217;t continue working in the industry if you don&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s right for you. Anything&#8217;s possible. Of course, it really helps to have a safety net, so first make sure you have that safety net in place before you jump ship. But my overall advice is that you can absolutely use your skills towards other jobs in other industries. Tech is not the end all be all solution.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;My number one piece of advice is staying really open to whatever path may lead you to tech. I started out in tech as a customer support agent, and I feel like that&#8217;s one of the least glamorous ways: answering phone calls and emails from people asking how to change their password.

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m from Miami. My family family has four kids. I have an older brother, I have a twin sister, and I have a little sister. I did really well in school. I played sports: basketball, track. I went to college in Miami and then I went to law school at Florida State. I always liked tech, but it wasn&#8217;t a career when we were kids. There was War Games and Space Camp and movies about the craziness of hackers—how it could go horribly, horribly wrong, but it wasn&#8217;t a job that you could have. My elementary school—I was in a gifted program and they had a computer class—and I built a space game on a Commodore 64. Yeah, I&#8217;m dating myself. [chuckles] </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was really into tech when I was really young, but it wasn&#8217;t a thing you could do. And when I got to undergrad, that&#8217;s when email came out. I remember they were like, &#8220;You can have email.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;What the hell is email?&#8221; They were like, &#8220;You can write letters to people on the internet.&#8221; [chuckles] Napster was out then.  It was all kind of the early wild, wild west before Google.  And then when I went to law school, it was the first year they had a laptop requirement, and so we all had to get laptops, which was awesome. I downloaded the Mame arcade simulator, and so I just pressed F8 or whatever to put in quarters, and I&#8217;d be sitting in law school playing video games. It was awesome. [laughter]</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was really into tech when I was really young, but it wasn&#8217;t a thing you could do.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then I finished that and went to D.C. and got a Masters of Law, because I didn&#8217;t know what lawyers did day to day, and I wanted to be good at what I did before I started it. But it seems I educated myself into a bit of a black hole.  Instead of staying in D.C., I went back to Florida and no one knew what my degree was or what could be done with it, and nobody wanted to pay me to figure that out.  But I had classmates who had my degree and they got credit for an extra year of practice and got jobs at these big firms, and I couldn&#8217;t get interviews. It became very clear that people are kind of colorblind to a degree when you&#8217;re young because you&#8217;re in school and you&#8217;re not really a threat, but once you come back as an adult, things change. I wasn&#8217;t ready for that transition, my family wasn&#8217;t ready for it, and it caused some really difficult times.</span></p>\n<p><b>Wow.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. So then I practiced law for a while, which wasn&#8217;t what I ultimately wanted to do. I wanted to be a law professor, but I practiced for a while because my parents put their foot down after three degrees.  I needed to get a job.  So, I did practice but unfortunately I ended up working for people who saw the law as a business, not a profession. Which means that my ethics didn&#8217;t line up with theirs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And so I kept ending up in situations where people would think that I should be so happy that they gave me a job that I should do whatever they wanted me to do. But I had earned my position. I had three degrees. Like you didn&#8217;t just hand me the job. But just by virtue of who I was it just became a thing that, &#8220;Yeah. But who else is going to hire you?&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I kept ending up at these firms where they wanted to do things to make them richer at the expense of the clients. And at some point I was like, &#8220;You can continue going down the same path or you can do something different.&#8221; So, I decided to do education for a while.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And actually I had a pretty good time like with the students.  But once again I ran into some difficulties and ended up not being offered a position in 2008, which was the beginning of the recession.  If you got let go at that time, there was really no backstop. So, I ended up doing a couple different jobs, I was a personal trainer for 24 hour fitness [chuckles].</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I basically packed up all my things into four bags and took planes, trains, and automobile, all the way to L.A. I stayed with my twin for the holiday season, and I moved sight unseen to San Francisco with my unemployment check as my only source of income and started sending out applications.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Oh man.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. I did a variety of things. I was teaching at the Strayer, in their business law of department. I was teaching white collar business law and I looked at my book and I realized there were no lawyers who wrote it. I was like, &#8220;Why are there no lawyers in a white collar criminal law book?&#8221;  And I realized, it was because lawyers didn&#8217;t like business and businessmen didn&#8217;t like the law. So I was like, &#8220;Oh, well, maybe, I can fill that niche.&#8221; So, I went back to FIU and got a Masters in International Business.  I specifically went back to my undergrad because it&#8217;s an international focused university, and I wanted an opportunity to do an international internship. And I did that.  My last semester I had an internship in Scotland. I worked for a start-up—actually incubator high tech company that made holograms. Actual holograms.  Like, &#8220;Help me, Obi Wan, you’re my only help!&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>[ laughter] It&#8217;s insane. When I was working with them, they were a start-up, so I got to work on their website and stuff like that. I got into a little bit of HTML, and I was like, &#8220;This is kind of cool.&#8221;  When I came home, I had been thinking of this idea of a website.  Black Americans traveling internationally is a pretty new phenomenon in the numbers that we’re currently doing it. And a lot of us&#8211; because I&#8217;d done a couple of study abroads and every time I left the country, the whole community was like, &#8220;You&#8217;re going where?&#8221; [laughter] There&#8217;s an anxiety. And you can&#8217;t really say, &#8220;Oh well, he went or she went.&#8221; And it&#8217;s hard to point the elders to information. And you kind of just—you look like you’re just going out there on your own. I was like I should probably do a website for Black American travelers. So you can have basic information that you can share. That became my passion for a little while.  I created a website and it was a whole big thing, learning all the different coding and whatnot.  I did use a platform but still you have to learn some things on your own. I&#8217;d taken a position with an e-book publisher, so I learned more HTML and even some CSS. Just various things on how to structure content and whatnot. But I&#8217;d gotten to a point in my life and in my relationship at the time where things just weren&#8217;t working in Florida. I always try to come back to Florida to be successful because I&#8217;m from Florida. You see all these other people in your home doing these things, and you just want—this is my home, I want to be successful in my home.  But I finally reached a point where I had to realize it wasn&#8217;t going to happen. I&#8217;ve only been in California a year [chuckles]. I came here last January—actually the November before. I basically packed up all my things into four bags and took planes, trains, and automobile, all the way to L.A. I stayed with my twin for the holiday season, and I moved sight unseen to San Francisco with my unemployment check as my only source of income and started sending out applications.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was in hostels. Then, the week that I was supposed to receive my last unemployment check, I completely freaked out.  I was like, &#8220;I had no other backup.&#8221;  I couldn&#8217;t go back to Florida, I had nothing. So, I&#8217;m online, I&#8217;m looking, I&#8217;m looking, and I found a job meet-up that was hosted by the San Francisco LGBT Center. So, I walked from North Beach down to the San Francisco LGBT Center.  I had no idea how far it was. I get there, and it had already started, but they were cool and we talked. They said they&#8217;d help me with my resume. I came back the next day, and they helped me with my resume and I went back to the hostel, revamped it, and then I papered the entire Bay Area with it. The next day, I was supposed to come back and talk to a career counselor. And I wake up in the morning, I look at my phone, and I have an email from this dude at Google.com.  I almost fell out of my bunk! [laughter] Because I was like, &#8220;What? I didn’t apply to any jobs at Google.”  So, one of the jobs I&#8217;d applied for was for a vendor who worked on campus at Google. He was like, &#8220;Hey, can you have a phone interview on Monday?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yes!&#8221;  So the phone interview was cool. He asked me if I could get down to Google on Wednesday. I took a bus, and then the Caltrain, and then two buses. I couldn&#8217;t find my first bus stop when I got off the Caltrain, and so I was freaking out, and my friend in Florida is trying to Google map it for me, and it was a whole thing. I find the bus stop, get on the bus, get off, go get some food, and go stand at the second bus stop for twenty minutes like, &#8220;Oh, I have plenty of time.&#8221; And the bus comes like, &#8220;Oh, no, you&#8217;re supposed to be on the other side of the street.&#8221; Now, I&#8217;m freaking out like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to miss this interview!&#8221; Mind you, I&#8217;m right down the street from the campus, but I&#8217;ve never been, so I couldn&#8217;t tell. I just didn&#8217;t know.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t go back to Florida, I had nothing. So, I&#8217;m online, I&#8217;m looking, I&#8217;m looking, and I found a job meet-up that was hosted by the San Francisco LGBT Center. So, I walked from North Beach down to the San Francisco LGBT Center.  I had no idea how far it was. I get there, and it had already started, but they were cool and we talked.

The next day, I was supposed to come back and talk to a career counselor. And I wake up in the morning, I look at my phone, and I have an email from this dude at Google.com.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, the second bus comes, I get off and have to walk all the way to the edge of campus. But I actually got there fifteen minutes before my interview, after I&#8217;d already called the guy like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to make it on time!&#8221; And then I made it, and it was cool.  I had the interview and it went really well. I&#8217;m walking out and I was actually walking on Intuit’s campus because they&#8217;re across the street, and I was just walking around on the phone because it&#8217;s just beautiful. I get a phone call and I had to tell my friend, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to call you back because I&#8217;ve got a phone call.&#8221; And it was the recruiter saying they wanted to offer me the job and I was like, &#8220;What?&#8221; This was the day I received my last unemployment check. [chuckle] I got offered the job as a vendor at Google. The next day I got on a megabus and headed right to my sister’s in L.A. and just vegged out for two weeks. She was like, &#8220;You can just stay here.&#8221; It was great, and I started, but even then it took a while to get up and running. I still didn&#8217;t have housing together, that took a while. The first place I got housing I signed a six month sublease, and then in three months my sub-lessor [chuckle] contacted me and was like, &#8220;Yeah, so the lease is up.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;What?&#8221; &#8220;Yeah, you need to get out this month.&#8221; That was tough and it was just a variety of different things like that that kept popping up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I ended up actually having to leave Google because the prospects for long-term employment had gotten kind of iffy. Not that it wouldn&#8217;t have happened, but their time frame was a lot longer than mine. I had uprooted my whole life. I wasn&#8217;t really in a position to be in a wait-and-see kind of attitude. So I took the opportunity to go to Yahoo, which was terrifying [chuckles] because all of my friends were at Google. It&#8217;s the first place I called home since I left home. It was the family that I made in California. But I went to Yahoo, and almost immediately upon entering Yahoo as a contractor, they interviewed me for an FTE position. And about two weeks into January, I signed my contract for an FTE position. I started my Google contract position February 23rd of last year, and I was scheduled to start my Yahoo full-time position February 13th of this year.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Wow.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was.  The difference a year can make is extraordinary.  But, unfortunately, Yahoo fell apart about a week after our initial interview and my job went with it.  They called the day my background check cleared and rescinded my contract.  It was devastating.  A body blow.  It shook my entire network.  Like, I had come to California to change my life and I made it happen all in one year.  And one phone call snatched the rug from under me, under all of us, yet again.  It’s hard to keep getting up.  And, if there was ever a moment where that was a question, this was it.  But, I think my fighter is hard-wired.  Like she can go on auto-pilot when all of my other systems shut down.  So, I somehow managed to apply for a few jobs during the devastation.  And my circle held me up.  My sister and my girlfriend particularly.  The Monday after the news, my girl ended up spending the day with me.  And we went for a walk in the park.  It was such a nice day out, sunny and warm, and it just healed me some.  Like, I was still hurt, but I wasn’t shattered anymore?  Like I could move forward. And that week a recruiter contacted me.  We had a really good phone interview about a job that wasn’t for me.  And she told me she also recruited for Google and asked if I wanted to go back.  And I told her “With all my heart and soul.”  Because when you take a blow like that, you just want to go home.  And Google is my home here.  So, we found a position I liked, I interviewed and I got it.  I’ve been there for a few weeks now and it’s different, like when you move back with your parents after college [chuckles].  But it’s good.</span></p>\n<p><b>So how it&#8217;s been? Has tech lived up to your expectations? What are your first impressions?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, it is difficult when you start at Google, is what I&#8217;ve learned. Google is tops. It really—it doesn&#8217;t get much better, in my experience. I clearly come from a very difficult background, employment-wise. It doesn&#8217;t matter how intelligent I am, or how hard I worked, there was always a problem. And Google was the first place that I&#8217;ve worked where no one gave a shit. No one cared at all. And it was funny because I was actually sitting in one of the cafes one day, and a whole bunch of new Googlers—Nooglers—were coming off of a bus, and the first guy looked at me and was like—and you could see him running his training in his head like, “if she&#8217;s here, she&#8217;s supposed to be here.”  And I&#8217;m watching them all walk by and have this same conversation in their heads.  I know that it seems like they shouldn&#8217;t have to do this, but thank god they do. I&#8217;ve never been in a position where people self-corrected. When they recognized that they had felt something unreasonable and then fought themselves to make it right. I just felt that was brilliant. It&#8217;s not utopia, everywhere has difficulties but considering where I’ve come from, I could not have landed at a better place. My time at Yahoo was good but for different reasons. There was opportunity at Yahoo. There were things that I could do, things that I could bring to the company. But cultural wise, it&#8217;s a little more difficult because there wasn&#8217;t much diversity on campus. I didn’t have the self-correction thing. I had more just open stares&#8211;</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I clearly come from a very difficult background, employment-wise. It doesn&#8217;t matter how intelligent I am, or how hard I worked, there was always a problem.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>You mentioned that.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During my first week or so there, people just kept walking by my desk and looking at me, to reassure themselves that I&#8217;d still be there. There aren&#8217;t a lot of black people, and then I don&#8217;t resemble the ones they&#8217;re comfortable with. I used to have permed hair, I was a lawyer and would wear heels and suits and whatnot. I&#8217;m much older now and at this point, you&#8217;re going to be who you&#8217;re going to be. So I wear my little t-shirts and long sleeves [chuckles], and I wear my hair natural. And there just aren&#8217;t a lot of people like me at Yahoo. So it&#8217;s not hostility. It&#8217;s more discomfort, but it was disconcerting and really affected my decision to accept the FTE position. Because if I&#8217;m not there, then who&#8217;s there? So the culture can use a little help [chuckles], but the opportunities were there. So it was a balance. I&#8217;ve been in outright hostile situations more often than not. So a little bit of, &#8220;Oh my god, she works here?&#8221; I mean I could do without it, but it&#8217;s not going to destroy it for me [chuckles]. At this point, it&#8217;s a lot better than what I&#8217;ve seen before.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Even in New York, people would stare at me. And I was like, &#8216;There&#8217;s a guy painted silver down the street. Why am I interesting?'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>It&#8217;s a blessing almost for you to be able to have that perspective, but I hate that it has to happen in the first place. You know what I mean?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, and it&#8217;s a hard fought blessing because in my twenties, it would have been different. But in my twenties it was new and raw, I was struggling with it a lot more. So to come here at this age, and for it to be this kind of struggle—I&#8217;m comfortable with it. So I kind of feel like all of the out-and-out fighting [chuckles] I basically did to hold onto my humanity on the East Coast kind of prepared me for the questioning looks of the West Coast. It&#8217;s just things are softer here. It&#8217;s not like the issues don&#8217;t exist, but people don&#8217;t tend to take it as far as obviously. It&#8217;s more abject curiosity. It&#8217;s funny because there are a lot of minorities in tech, they&#8217;re just not American minorities. It&#8217;s like, if you can accept minorities from other countries, why can you not accept your own? It&#8217;s the number one issue that I&#8217;ve had with Silicon Valley. We don&#8217;t ever seem to have a problem with the amount of women from other countries. We don&#8217;t ever seen to have a problem with brown people from the opposite side of the globe. But when you see a black person in tech or you see a program for Latinos in tech, then suddenly people are up in arms and, &#8220;Why are we handing out this and handing out that?&#8221; It&#8217;s like there&#8217;s an assumption that if people come from other countries, then they must have done something to make it. If minorities come from here, they must have been given something. I have four degrees from very good universities, so clearly no one gave me anything. You may have given me opportunity, but no one&#8217;s handing me my job. The fact that I don&#8217;t get the same credit, just to start, is frustrating. This is the life story for black women in this country for decades. So, just like those before us, you&#8217;re just kind of hoping that if you continue to do what you do, then maybe it will be easier for the next.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s funny because there are a lot of minorities in tech, they&#8217;re just not American minorities.

You have degrees in multiple disciplines. You&#8217;re so well-rounded and you come from the other side of the country, like myself. You didn&#8217;t go down the typical path at all. More and more, there are conversations around how being unique and being different makes you such an asset, in terms of contributing to a team or bringing perspective to a product. How do you think that impacts your approach to work and makes you bring something to the table?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. Well, I&#8217;ve always been a contributor. I enjoy being on a team. I appreciate that dynamic. My first stint at Google my diversity in intelligence, I guess, made me a leader.  Amongst my group at least, because they appreciated that I could see different sides of an argument, and because it makes it—I become like a translator. Especially since my first Google team—my first team at Google, there was me, a woman from Japan, a woman from Brazil, and an American girl with—she worked with the Canadian market.  So we all had very different understandings of the same sentence, and I could understand all of their understandings, and help them explain them to each other. And so I tend to bring value in that aspect, and people tend to be open to that. As far as it translating into a wider contribution to the company, that&#8217;s more difficult, because people are rightfully to some degree concerned about their position, and there&#8217;s always a difficulty because people think that you have the same motivations they have. And so people who are motivated by position are always concerned about other people trying to take theirs. If you have a good idea, or a good approach or something like that nature, they&#8217;re more concerned with how it affects them ultimately. &#8216;Will she come take my spot?&#8217; But that&#8217;s a position I&#8217;ve always been in so I&#8217;m very comfortable with that&#8211; people thinking that way. It&#8217;s unfortunate, but that&#8217;s what my norm has been. I value Google. I value Yahoo. I value these companies that play a daily role in my life. For me it&#8217;s not really about, &#8216;Oh, if I do this I get to move here or do this?’ No, it&#8217;s about, &#8216;If we make Yahoo stronger it helps all of us.&#8217; Yahoo seemed to be pretty open to using me in a variety of ways. I’ve only been back at Google for a few weeks but from the conversations we&#8217;ve had thus far, they&#8217;re open to using the talent I have in the ways that best benefit the company. That&#8217;s why I value Google, because that&#8217;s a philosophy I can believe in. We&#8217;ll have to see if it follows through, but I don&#8217;t really have much reason to believe that it doesn&#8217;t. The people who are in charge of that type of thing seem to have the mindset that I agree with, and the people who have difficulty with it don’t seem to be in my chain of command.  So, I&#8217;m not so concerned. It seems that at least in my department, the people at the top are pretty comfortable with who and what they are, and so they&#8217;d be willing to allow me to help the company when the opportunity presents itself.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I have four degrees from very good universities, so clearly no one gave me anything.

And I was miserable. And I didn&#8217;t get any of those things that I’d worked so hard for. The expectations were still there from one side, but people still saw me how they wanted to see me from the other, and I never received any benefit. You can only beat your head up against the wall for so long, and so then I was like, “Well, let me try and find an arena that doesn&#8217;t make me fight so hard for my humanity,” and I felt like tech was it. And it has been. While I was still a contractor at Yahoo, they still allowed me some input into some arenas that I didn&#8217;t expect. They actually took my input legitimately and forwarded it through proper channels and treated me as if my ideas mattered. And that&#8217;s the thing that I liked about Yahoo at the time, that that they still had the capacity to see human beings. It wasn’t a machine, there was still a human component. I think as long as they manage to keep that, they still have a fighting chance. </span></p>\n<p><b>At work, do you have kind of a support network that keeps you grounded, or do you find that elsewhere? Like the LGBT community that you were involved with when you first got here?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was actually heavily involved with LGBT ERG at Google, which is interesting because a lot of tech companies in Silicon Valley don&#8217;t allow vendors and contractors to be involved in their groups, which I think is really unfortunate. But I found a home with the Gayglers. A lot of them are still my friends, and a lot of the people who I worked with when I started are still my friends. At Yahoo, I made some more relationships. A couple of people I started friendships with. But I didn&#8217;t spent as much time on their campus in that way.  I hadn&#8217;t connected with their LGBT community, but between my old Google friends, my newer Yahoo friends, my girlfriend, and hopefully new Google friends. [chuckle] I actually met my girlfriend at Google as well.</span></p>\n<p><b>Oh, really? Oh, man! It&#8217;s like you just found treasure as soon as you got here.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was like the perfect place for me to start. I couldn&#8217;t—it wasn&#8217;t the place for me to grow at the time, but it was the place for me to get on my feet. And I will always appreciate it for that. Everywhere can&#8217;t be everything. I think I needed to be there to get a floor, to get a family, you know a home? But then, I had to branch out just like you do when you&#8217;re a kid. At some point you have to leave home, try to create something bigger for myself.</span></p>\n<p><b>I really respect that. I think a lot of people a lot of people take the safe—they just stick around. You know?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Comfortable isn&#8217;t always safe and that&#8217;s what I was concerned with. Towards the end of my first Google gig, we were comfortable, but we didn&#8217;t feel safe. I felt like I could stay here and ultimately lose it all, or I can make this leap and possibly gain a whole lot. And it seems I made the right decision.</span></p>\n<p><b>Have you had mentors, people that you know or you don&#8217;t know people that have inspired you on your path?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My twin inspires me, she always has. Our family is very competitive, and my twin is very smart, but I&#8217;m Very smart. In our family dynamics it was always difficult. She would study really hard and would get a B, and I would play around and scan the book last second and get an A. That&#8217;s tough. I don&#8217;t think she realized that I noticed that. Obviously I wouldn&#8217;t have felt guilty, this was in high school and middle school, but it wasn&#8217;t that I didn&#8217;t understand that our situations were different. I always kind of wanted her to get what she deserved or be what she wanted. She worked so hard. She went through, for several years she wanted to be a model, so I used to help her with that dream and whatever dreams she had. Recently, she actually published a book. She had her own launch party and it was awesome. It&#8217;s a dream that she&#8217;s been working on for seven years. I would edit it, then she&#8217;d pay to have it edited then she paid for a book cover, and images, and this, that, and the other. My whole life she has worked hard to pursue different dreams and I watched her. Even when they didn&#8217;t go the way she wanted, she never just quit. She never just said, &#8220;Well, I guess that didn&#8217;t work.&#8221; She would just find another dream and pursue that one. I was always inspired by her ability to keep going. When it got difficult for me, I didn&#8217;t necessarily look back on that example but I think I always had a little bit of it in me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the last maybe ten years or so, we&#8217;ve gotten pretty close, and she&#8217;d call and check-in at the most opportune times [chuckles]. Just encouraging words to keep me moving. She had been trying to get me to leave Florida for some time. The last time I went down and it didn&#8217;t work out she was over it [chuckles], and so when I actually decided to go, she was all—&#8221;You need to come, you need to come here. It looks like you need to come here.&#8221; When I got the job as a vendor at Google, I couldn’t work out the housing situation since I wasn&#8217;t getting paid anymore, and she was like, &#8220;You can just stay here for a couple of weeks. My roommate will be fine. You’ll just sleep on the couch.&#8221; Even when I started working there, I still had to get finances together and get housing, and she would send me a little money here or there or talk to me and keep me focused. And  basically she&#8217;s kept me from being a hothead over the last two years, which is a thing. I&#8217;m not just generally a hothead, but once I hit a point, I&#8217;ve hit that point, and she&#8217;ll talk me down and like, &#8220;Look, this is where you were, this is where you are. I know this is difficult, but this is where you are, and it&#8217;s better than where you were, so breathe, relax, and then you can make a decision.&#8221; She said that a lot over the last year, year-and-a-half. I can&#8217;t say that I have any mentors in the tech community or anything like that, but having her in my corner has been—it&#8217;s a lifetime thing. She&#8217;s given me a path to follow and she&#8217;s a positive voice in my ear and I need it.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m very excited about the ability of tech companies, since they have the resources and they have the ability to train and they have the people flooding their gates.

What are you excited about, and what really frustrates you and what do you want to see change?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m excited about the possibilities of—when I was in business school, they talked about transnational corporations. And it&#8217;s like a new form of corporate entity, how you do business, how you see the world. And it&#8217;s really only possible if you, like a tech company, bring people in from all over the world and make a global focus your focus. So it&#8217;s not about diversity as in this many people of these people and this many of these people. It&#8217;s a diversity that&#8217;s bigger than that. It&#8217;s diversity of thought, diversity of focus, and how you approach problems in situations. So I&#8217;m very excited about the ability of tech companies, since they have the resources and they have the ability to train and they have the people flooding their gates. They really do have the ability to pick and choose a workforce that can be anything they want it to be, and to create a corporation unlike any that you&#8217;ve seen.

And allowing those people too much time and too much power can ultimately destroy an organization. You lose your focus. You lose your good people. And it scares me because it happens when it doesn&#8217;t have to. Companies that don’t necessarily need to cut cost, use contractors with completely opposing visions to cut cost. But you don&#8217;t need to cut cost. So why would you affect your work pool in that way? And so I see talented people moving from company to company to company, because the vision that they thought the company had when they came in was not the reality the C-suite built. And so I&#8217;m talking to different friends of mine who work in different tech companies, and the atmospheres are not what people outside of tech think they would be. We have this idea of, everyone was a nerd, so why would there be bullies? All of us got overtalked in high school and elementary school, so why would we overtalk people? You figure that this would be the one arena where you would know how to treat people, and care to treat them that way. And that&#8217;s the dream of Silicon Valley, for all of us who are coming from wherever, when we come here. But then we get here, and it feels a lot like the East Coast, and that&#8217;s demoralizing. Because if we can&#8217;t be better in Silicon Valley, we can&#8217;t be better. Where else in this country are we ever going to have this opportunity where there are enough resources, enough jobs, and enough companies with missions that aren&#8217;t just money-focused? There&#8217;s nowhere else in this country where we have this ability to be better. So if we can&#8217;t do it here, it speaks for all of us. And it&#8217;s scary. And so that&#8217;s—my biggest fear is that we won&#8217;t recognize that we can do better, and we&#8217;ll be mean girling in the cafeteria at a tech company in Silicon Valley, when all of us grew up on the other side of that. There shouldn&#8217;t be a place for that here. This is really our only safe haven, pretty much tech and academics, and if those two go down, then there&#8217;s no safe space for the square pegs and that&#8217;s a scary proposition.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;If we can&#8217;t be better in Silicon Valley, we can&#8217;t be better.

And it&#8217;s scary when you think we may get more of that than what we expected, you know?</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. I&#8217;ll be curious to see what happens. I worked in tech for a few years, and six years ago, it was way more— it felt way more weird.

I shouldn&#8217;t stick out at all, you know [laughter]? I really shouldn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s the whole idea. That was what I loved about when I first got to LA. No one looked at you. Even in New York, people would stare at me. And I was like, &#8220;There&#8217;s a guy painted silver down the street. Why am I interesting?&#8221; But when I first got to LA, no one cared at all. And I just thought it was the greatest thing ever—that I could just be.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yep.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But more and more, I&#8217;m becoming a thing again, and that is not what I expected.

I don&#8217;t know how long it&#8217;s been going on because I&#8217;ve only been here a year, but I’ve felt it in the time that I&#8217;ve been here. And that&#8217;s disconcerting.</span></p>\n<p><b>Going back to something you talked about earlier. People talk a lot about the hiring problem and the pipeline problem and the addressing diversity issue from a hiring perspective, but I&#8217;m also really interested in retention. And that&#8217;s not talked about quite as much. You&#8217;ve got people coming to the industry. They&#8217;re coming, but you&#8217;re losing them, like you said. I&#8217;m curious to hear your thoughts as someone who has this perspective in consulting and business strategy, and your thoughts around how are folks missing the mark in terms of talent retention.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They&#8217;re making it too complicated. It&#8217;s not that hard. Just don&#8217;t make me feel like I&#8217;m not supposed to be here. I&#8217;ve worked at two pretty big tech companies at this point. And the biggest difficulty that I&#8217;ve seen is most of the diversity is going to be in your contractor and vendor pool. There are more Black people working as contractors and vendors at Google than as FTEs. There are more of us working as contractors at Yahoo than working for Yahoo. So a lot of these companies don&#8217;t necessary have an issue with minorities. But they create a pretty clear line between contractors and FTEs, which creates a separation between your largely minority force and your largely majority force. And so you end up in a situation where everyone who looks like me is probably a contractor, so nobody pays attention to you. And you end up with full-time employees who are treated like contractors because that&#8217;s what people see. If the majority of the contractors are minorities, and the majority of FTEs aren’t, then &#8220;If you&#8217;re a minority, you must be a contractor, I don&#8217;t have to pay attention to you.&#8221; So it&#8217;s a structural way of internalizing these attitudes and beliefs that we didn&#8217;t intend to foster. There&#8217;s no real need for that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I mean, your contractors work for you. You can&#8217;t do your business without them. They&#8217;re not necessarily less intelligent. I know that because I have four degrees and I&#8217;m a contractor, so clearly we&#8217;re not inferior beings.  But the issue is the need to create an entitled position socially. You already have stock options. You can go to the health center. There are already things that you can do that contractors can&#8217;t do. So, the fact that you have to create this &#8216;we&#8217;re better than you&#8217; atmosphere necessarily injects some level of discrimination into your company that didn&#8217;t have to be there. I mean, it&#8217;s one thing to have different badges. No one really cares until it becomes a thing, until I&#8217;m walking on campus and I see someone look at my badge color before they say hi to me or don’t say hi to me. Or before they walk past me like they don&#8217;t see me. Those things aren&#8217;t necessarily racist when they&#8217;re set up, but if I am one of less than 2% of black people on your force, but your contractors have plenty of black people, all of a sudden now I am an &#8216;other&#8217; because everyone thinks that I must be a contractor. It just makes it more complicated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just have your work force treat everyone like they&#8217;re okay. Say hi to anybody that walks past you. Speak when you&#8217;re spoken to.  Just basic human sensibility, and you can keep your minorities. Nobody&#8217;s asking for extra. Nobody wants a handout. Nobody needs special treatment. We just don&#8217;t want to be treated poorly. I think there&#8217;s this anxiety around the issue, and it makes people do a whole lot of things, but they don&#8217;t do the basics. So you&#8217;re having these courses, and you&#8217;re having these talks, and oh, let&#8217;s have a seminar, and a symposium, and let&#8217;s do this, and write this article, but when you walk around campus, do you say hi to each other? When you&#8217;re sitting in a meeting, do you notice when someone has something to say? When they say that thing, do you actually listen to it, and comment based on what they said, or do you just run through it like they didn&#8217;t say anything at all? Just basic human sensibility will make people want to work for you. But when you make it us versus them, then it&#8217;s more complicated, and then you have to try to force people. &#8220;Don&#8217;t treat these people worse than&#8230;&#8221; And so now people are actively trying to be overly friendly, which is also disingenuous, nobody wants that. I don&#8217;t want you to say hi to me because I&#8217;m the black chick. I want you to say hi to me because I&#8217;m on campus and I looked you in your face. That&#8217;s just basic. We manage, but it&#8217;s this whole&#8211; I work for, you work at, and that sense of entitlement has permeated all the Tech companies that I have even spoken to my friends about. And all those Tech companies have diversity issues.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that hard. Just don&#8217;t make me feel like I&#8217;m not supposed to be here.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Whoa. That&#8217;s just like a totally new systemic issue to me that is blowing my mind right now. It&#8217;s almost like, it&#8217;s creating—and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s not on purpose, but it&#8217;s created the system in which discrimination can be quietly applied to an area of tech that is not necessarily stigmatized and that&#8217;s crazy. It&#8217;s crazy.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you remember the situation where minorities are afraid to speak to other minorities? Because it&#8217;s like, &#8220;If I speak to you and you&#8217;re a contractor, they&#8217;re never going to believe I’m not a contractor.&#8221; Now you&#8217;ve created dissention within the minority groups because nobody wants to be connected to someone who is lower than them because people already want to think that they&#8217;re lower. So it&#8217;s just highly unnecessary, just speak, just work, just be kind to one another. It&#8217;s not that complicated. Teach manners in these intro classes. Teach cross-culture communication. People who grew up in this area think of things this way, the east coast sees it this way, the west coast see it this way, this country sees it this way, that country sees it that way. Know that while everyone won&#8217;t fit into those individual groups or sets, you may want to be cognizant that people from this country may speak about things in this light, or it may be more effective to explain it this way. Just teach people how to communicate with each other, and how to be kind and people will stay. We like our jobs, everyone who comes here likes their job. We just don&#8217;t want to be tortured and we don&#8217;t want to be a zoo animal. [chuckle] We don&#8217;t want to be petted, randomly, by people who think it&#8217;s their job to pet you. We just want to be a human and go to work every day. That&#8217;s all you want to do. It takes an effort in communication and understanding that everyone here deserves to be here. No one&#8217;s handing out jobs, to anyone, from anywhere.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Just have your work force treat everyone like they&#8217;re okay. Say hi to anybody that walks past you. Speak when you&#8217;re spoken to.  Just basic human sensibility, and you can keep your minorities. Nobody&#8217;s asking for extra. Nobody wants a handout. Nobody needs special treatment. We just don&#8217;t want to be treated poorly.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Lordy. People are treating it like it&#8217;s a zero-sum game. You are not taking something from someone, by being present.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is also a difficulty.  The, &#8220;Oh well if we hire these people there&#8217;ll be less of—&#8221; No there won&#8217;t. There are still jobs, they&#8217;re still hiring. I hate the argument every time you say, let&#8217;s diversify. People say, “well we don&#8217;t want to lower our standards.” Did you lower your standards for me? Because I believe that I out-degree most of the people at my company. So it’s just this automatic assumption that we need a handout when it&#8217;s not that. The issue is, I have 4 degrees but I may have never been interviewed. How many people like me are out there because you want to interview people who you know and you understand and you feel comfortable with? Well, for the good of the company, maybe you should expand who you know, who you understand, and who you feel comfortable with. I’ve spent a lot of time traveling. I&#8217;m comfortable with pretty much anyone, pretty much anywhere.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;How many people like me are out there because you want to interview people who you know and you understand and you feel comfortable with? Well, for the good of the company, maybe you should expand who you know, who you understand, and who you feel comfortable with.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of people don&#8217;t travel.  Or they&#8217;ll travel with their friends to specific places that feel an awful lot like home.  So you don&#8217;t actually get a view of the world or meet different people or learn different things. It&#8217;s not that you&#8217;re actively not hiring women or any other minorities, it&#8217;s that you don&#8217;t know them and you can&#8217;t communicate with them. So you&#8217;re afraid of them and you&#8217;d rather not have them in your closer circles. That&#8217;s why teaching basic communication, teaching basic human kindness would make it easier to hire and to retain minorities of all sorts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s is some media syndrome and I don&#8217;t think we understand it. You see it every day when you check Facebook. It&#8217;s like people feel like it gives them some sort of, I don&#8217;t know, intelligence credit. If they can just shoot people down and be hateful all the time. It&#8217;s like a new badge of honor of some sort, you know to be mean and unreasonable and just to hate [chuckle] for absolutely no reason. I don&#8217;t understand it. Life is really short, like really short. And I can&#8217;t waste time for any of it. I won&#8217;t waste time for any of it. I think by the time some of these people realize how short life is, they will have blown quite a bit of it. Just wasting life experience.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. I don&#8217;t think it works long term. I&#8217;m not convinced.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[chuckle] Maybe you won’t become a bitter old person. When I was in high school we were having a school function outside at my high school and I think there were older people.  I was standing outside waiting for my mom to pick me up, and a couple of them walked out and they were nice and they said hi or whatever. But two or three of them were just mean, just went out of their way to be mean to me because I was the youth and I was this and that, you know “kids these days.” And I was like, &#8220;How are you this bitter when you&#8217;re this old? Have you always been bitter?&#8221; But it&#8217;s just a horrible way to live. It&#8217;s like, even if you&#8217;re physically kind of crippled as an older person, if you&#8217;re kind, it changes the whole appearance of your face. It changes how the room feels when you&#8217;re in it, and I would rather go out like that than cussing the gods [chuckles] with my last angry breath. It just doesn&#8217;t seem to be worth it. Especially since you work in tech. How bad can it be [chuckles]? Really? This is like Disney World. How bad can your life be? They pay good salaries. The housing is expensive, but it&#8217;s nice. You can afford it on your salary. The food is good. You can get organic and whatever special stuff that you crave for a reasonable price. They will deliver anything from anywhere to your door at any point in time. You can go off the grid or use Google&#8217;s fiber or their phone service or anything else, anything that you want is within a dial of your phone. Wow, why so angry? [chuckles]</span></p>\n<p><b>I so understand. I think perspective helps.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, I think it does.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you think you&#8217;ll be in five or ten years? Do you think you&#8217;ll still be here?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, no [laughter]. No, I&#8217;ve got plans. I wanted to do tech for a long time, and I have a set period of time that I want to spend specifically in tech solely. But I had dreams before I came here. So this was a dream that I wanted to fulfill, but it&#8217;s not my ultimate dream. Well, part of it was. Working at Google was an ultimate dream, but I’ve done that. So that&#8217;s cool [chuckles]. But yeah, I have things that I want to do with my life once this phase is over.  I&#8217;m not a lifer, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever truly leave tech. I was always kind of in it anyway. So this is a very important chapter in my life, but it won&#8217;t be the only one.</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m excited to see what happens, what you end up doing. My last question for you was going to be what advice would you have to people who face similar struggles to you who are hoping to get into tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&#8217;t listen to anyone or anything. Well, listen, but always give yourself the final say. I don&#8217;t have a single tech degree [chuckles]. I came here to do a General Assembly course in UX design and it all fell apart when I was on the train in Texas because I couldn&#8217;t find housing. But I&#8217;m still here and now I&#8217;m in my second stint at Google with greater responsibilities. So it is possible.  If you&#8217;re willing to put in the work it is possible. You may have to go a different route. You may have to do some different things, but just don&#8217;t let someone else dictate to you the path that you need to take to be here. I had several people who I was trying to have as mentors who tried to tell me, &#8220;Do it this way, do it this way,&#8221; but they weren&#8217;t ways that fit what I wanted for my career and for my life. And I appreciated that they were trying to help me, but I had to do it my way, and I&#8217;m very happy that I did. Oh, and it will not be easy.  There will be traps and pitfalls, the rug may even get pulled more than once.  You can’t help what happens to you.  If you get hit hard enough, you will fall.  But you can control how you fall.  Always fall forward.  Take the blow.  Allow yourself the hurt.  But never go backwards.  Fight to fall forward and you’ll always have a reason to get up.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You can’t help what happens to you.  If you get hit hard enough, you will fall.  But you can control how you fall.  Always fall forward.  Take the blow.  Allow yourself the hurt.  But never go backwards.  Fight to fall forward and you’ll always have a reason to get up.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Why don&#8217;t we start from the beginning? Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I&#8217;m from Virginia originally. I have always done fine arts my entire life, as long as I can remember. Then, in high school I was introduced to graphic design. I think illustration will always be my first love, and I thought design would be a good route to follow for that. I went to college for graphic design, the program I was in was very print-design oriented. After college, I worked at a pretty small creative agency in Richmond, Virginia. Pretty much within a year of being in the industry there you work with everyone you&#8217;re ever going to work with there because it&#8217;s just so small. At some point, I visited the Bay Area with some friends. I really liked it and I was like, &#8220;At this point I could go to New York or San Francisco, I guess I&#8217;ll try San Francisco [chuckles].&#8221; I really wanted to live in a big city and NY and SF felt like the only options to me. I also wanted to live far away. I didn&#8217;t really understand the implications and impact of moving to the Bay Area. I knew that “tech” was happening but I was very isolated from the culture of tech. I didn’t know anyone in tech but I guess that’s really my bad for being naïve and not doing my research. By the time I was in it, it was too late. I was like, &#8220;Oh, shit. I’ve spent so much time and energy breaking into this new industry and now I&#8217;m in this industry that&#8217;s really problematic.&#8221; Not that any of the other ones are any better, but, I don&#8217;t know, if you want to be doing big work, I feel like in design, tech is where you want to be. That&#8217;s how I guess I ended up where I am at now. It&#8217;s not to say that I don&#8217;t like tech, I really like designing and illustrating for screens and tech brands but the culture around it is so toxic.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I knew that &#8216;tech&#8217; was happening but I was very isolated from the culture of tech. I didn’t know anyone in tech but I guess that’s really my bad for being naïve and not doing my research. By the time I was in it, it was too late.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>I definitely want to dig into that with you. I&#8217;m curious, as someone who also grew up in a small town in the south, what it was like for you growing up? Especially as someone who eventually came out as queer?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My dad was a pastor. I grew up going to Christian school. I had to go to church every Sunday and Sunday school with all the youth groups and mission trips. I was really heavily involved in the Christian community and lifestyle. My parents really threw me into it when I was super young and continued to make me participate as I got older. When I was younger it was the only thing I really knew, all my friends were in the church, it was my whole life. I went to this school where they told us your skirts have to be a certain length so you don&#8217;t distract the boys in the class and all that kind of stuff. It was super conservative and old school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I really hated it and I became really disenchanted in middle school and high school, and I think I absolutely carry that with me as an adult, I really have a chip on my shoulder. I don&#8217;t know, ideally I wouldn&#8217;t have come out in my twenties, but I just internalized so much of the queer-phobia and homophobia around me that it was just for me not a possibility at all. I was in denial and really “othered” anyone queer I ever knew. I mentally categorized queerness as a perversion as a young child as a result of what I was being taught and that really stuck with me. Then when I lived in a small town called Roanoke. This is like southwest Virginia.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ideally I wouldn&#8217;t have come out in my twenties, but I just internalized so much of the queer-phobia and homophobia around me that it was just for me not a possibility at all.

I mentally categorized queerness as a perversion as a young child as a result of what I was being taught and that really stuck with me.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So Roanoke is like, I mean, there&#8217;s a lot of nice things about it, but there&#8217;s a lot of pretty shitty conservative culture there. Once I got to Richmond it was better, but it&#8217;s still like, I don&#8217;t know, people there are not forward thinking at all. Richmond is better but it&#8217;s still pretty bad there too. So I feel like I didn&#8217;t really get to make my escape &#8217;til I got outside that area, I think.</span></p>\n<p><b>So what was it like first getting here? What were your expectations of Silicon Valley? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I was pretty naive about Silicon Valley. I had never been. No one around me did anything in tech, and in college my program was very focused on print design. I spent a lot of time making print mocks and doing book crafts. I didn&#8217;t even have anyone in my life who knew anything about it. So I think that I came out not really having any idea, and being kind of optimistic, and like, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s a cool environment to work in. It&#8217;s fun, it has all these opportunities.&#8221; So I think that&#8217;s what I thought to be the case. And obviously there are a lot of opportunities, and there are fun environments sometimes, but yeah, I had no idea that it&#8217;s ripping San Francisco apart. The community and people, and it&#8217;s such an intense rift here. So I didn&#8217;t know that, and I was basically getting into tech around the same time I was coming out. So I was meeting all these queer people, and building that community, and they all really hate tech. So I feel like every time I meet a new queer person, I have to come out about working in tech. It&#8217;s super strange, it&#8217;s like existing in two different worlds, and I had no idea it would be like that. And they&#8217;re upset, and rightly so. A lot of my friends are getting displaced, it&#8217;s really weird. I just had no idea [laughter].</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was basically getting into tech around the same time I was coming out.

I consider myself to be a pretty hungry and ambitious person to make change, and do things that affect people. I think that has always been exciting. I also feel like it&#8217;s happening, and I can either avoid it or I can ride the wave, and do good for myself and try to make the space less toxic. I mean tech is happening and I really believe that technology can save lives and do incredible things, but unfortunately a lot of tech companies are focused on solving rich people problems. I just want to be around when the focus switches.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Tech is happening and I really believe that technology can save lives and do incredible things, but unfortunately a lot of tech companies are focused on solving rich people problems. I just want to be around when the focus switches.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Okay, let&#8217;s go into the dark side. What have been some of the biggest struggles for you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, I was hesitant about this interview, because I feel like I have some more bad things to say than I do good things, unfortunately.</span></p>\n<p><b>It&#8217;s okay.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, bad things. It just feels like, in office environments I&#8217;ve made a conscious effort to try to make the workplace safe. Safe for myself and safe for other people, and it just feels like an uphill battle. And I feel like I really want to be someone who&#8217;s being active about things and calling people out for problematic behavior. But that&#8217;s really exhausting, and so then when I don&#8217;t do that, I just feel like I&#8217;m internalizing all these bad feelings. It&#8217;s pretty soul-sucking. For me it’s really toxic for my mental and emotional health. It&#8217;s very bro-y. I walk around and see women getting interrupted and being shut down, and all sorts of people feeling shut down.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s these people coming from other cities and they went to some <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League\" target=\"_blank\">Ivy League</a> school and they immediately get a job. They don’t have any sort of idea of the privilege that they have and all of the sudden they have so much money. It feels like college. All these people live in these fancy apartments right where they work and they’re all best friends. All of a sudden they’re planted in the heart of a community that is experiencing violent gentrification and they just step around its citizens and order fancy food from an app to their apartment. And they don&#8217;t even have to really go outside ever. I was having a conversation with someone from San Francisco one time and they said that in San Francisco, life really happens on the streets, and if you’re never on the streets how can you possibly respect that? I feel like that’s really true. It&#8217;s just weird. It&#8217;s really like it feels like a sci-fi novel sometimes.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I feel like I really want to be someone who&#8217;s being active about things and calling people out for problematic behavior.

I walk around and see women getting interrupted and being shut down, and all sorts of people feeling shut down.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>You&#8217;ve kind of touched on this a little bit, but what&#8217;s it like being queer and working in tech and straddling those two worlds, one of privilege and one underrepresented?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s really weird. I feel in a way out of place in both environments. I actually met someone at work and we ended up dating. And we were dating very obviously for a while. And people were just like, &#8220;Besties.&#8221; And they just did not at all see it as a relationship. And beyond that with a lot of my friends, like I said, I&#8217;ve known people to get displaced. A lot of my good friends are social workers and artists, it’s just an entirely different experience. So, it&#8217;s super weird. I feel like I have to be really careful and intentional in how to talk about my work in my queer community. And I have to be really careful and intentional about how I talk about my queer community at work, because people don&#8217;t understand it. I end up doing a lot of educating to folks in tech. I have many times become the point of contact for trans and queer issues. Or rather, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisgender\" target=\"_blank\">cis</a>/<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexuality\" target=\"_blank\">het</a> people having issues with queer and trans folks. People will just throw their confusion at me, and it’s not typically malicious but they just expect me to explain all <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer\" target=\"_blank\">queer</a>/<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transsexual\" target=\"_blank\">trans</a> experiences. I’m not even trans… but people will be like “I know this trans person, why did they do this thing I don’t understand?” I don’t know every trans person and even if I did, no one owes you an explanation. I am definitely happy to educate people most of the time but folks so frequently aren’t even respectful of my time or the fact that I may be feeling tired or burnt out that day. </span></p>\n<p><b>Only share what you&#8217;re comfortable with. But, can you share more about your experience with anxiety and PTSD in the workplace?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, that&#8217;s something that is really hard for me to deal with. I think there&#8217;s a bigger problem with just the conversation around mental illness and mental health in America. I&#8217;ve had so many days where I&#8217;m just having a really bad anxiety day. I call in sick. I&#8217;m allowed to do that. But then I feel like I have to lie, you know? Because for some reason I feel like I&#8217;m not allowed to say, &#8220;I had really horrible nightmares all night. I&#8217;m exhausted. I need to think about myself, do some art, and then chill out.&#8221; I&#8217;m always like, &#8220;I have a cold. I have food poisoning,&#8221; or something. To have to lie about things like anxiety and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder\" target=\"_blank\">PTSD</a>, things that are already shameful or shame-inducing for me personally, and I think for a lot of people it&#8217;s just this big shame spiral. It feels really inauthentic to talk about it like that. That&#8217;s always really tough for me. And I know for a fact that a lot of tech offices and companies are taking really intense initiatives to promote physical health. They encourage people to take sick days for the flu, to genuinely rest and recover. I’ve never heard anyone encourage mental health days. I mean vacation is one thing, everyone needs a break but there is a special kind of rest and retreat needed for folks with mental illness and no one talks about that. I don&#8217;t know.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;To have to lie about things like anxiety and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder\" target=\"_blank\">PTSD</a>, things that are already shameful or shame-inducing for me personally, and I think for a lot of people it&#8217;s just this big shame spiral.

I&#8217;m super jumpy, and people will tap me on the shoulder to tell me something, and pretty much nine times out of ten, I jump. That&#8217;s just part of my anxiety and my trauma. And always people are like: &#8220;Oh, [chuckles] didn&#8217;t mean to scare you.&#8221; I mean, people think it&#8217;s kind of funny that I&#8217;m jumpy. I guess I understand that, but at the same time, I don&#8217;t know. That&#8217;s really grating, and that&#8217;s really hard, and it&#8217;s frustrating that people won&#8217;t see that and maybe understand to approach me in a different way. I know it&#8217;s ridiculous, but if someone jumps up, if someone startles me, I get really, really freaked out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People have intentionally startled me as a joke. For me, most days are struggling with a sort of ongoing fight or flight response. That’s what my brain feels like. Of course I’m jumpy. I’ve asked people to be respectful about it and some people are really great and other people… just don’t listen. So then I have to sort of consider outing myself as someone who struggles with this stuff. Like, will someone be more respectful if they understand I’m struggling with PTSD? Maybe I don’t want to talk about it. Maybe I don’t trust this person with that information. It’s frustrating that I’m put into this situation instead of someone just respecting my request in the first place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Little things like that, I don&#8217;t know. Not knowing how to address these stigmas in the workplace has been something that&#8217;s caused me to really back out and internalize this. And it manifests in a pretty bad way. Actually, Riggins (my dog) is my emotional support animal. He&#8217;s been my little anxiety helper. So, he&#8217;s really great. I would like to bring him to the workplace. And I know a lot of offices are dog-friendly, but some aren’t. I think there could just be a lot more accommodations for people struggling with mental illness.</span></p>\n<p><b>Knowing that this interview will launch after you quit your full-time job job, what was the thought process behind leaving to go freelance?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specifically what happened was I came back from Christmas break and I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m great. I&#8217;m feeling so good.&#8221; I went back in the office and I was like, &#8220;Oh, this is bumming me out.&#8221; So I got in touch with <a href=\"http://ryanputn.am/\">Ryan Putnam</a> to see if he had any tips or anything. He was like, &#8220;Oh, you should come work with me.&#8221; Basically the timing worked out really well, but more specifically as a contractor and a freelancer, people are much more intentional with your time. For example, if you&#8217;re a full-time designer, you&#8217;re probably going to end up designing ads every day regardless of how experienced you are. And I&#8217;m like &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do ads. I want to be illustrating.&#8221; So that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m looking forward to, having my time being more valued, specifically. And also, I just want more flexibility. I&#8217;d rather be home more.</span></p>\n<p><b>I will say, as someone who is now freelance, it is amazing to have control of your time, and who you work with, and what you choose to get better at. As long as you&#8217;ve figured out how to first create a savings account. Once you have a little bit of savings, then it&#8217;s good. At first, it&#8217;s really scary. But then it&#8217;s like the most wonderful decision you&#8217;ve ever made.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m starting this. I don&#8217;t know what is going on, but I&#8217;m not worried about it at all, for the most part. I&#8217;m just sort of letting it set over me and I&#8217;ll figure it out. I will be okay. And it just sort of creates this nirvana that I&#8217;m ready for. I&#8217;d rather take the uncertainty and the control over my time and my life.</span></p>\n<p><b>Have you found mentors, or people you&#8217;ve looked up to for inspiration?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that I&#8217;m still finding that. Working right now with Ryan Putnam has been great because he has shared a lot of wisdom with me. It’s really nice working with him because I feel like he has been really successful as an emotionally aware and vulnerable person as opposed to shouting the loudest. It’s really nice to see that work out well for someone.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are your biggest motivators, like, what do you think drives you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t know that I really know how to do anything else. Illustration is all that I really want to do. Sometimes I think about what it would be like if I went in a different direction with my career and I don’t even know what that would look like. </span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, I mean, it&#8217;s definitely tough as a creative who wants to make art that feeds your soul but also has to survive financially. That&#8217;s hard to do in this city.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. It&#8217;s really tricky. I definitely do a lot of fine art on the side, but I still really enjoy the visual design that I&#8217;m doing. And it is really nice to be doing what you love for money. It&#8217;s like the ultimate hustle, I really enjoy it.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do your friends and family from home feel about how far you&#8217;ve come, and the work that you&#8217;ve done, and how you&#8217;ve turned out? How does your pastor father feel?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[chuckles] They&#8217;re actually really supportive. They have come a long, long way. They voted for George W. Bush, and now they&#8217;re voting for Bernie Sanders.</span></p>\n<p><b>Really?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. It was a big change. I mean, when we were growing up, at some point when we were kids, my little sister was diagnosed with epilepsy, and they really, really had to fight to get her health insurance. So, they started to see the light of socialism [chuckles]. And that was kind of the tipping point. And then over the years I&#8217;ve just seen them grow. I mean, they&#8217;re still the same people, but they think really, really differently now. So yeah, I came out to them, and they have been really great and supportive. I get along with them really well. We have a lot of tough talks about their religion, because they’re still Christian, and the things that I believe in. But they are supportive and we get along really well. My mom sends me job listings that are in New York. She wants me to be on the east coast again. They really want me to come back and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to go, ever hopefully [chuckles], but it&#8217;s really nice to have their support.</span></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s really great.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, it&#8217;s nice.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? How have you seen it change in your short time here? What is exciting? What is frustrating? What do you want to see change?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do I feel bad now? I personally feel really, really, very torn about it. As much as I am in the camp of tech is happening, whether or not you&#8217;re in it. There&#8217;s all these ridiculous apps that get funding and fall through. It&#8217;s super weird. I don&#8217;t know. I see some good efforts happening and I see also really shitty things. I have a few friends in tech who are women and they have had okay to awful experiences. So I don&#8217;t know. I feel not too optimistic at this point. I think that the whole culture needs to shift for any of this to actually be sustainable work. I think the only reason I&#8217;m going to be freelancing with tech companies, and the reason I&#8217;m continue to freelance with tech companies is because I kind of do it on my own terms, and I think you have to make it work for you, for it to work. But I really hope that it changes, I just want it to be a safe place for people like that. So, not optimistic.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you think tech could be more accommodating to folks who are suffering from PTSD or anxiety, or other mental health issues, just based on your own experience?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, it&#8217;s a great question. I think just being able to talk about it. I think that it seems so much of work, even at happy hours, people are talking about work. I think that bringing some shift of people being willing to talk about what&#8217;s really going on with them. I just think that mental wellness puts me at my best in the workplace. People are working long hours and it&#8217;s demanding work, and I think companies need to create structures and places for people to be able to talk about that.  I think if companies are willing to talk about, it would sort of open the floodgates for people to be able to talk about their own experiences and make it easier. I think just facilitating where to talk about it.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in five or ten years?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would like to be able to get over my fomo enough to move somewhere that&#8217;s a little less intense than the Bay area. I don&#8217;t know. I think like, ideally, I see myself freelancing or working with like a small dedicated group of really rad designers or creative people. I don&#8217;t really see myself in any tech companies. </span></p>\n<p><b>What about 2016, are you working on any projects either for work obviously building your freelance business, but like personal goals or anything like that?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m taking a break from doing artwork outside of work. So I think my focus right now is to do my work and then focus on some more of my crafty hobbies. So nothing big coming up, no projects. I think this year I want to learn how to garden and I&#8217;m going to learn how to do woodworking. Those are my very chill goals.</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m all about it. Learn how to not work for a minute [chuckles], it is its own discipline. Let&#8217;s see, my last question for you would be, what advice would you give to folks from similar backgrounds or who have gone through similar struggles, and are getting started in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know we talked about mentors. I think what&#8217;s more important than mentorship or anything like that, and what&#8217;s always been more helpful to me, is finding peers and building your community. Just finding other women at work, or finding them outside of work, and really building that community to go back to and have a safe space. I think it is super important. I think at the end of the day, if you&#8217;re struggling with something, or having a bad day, or wanting more overtime, I think the most important thing to always remember is you are number one, the company isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s so important to focus on yourself and not lose yourself in the noise that is all of this stuff. I think that those two things have really been what&#8217;s kept me going.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think at the end of the day, if you&#8217;re struggling with something, or having a bad day, or wanting more overtime, I think the most important thing to always remember is you are number one, the company isn&#8217;t.

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Let&#8217;s jump in. Tell me about your early years, and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure. My early years. I immigrated here when I was three. I don&#8217;t have any real memories of living in the Philippines, but that&#8217;s where I was born. I was largely raised in San Francisco, in a neighborhood called Bernal Heights. Back then, it was mostly just a blue-collar, lower-middle-class neighborhood. It wasn’t what it is today, which is starting to look a little chichi in some respects. Back then, security alarm systems for people were dogs in front of their houses that were loose and chasing you away. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had to actually start going to school on my own at a pretty young age. I was walking by myself to school at the age of seven which can be a little scary in the city. Coming from an immigrant family, my parents were both working and they had asked my sisters for help with dropping me off at school, but they had their own world of stuff that they were dealing with. So, I ended up walking to school on my own. I was also a latchkey kid as early as five years old. It can be scary being at home alone, and so I had to learn to be independent and resourceful really early on. You have to be street smart and careful, so you in some ways you have to grow up too early.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was walking by myself to school at the age of seven which can be a little scary in the city.

So, I ended up walking to school on my own.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You kind of lose that sense of innocence about things that kids should really enjoy. Like Santa and the tooth fairy. My parents, up front, when I was around five or six, told me there&#8217;s no such thing as Santa Claus and there&#8217;s no tooth fairy. I&#8217;ve been happy as a mother to see that innocence through the eyes of my children. I think that it&#8217;s wonderful to keep that in our young children for as long as possible, because the pragmatics of life will set in soon enough, and there&#8217;s no need to do that too early.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started playing tennis when I was seven. My dad would play tennis on the weekend, from around six in the morning until noon, and so I&#8217;d hang out on the courts with him while he played with his friends. I would mostly go hit against a wall to practice playing tennis, and then he would spare half an hour or so to play with me at the end. As I got older, there was this national program during summer breaks that was cofounded by the legendary American tennis pro </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Ashe\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arthur Ashe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> called </span><a href=\"http://www.ustafoundation.com/njtl/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Junior Tennis League</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (NJTL). They were for inner-city kids to keep them out of trouble, because they knew that a lot of people couldn&#8217;t afford summer camps. I was one of those kids. I started playing more formal tennis and I was getting more actual lessons through that, which was a wonderful, wonderful program. That&#8217;s where I started really competing against boys in tennis, and really becoming a power hitter and really just enjoying that sport. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I really believe that, especially as a girl, playing sports helps with development in math and science and the confidence you need that lots of girls lose as they get into their teen years. I didn&#8217;t experience that lack of confidence and I attribute it to my participation in tennis. There have been some studies published about how girls (especially those participating in team sports) do much better in math and science. It&#8217;s actually the opposite effect for boys. It makes them much more aggressive. I&#8217;m grateful for the  experience of sports as a regular part of my life growing up. I&#8217;m also grateful for the fact that when I was 16, they (NJTL) gave me the opportunity to be one of their teachers.  At the time I was the youngest teacher they had ever hired and I taught both in Oakland as well as San Francisco. That helped me start exercising some leadership skills early in my life. I really appreciated that opportunity and that responsibility, and also being able to give back to kids in the neighborhood.</span></p>\n<p>I started my interest in computers fairly early. This is way back when everything was command prompt driven. There was no user interface. There was no Windows. It was DOS-only green screen. Those were the early days of primitive spreadsheets and word processors. But it was interesting to use a computer back then – not everyone had one so it was novel. I grew up in those early days of using a computer when there was no Internet for the public. That didn’t happen for a while. In retrospect, it was a little less interesting too because it was more isolating since there was no social network to leverage. There weren&#8217;t any online resources to learn more about tech. The ability to learn from online communities and research was tough unless you were going to college and could get in those kinds of classes, which were also limited in those days.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I started my interest in computers fairly early.

We were an immigrant family and my parents had difficulty adjusting to the American culture. I was also the youngest of four girls but my sister who is closest in age—she&#8217;s about 2 years older than me—was born mentally retarded and her mental capacity is at the level of a three or four year old. Even though I&#8217;m technically the youngest, I&#8217;d end up spending a lot of time taking care of her. I would sit and do flashcards with her to try to teach her the alphabet and numbers. When I was a teenager I remember taking her to some of her doctor appointments and navigating the bus system with her to get there. It gave me a lot of responsibility really, really early on in life. I had my hopes of where I wanted to go and wishes for success. I did very well through most of my academic career, so I had these lofty goals to go to an Ivy League college at some point. I had made it to a top high school in San Francisco (Lowell High and they were rated really, really highly back then). I wished to go somewhere like Harvard for college but because my family life was really difficult, I had to make the decision to just compress my high school education as much as possible and I actually finished in three-and-a-half years. And when I was done and had finished all the credits to get my diploma, I left home when I was 17.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;My family situation was really difficult.

I picked up my love for computers again when I was fortunate enough to land at a startup company in San Francisco that was building a network layer called TCP/IP for Windows. This was back when not all computers had networking capability. I landed an admin job (administrative assistant), which was not my dream job at that time, but was something I could easily get, and was good pay for a college student at that time. It re-exposed me to my love for tech, and my love for engineering, and it was good to see the work that they did. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was also very lucky that there was an IT worker there (named Kate) who allowed me to spend some time with her, helping with her hardware, like swapping out motherboards, adding memory. I loved troubleshooting as well, so the QA team borrowed some of my time, and that was really great. That sort of really invigorated me to say, &#8220;Okay. I really need to get my act together and make sure I&#8217;m taking the right computer classes in college.&#8221; And so I continued down that route. I was in school part time and a lot of courses were very difficult to take at night. Generally, there were very limited classes in terms of the computer science program. Those programs were very, very new back then, so you were lucky if your school had a computer science program. I cobbled together my education as I went. We had a lay off at some point and I ended up in one more admin job. It was there that I was fortunate enough to make a connection with someone who recognized my troubleshooting and technical ability and after the startup was acquired, he recommended I apply for a support role at Lotus which was a subsidiary of IBM at that point. I interviewed and they hired me as a support person. I loved that they had given me that opportunity. It was such a great experience.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I did very well through most of my academic career, so I had these lofty goals to go to an Ivy League college at some point.

And when I was done and had finished all the credits to get my diploma, I left home when I was 17.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pretty early on I ended up coming across this scripting language that was part of the extension framework for what was called </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LotusScript\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LotusScript</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—it was in a desktop database called </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Lotus_Approach\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lotus Approach</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which competed with </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Access\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microsoft&#8217;s Access</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. No one knew how to use these API&#8217;s or the scripting language and I just sort of started playing around with it. I was able to use it to customize different interactions in the app. At some point there was an opportunity that came up for someone who needed to have some web skills and needed to know Lotus Script. The job was unfilled, so I kind of raised my hand and went, &#8220;Well, I can do this.&#8221; I applied. It was a little unusual for me to do it, because I was only three months in— three or four months into my support role, and for a good reason they want support people to stay in their roles for at least a year before moving on to something else. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They actually made an exception for me, which I was really grateful for, and allowed me to take on this role as an application engineer. That role ended up leading to other opportunities. It was still within the first few months of that role to take on a project to &#8220;webify&#8221; forms and reports in Approach. “Webifying” and creating dynamic pages was a thing back in the 90&#8217;s when most sites were still static. We were trying to take advantage of the new concepts of web forms to bring reports that people wanted to produce dynamically to the web. I worked with the DB2 group. </span><a href=\"http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/db2/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DB2</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was IBM&#8217;s database server solution. They had an internet connector that they had just built that could be used on the web and so I was able to connect the dots and build a wizard that took your Windows based forms and reports to the web and leveraged that dynamic connector. It was a lot of fun and a lot of hard work, and I did that in three months. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I demoed it to a really senior engineer at Approach his reaction was, &#8220;How did you do that?&#8221; because it involved LotusScript, which no one knew; JavaScript, (which no one in our group knew and was an emerging language back then that no one was really an expert in at the time); HTML, which was also fairly new and the DB2 connector which had it&#8217;s own scripting, language, and integration. So I just connected those things, and back then there was no specific layout controls in HTML, so I had to build these crazy heuristics for trying to adapt them to the web because there was no X-Y coordinates that you could actually set your elements to. But I approximated it well enough that most forms and reports actually worked out pretty well. That was one of my first projects and I did that mostly solo, so it gave me the confidence that if I could do something like I could do almost anything. And I kept going. Not long after I transferred into main product engineering—doing C and C++ programming—one of my first projects was dealing with the Y2K problem. A lot of people back then started leaving for startups, because startups were the thing to do, so IBM was losing a lot of people in Silicon Valley. Eventually, they decided that they wanted to start doing some consolidation of our group in Lotus. They&#8217;d acquired Lotus the year before I&#8217;d started there and then they started to consolidate the group that I was in, and so I ended up in a group layoff that they did in order to consolidate things into IBM.  I went from there to a number of different startups where I continued to do development. Recently I went to look up the status of a couple of patent applications I had pending while I was there at IBM and realized that both were granted! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was with the beginning of my career and I was grateful for the opportunity to continue working as an engineer for awhile. But from all my experiences with engineers, I was almost always the only woman in the group. There was one startup when there were two other women, but that was unusual. Most of the time in teams I was working on, I was the only woman in the group. To be really honest, it didn&#8217;t bother me. I didn&#8217;t really notice it in a bad way. We would go out for lunch, we would hang out, we would talk tech, etc. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did a gig at </span><a href=\"http://www.borland.com/en-GB/Home\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Borland</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for two-and-a-half years— almost three years —as a pre-sales engineer. I was one of three for their worldwide organization, and I started noticing, &#8220;Okay. There are three of us women in sales engineering. That&#8217;s kind of interesting.&#8221; Again, it didn&#8217;t really bother me that much. The three of us still kind of keep in touch. We obviously bonded pretty easily, because we were the only women in any of our sales meetings. Once I earned a top SE award for my district. I was really proud of that because that was also the year I finally finished my college degree after more than 10 years. My sales rep at the time didn’t even know I was studying at night so she was impressed that I was able to kick butt at work and also finish my degree.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Once I earned a top SE award for my district.

There also, for the first year and a half, I didn&#8217;t notice anything different. Again, I was one of the very few women in that evangelism organization. It&#8217;s probably a thousand people worldwide, at corporate it was about a hundred and fifty people, but only a few women. At the end of my first year, I married, became pregnant, was about to go on maternity leave. I had also moved back from Redmond down to Silicon Valley. They felt that I&#8217;d done well enough my very first year at Microsoft that they asked me to stay even though I was going to be remote. We actually had to get approval in order to keep me. It actually escalated all the way to the VP at the time, and he approved it, which was remarkable. Because Microsoft in those days wasn&#8217;t very pro remote-employee. I was very lucky that they allowed me to keep my job. Seven of the eight years that I was at Microsoft was remote. I used all the technologies that we had in order to make sure people knew that I was actively engaged, and still driving my initiatives, and I was still networking with the right groups, and getting a lot done in my particular area. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the first year after I moved, quite a few coworkers had not realized I moved because I was able to create a strong virtual presence. I started noticing that I was being treated a little differently was when I came back from maternity leave. It wasn&#8217;t immediate. I had what I felt was a really weird experience of coworkers, partners I was working with, and customers saying, &#8220;Wow, you&#8217;re pregnant. Congratulations, that&#8217;s really great. You&#8217;re going to quit your job, right? And stay at home?&#8221; I had that over and over again. And I thought, &#8220;What? Really, you think I should? I never thought about just being a stay-at-home mom.&#8221;</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I started noticing that I was being treated a little differently was when I came back from maternity leave.

Congratulations, that&#8217;s really great. You&#8217;re going to quit your job, right? And stay at home?'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve had this long career, and suddenly people are saying, &#8220;You should stay home” I was getting a lot of peer pressure. I got some from some local moms that I started to meet as I was pregnant, and they were all saying, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re going to quit, right?&#8221; And I thought, &#8220;Oh&#8230;&#8221; I just wasn&#8217;t expecting that. It was strange to me, and foreign. Not one person ever asked my husband if he was taking time off for our first baby. I was planning on spending some maternity leave off with my young child. I was excited about having my first baby. And I took the 12 paid weeks off that Microsoft offered at that time. I could have taken more through vacation time or other means but I took the 12 weeks. With that first child it seemed to me that 12 weeks would be enough – that was more time than I had ever taken since I had started working when I was 17. In the end though, 12 weeks, for me, wasn&#8217;t enough, and I wish that I had taken a little bit longer. As I got back into my role and continuing to do my work, that this term of being “mommy tracked”, I started to feel like, &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s actually real.&#8221; You’re not being given the opportunities to grow. You&#8217;re getting rated really highly for reviews and yet you see the remote colleagues getting the promotions that you&#8217;re also asking for. They happen to be male. And I don&#8217;t think any of that was intentionally malicious. I think people don&#8217;t understand what we know now as unconscious bias.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;As I got back into my role and continuing to do my work, that this term of being &#8216;mommy tracked,&#8217; I started to feel like, &#8216;Wow, that&#8217;s actually real.&#8217; You’re not being given the opportunities to grow.

That term didn&#8217;t exist back then. There was no way of knowing what was going on. I knew that my colleagues and my managers weren&#8217;t bad people, but I don&#8217;t think they recognized that. They were probably thinking, &#8220;She&#8217;s busy with her kids now. We can&#8217;t give her these responsibilities.&#8221; Every year I got great reviews and I was in the top quadrant of very promising and talented employees, yet my career really flatlined after I started having kids. To be clear though, I&#8217;m grateful for the time I had at Microsoft. I did get a variety of opportunities where I learned a lot, but I really wish that I could&#8217;ve taken my career a little bit farther while I was there. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The issues I experienced were not ones unique to Microsoft – these are issues that exist across our tech industry and we need to recognize it as a broad problem that we need to solve as a community. I did end up leaving Microsoft after eight years. I was ready at that point for bigger challenges. My younger child was in school. She had started kindergarten at that point. I really wanted the next big career opportunity. I went to Intuit for nine months. I was there for a short time in part because developer audience wasn’t a big focus for them at the time and I felt that was still  a big, big part of my career. I was recruited then by a fintech company called </span><a href=\"http://www.yodlee.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yodlee</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There I had the opportunity to exercise many different skills of mine from marketing to engineering, to planning and product management, as well as the evangelism piece. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And there was a really wonderful opportunity of just connecting the dots across many parts of the organization, and really focusing on evangelizing internally. The part of business that I was in wasn&#8217;t well understood, especially in our Bangalore office where all of our core engineering and product management was happening. So I spent some time in Bangalore. I actually did three trips in one year to Bangalore, just to really help educate them and to get the alignment that we really needed to be successful with that business. I&#8217;m really proud of that work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had a challenging project when I started. The developer portal they had wasn&#8217;t a true developer portal. You logged into a walled garden only to have three big PDFs to download as documentation that didn’t give enough guidance to get going on the APIs. It didn&#8217;t have online,, searchable documentation. It didn&#8217;t have a sandbox experience for you to try out the API, and I was able to get everyone rallied around it across all the different organizations, including the Security Office. So we were able to get a new portal out that actually did provide a sandbox environment, and that really shortened the duration of time for the sales reps to close deals with customers that were trying to evaluate their product. They were able to try it out and assess for themselves if the data they were getting was the kind of data that they needed for their solutions. I&#8217;m proud of the work that I did there. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was recruited by Atlassian where I have been now for the last couple of years. Aside from the fact that I&#8217;ve built an evangelism team from the ground up, I think the thing that I&#8217;m most proud of is that I took some of the learnings that I had from my days at Microsoft. I was a chair for the Women at Microsoft Silicon Valley organization there – we grew an active community and had regular speakers and meetings. We also launched our first Silicon Valley Women at Microsoft conference at Microsoft while I was in that team. But, there was also this concept of mentoring rings that we ran in Silicon Valley. I thought that was unique to us. I didn&#8217;t really find any other information about mentoring rings outside of Microsoft. The idea is that it&#8217;s really difficult to find female leaders to be your mentor, because there are so few of them in tech. Yet all of us have something unique to contribute in terms of the skillsets, backgrounds, and the learnings we have through our work experiences. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The concept was born out of the idea that we can learn from each other, so let&#8217;s bootstrap ourselves together with these mentoring rings. I was part of the pilot group. Martha Galley, who&#8217;s now an exec over at Salesforce, was one of the driving forces behind that. So was Kris Olsen, who is a friend of ours who passed away too early. I think about her often when I’m doing my diversity work. I took that mentoring rings concept to Atlassian, and did the first pilot group over a year ago. Just this week the participants from that group (six of them) basically stepped up to run three new mentoring rings that they&#8217;re launching over the next few weeks. I’m so happy and proud that they felt it was such a worthwhile endeavor that we participated in a mentoring ring together, that we all learned from each other, and that we have formed a support network and our work has lasted outside of that. I did a women in tech speaker series too, where I invited different people I knew within the industry to come and talk about diversity challenges, specifically for women in tech. All talks were published on YouTube. This year I&#8217;m going to be shaking that up. Internally our volunteer initiative is called Side by Side. That&#8217;s our broad diversity initiative to make sure that we&#8217;re being inclusive of all groups. We&#8217;re going to be recasting my speaker series as Side by Side so we can include a broader pool of diversity topics. That brings us to today.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There was also this concept of mentoring rings that we ran in Silicon Valley.

Yet all of us have something unique to contribute in terms of the skillsets, backgrounds, and the learnings we have through our work experiences.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>When was the moment for you when you realized when you were interested in women&#8217;s initiatives? Because obviously it became a huge passion.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. You know what? For me, it was a &#8220;start-stop, start-stop&#8221; thing. Because I really wasn&#8217;t sure what I was experiencing when I came back from maternity leave, from that first child. There was this group starting out in Silicon Valley at that time within Microsoft just getting together for lunch. I went to one of the lunches so I could feel a little more connected to the local campus, because I didn&#8217;t work with anyone on our local campus at all. I only worked with folks in Redmond and our field organizations. So I went and I remember thinking, &#8220;Oh my God, they have a bunch of pink balloons. I hate the color pink,&#8221; [chuckles]. I went to lunch and they just had a very casual lunch get together. The evangelist in me said, &#8220;Well, you know? We should have a speaker series. We should get more people rallied around this. Let&#8217;s make this more structured. Get more people to come by inviting a speaker. We can still do the networking thing but why don&#8217;t we start getting people to come speak about these different topics.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cgalvan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Claudia Galvan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who was one of the chairs at the time—she&#8217;s gone into a number of other amazing women in tech initiatives, and she&#8217;s still very, very active—reacted with, &#8220;Well, you should join our board.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Sure, why not?&#8221; I figured it would be a great opportunity to stay more connected. But to be honest, at that time, I just didn&#8217;t really identify that much with the issues. It took actually participating on that board for me to hear what was going on with the people on the board and people that would come to our program. I built my empathy around what was going on with other women. I realized, &#8220;Oh, well actually, this thing where I&#8217;m being told I need to work on my soft skills is because I&#8217;m assertive and they&#8217;re not used to women being assertive. They want me to be the quiet mommy in the corner. Got it, okay.&#8221; Other people are experiencing that.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I built my empathy around what was going on with other women.

Got it, okay.&#8217; Other people are experiencing that.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It helped me identify and put a label to some of the problems that were going on and realize that, &#8220;Oh, it is actually part of this diversity stuff that people are talking about.&#8221; It&#8217;s an issue, I just didn&#8217;t realize that was the experience I was having.  It’s all part of this. When I left Microsoft I was really just focusing on getting my career back on track at Intuit and Yodlee and there were already staffers running initiatives like that. I didn&#8217;t feel a compelling reason to be a driver in that area. I was happy to be a participant and supporter. It was at Atlassian where I felt like there wasn&#8217;t as much of that support yet and that I needed to help bring that along. I&#8217;ve been really happy to be part of the volunteer groups that are starting to embrace some of those changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The wonderful thing about Atlassian is our strong values. One of them is “Be the change you seek”. I took that and ran. The mentoring rings that I introduced were also launched in Sydney after our pilot in San Francisco. The leaders there reached out to me about how to run it, what people get out of it, what the ground rules are. They ran a successful one in Sydney. They also still meet up more casually like our group does. I think they&#8217;re also considering more mentoring rings. It was amazing that word got out about the mentoring rings experience such that so many people wanted to sign up in San Francisco, we had enough for three rings for this year! I thought it was really neat and I was just so proud of the team just to step up and pay it forward.</span></p>\n<p><b>Over the years, have you seen the issues women are facing change? Or have they been really constant over time?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s a great question. I think a lot of it has been constant over time. I don&#8217;t know if you saw—There were some reports the other day about how someone had launched a board list, a suggested list of women to put on the board. It&#8217;s great that it&#8217;s a recognized problem, but before we wouldn&#8217;t have even talked about that because there weren&#8217;t enough women at that level of seniority (a decade or two ago) that you could even develop enough of a list. I think, too, what&#8217;s sad and remarkable is that in the &#8217;80s we didn&#8217;t have such a significant problem with women in tech. We had a problem, but it wasn&#8217;t as bad. We&#8217;ve dropped the numbers, since the &#8217;80s. So the number of people that are coming in, that pipeline problem, really is significant. I think it used to be in the thirties and now it&#8217;s 18% coming out of school going into tech that are women. I think that&#8217;s sad. We definitely need to fix that problem, that perception of what life is like as an engineer or being a woman in tech.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;What&#8217;s sad and remarkable is that in the &#8217;80s we didn&#8217;t have such a significant problem with women in tech.

Absolutely. You&#8217;re a woman in the tech sector. You&#8217;re affected just as much as anyone else with some of these issues that happen. And you do have that unique factor, even though you&#8217;re in sales or marketing, you have to absorb some of the technology language in the products we&#8217;re working with. Yeah, absolutely, you are a woman in tech. I think the severity in issues may increase when you are an engineer because there are fewer women in engineering. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The language and behavior of engineering teams can be really, particularly tough, especially in a day and age where, we&#8217;re very casual and we&#8217;re coming in with hoodies, t-shirts, and jeans. We bring our gaming behavior, our nerf guns, and other things that are okay for the bro club, but not very inclusive of women that come in. And it&#8217;s not with any malicious intent. I&#8217;ve had really good friends in engineering. A lot of them, obviously, have been male and it&#8217;s a problem in education, helping them to build that empathy. It&#8217;s not that they don&#8217;t— they&#8217;re doing anything specifically malicious, in many cases, it&#8217;s just helping them to understand that things they do that they don&#8217;t recognize exclude someone. It can be harmful for someone&#8217;s career.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The language and behavior of engineering teams can be really, particularly tough, especially in a day and age where, we&#8217;re very casual and we&#8217;re coming in with hoodies, t-shirts, and jeans.

What is really exciting to you right now? What is frustrating to you right now? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think in the last year and a half it&#8217;s been remarkable to see as much coverage as I&#8217;ve seen around the diversity problem. I mean, the volume&#8217;s pumped up right now. There are tons of articles. There are new articles almost every day, which is great. So it&#8217;s more of that education. What I would love to see more of—and I know a lot of companies are looking at this internally—is how to make actionable positive changes. A lot of that&#8217;s turning into “How do we roll out our unconscious bias training and make sure that it sticks?” How do we make that effective and not just have a presentation where we make people aware and then leave them feeling helpless that, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s just  innate— it&#8217;s a by-product of the fact that we learn those behaviors from caveman days to survive.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p>You stereotype people based on something that has been built into your brain to help make sure that you can identify danger really quickly and run, but we apply that in our daily work life to people in not the best way. I think there&#8217;s still a level of pragmatics around how we make sure that we can really make those effective changes.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are women-specific VCs that are starting to crop up, where the real focus is funding female-led startups, which is great. I think until we see more companies that are actually being led by women, we&#8217;re not going to see significant and fast change, because by and large, most tech companies are still being driven by white men. We don&#8217;t want to start excluding white men in the conversation, but it&#8217;s about making sure that the company that you work for really includes as many diverse groups as possible. It benefits the company. There are all these reports about how the more diverse a company is, the better off the shareholders and the company can be in terms of providing the right tools and products to their customers and getting their share prices up. So there&#8217;s massive benefits in doing that, and yet we&#8217;re still so slow in making sure that happens, you know. There are still lots of baby steps.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think until we see more companies that are actually being led by women, we&#8217;re not going to see significant and fast change, because by and large, most tech companies are still being driven by white men.

I walk into my home and go, &#8220;Wow, this is really my home.&#8221; I have a nice, comfortable home in an area where I don’t feel afraid to walk around, and it&#8217;s a luxury to be able to do that. I may not have made it here, had I not really been determined in those early days to be successful and pursue my passion in tech and to believe in myself, despite the lack of support that I had back then. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I continue to use that in terms of solving problems and marathoning through cultural changes or organizational changes that happen. Those changes happen in any tech company you go to. At Microsoft we had re-orgs regularly—you could even experience more than one in a year. You’d get shifted to different teams and in order to survive an environment that can be really dynamic, you need to kind of be open to embracing the change, because that change can provide new opportunities for you. I try to stay optimistic. I&#8217;m also very pragmatic about things too, because when you’re a survivor you take things in with a more pragmatic perspective. When I look at these broad problems around diversity, I try to identify the meaningful thing that I can do to help. I don&#8217;t want to be the helpless victim. I&#8217;ve never wanted to be the helpless victim, so I do what I can to impact change. In the areas where I&#8217;ve been able to contribute I&#8217;m really happy with that, because I feel I&#8217;ve helped to make baby steps forward in my area, which for some people has been big for them. I&#8217;m happy with that.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;When I look at these broad problems around diversity, I try to identify the meaningful thing that I can do to help.

I feel like that&#8217;s more than a baby step for a lot of people. You know?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, back to what am I disappointed with. The numbers are so sad. I just posted a blog about getting young children engaged and really hooked on programming. My kids are between the ages of five and ten, and they have been playing </span><a href=\"https://minecraft.net/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minecraft</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I started doing research and I realized, “Oh you can do Java programming to create your own mods”. Those are extensions of the game, which I think are too advanced for this age group. So I started poking around and realized, &#8220;Oh, there is this custom server that you can run called </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/canarymod\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CanaryMod</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and then add a plugin called </span><a href=\"http://scriptcraftjs.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ScriptCraft</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that will enable you to do this in Javascript. That&#8217;s fantastic. That&#8217;s such an accessible language even at this age.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And so I set that up and started playing with the kids, and they showed me how to play, because I didn&#8217;t know how to play Minecraft. So they had to show me the basics of the game before I could be productive with them. Then I showed them, &#8220;Oh, you want to build a house? Sure. Let me show you how to do that.&#8221; Because they can manually make it. It will take them forever. But with programming, you can use Javascript and create a castle instantaneously. You can create another Javascript call and have a dance floor, or a bounce house, a castle, or you can spawn a cow [chuckles]. They just thought it was so cool.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wanted to make sure that they knew that they could do that, that they were empowered as young girls. I wanted them especially to know that math, science, and programming, are not “boy things”. They should see too that Mommy has done it, and can do it with them so they can do it as well. I recently blogged about this, and I had some of the parents internally say, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so excited about that blog post. My kid&#8217;s are also doing Minecraft. We’re going to try this out!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had some friends on Facebook who also in tech share that in their networks. That was great to see. I thought, “well, someone&#8217;s going to think this blogpost is lame.” I&#8217;ve tried to simplify this to make it accessible for—not just super tech-y parents—but any parent to sit down with their kid, and set this up and try it out. I hope people do more things like that. I know there are a lot of different programs—a lot of content out there—that focuses on teens, older kids, and college students. I think, especially for girls, you have to start a little bit younger to get them really excited about technology. It&#8217;s funny how stereotyping happens so, so early. When the girls starting coming home and saying, Oh, yeah, robotic stuff? That&#8217;s for boys. I thought, No, that&#8217;s not true. So I wanted to really provide a way for them to feel empowered—that technology is totally within their reach, even at this age.</span></p>\n<p><b>I love that. One more question. What advice would you give folks who&#8217;ve experienced struggles similar to yours, who are hoping to get into tech, or stay in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To people trying to get into tech, reach out in your network, see if you can find someone who&#8217;s in the tech arena already, who really understands the day-to-day of what it is to be in tech. People have all sorts of notions from Hollywood about what the tech life is, and that&#8217;s such a narrow, narrow view. There are just so many amazing opportunities in tech, that I wish kids would come and speak with us more, and ask us, what is it really like? I would love for companies to do more of the &#8220;bring your kids, bring your local classroom to work&#8221; day, so that more kids can be exposed to what that&#8217;s really like, and realize, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s totally accessible. There are women there. There are people that look like me here.&#8221; That&#8217;s really important.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;To people trying to get into tech, reach out in your network, see if you can find someone who&#8217;s in the tech arena already, who really understands the day-to-day of what it is to be in tech.

The drop-out rate for women who are mid-career in tech is something like 56%! 56% is huge. That&#8217;s too much. I saw an article a few days ago about a company starting to experiment with basically, interning their mothers back in via a program they are calling “returnship.” It’s a program to get women who have been gone from the field for a while comfortable with coming back. I love that concept because I think there&#8217;s some pushback with women coming back if they&#8217;ve taken a two, three year break. It makes it really hard for them to come back, where they have to start at a level that it doesn&#8217;t make sense for what they&#8217;ve done in the past. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other factor is just fear for the women coming back, &#8220;Can I do it, it&#8217;s been a couple years or three years, or maybe longer, am I capable?&#8221; That slow path back in and that support network, I think, is really huge. I think, too, that there should be an active network within a company, whenever a woman is leaving for maternity leave to support them and let them know, &#8220;Hey, take whatever leave that you need, and when you come back, we&#8217;re here for you, and here are other mothers that have gone through this, talk to them.&#8221;</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;For women in particular, many aren&#8217;t sure that they want to stay, and that worries me too.

I also remind them &#8220;Hey, you know what, don&#8217;t make any rash decisions while you&#8217;re pregnant, while you&#8217;re on leave because your hormones are still super, super high and you can make some decisions you might regret. Talk to me, reach out to the other moms that are here. I&#8217;m happy to help you, let&#8217;s talk through anything that you might feel is difficult. When you come back, you&#8217;re also going to not have as much sleep as you usually have. It&#8217;s going to be a transition so, however I can help you, you let me know.&#8221; I think that&#8217;s important to be supportive, especially once you&#8217;ve gone through it, to just let them know, &#8220;There&#8217;s a light at the end of the tunnel and you can make it through.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Let’s start from the beginning. Tell me where you come from and how you got here.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am originally from North Hollywood, Los Angeles. Most of my early childhood and K-12 education was in San Fernando Valley. After high school, I moved to Japan for a decade-long stint, but upon returning to the Republic of California I have been traveling to/from Japan almost every 2-3 months for the past 16 years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How did I end up in Japan? During my senior year of high school I was not sure what I wanted to do. Fortunately, I had many older friends in the animation industry, places like Disney; and the exposure piqued my interest to work in the animation industry. At the same time, there was a recession in the United States and a friend two years my senior, Ken Olling, told me I should move to Japan. He was already there. Given where LA was heading, I told myself, “Why not? Let’s do it.” and leaped from my cliff.</span></p>\n<p>Through a series of autodidact experiences, I went from animation and storyboards to graphic design. From information design, to product management, to lecturing at Berkeley&#8217;s Haas School of Business,experience design, to product design. I did executive management and leadership for Fortune 500 companies and startups, before founding my own two hardware startups. Recently I have been helping at <a href=\"http://dschool.stanford.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford’s d.school</a>, mentoring LGBTQ entrepreneurs, and advising a companies on the future of VR/AR peripherals, and bespoke rich retail operations with analytical insights, and home artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p><b>What elements of it are the most exciting and engaging to you? What really activates you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some designers just like creating. Some designers like to create for the sake of getting their work out into the world. Some designers want to create work that persists so they can say I did that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For me, I want to find the fundamental need and design to fill what is lacking. The most gratifying part is, finding a need, finding a way to create something that would delight, and wow, and make the end users smile when they experience that creation. What keeps me happy is knowing having the users love that creation as much as the team and I loved making it.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been one for conformity, or labels.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Let&#8217;s go to the darkside for a minute. What has been some of the biggest struggles and roadblocks in your work? Either specific to a job or in the rest of your life.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professional hard aspects were learning the grit and tenacity that&#8217;s required to try to raise venture capital as a queer entrepreneur. You know, I cannot say that I have had the darkest career experiences. Honestly, I think these and other previous hardships at Apple would be those experiences that consistently made me unhappy, but have galvanized and hardened me making me who I am today. I enjoy what I have done and absolutely love what I am doing. I am excited for what’s to come as my go forward.</span></p>\n<p><b>What’s your experience is being a techie in the queer community?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are levels of acceptance for nerdy and queer persons in the tech community. I&#8217;ve never been one for conformity, or labels, and I&#8217;m a staunch advocate for LGBTQ diversity and inclusion. Often times the Queer community in The City can be overly too serious and catty in acceptance of us outliers. Even CIS women can be quite catty, where I’ve recently run into this in women’s restrooms.</span></p>\n<p>LBGTQ within the techie communities has been warm and welcoming, and very supportive, with the exclusion of fundraising with some VC’s. Sometimes the investment banking world has an unfortunate bro-culture within senior and midlevel partners. Younger generation VCs seem to be the exclusion. Where are the Queer VCs and funds? (laughing) <a href=\"http://500.co/\" target=\"_blank\">500.co</a> and <a href=\"http://womenstartuplab.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Women’s Startup Lab</a> are the exceptions as they brand out advocating for these areas, I believe.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;LBGTQ within the techie communities has been warm and welcoming, and very supportive, with the exclusion of fundraising with some VC’s.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My extraordinary queer corporate experience was great and I’ve seen support grow and flourish since 1994. My early days of Macromedia was extremely welcoming and inclusive. Adobe with their legacy Aquanet (Aldus days) queer community originating in Seattle and Apple Lambda have been safe environments. Sony when initially joining, I actually felt threatened, but through love and management support from my team in Sweden (Sony Mobile) and Japan (Sony HQ), we were able to work to ensure a safe and inclusive environment along with a successful corporate HRC index ranking. Throughout my time as executive leadership at Sony, we helped LGBTQ expatriates find safety and security in the San Francisco Creative Center studio. I affectionately referred to this as our LGBTQ underground railroad from Tokyo.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, the progress my team and I made in North Carolina at Sony Mobile and Research Triangle Park just took major bounds backward this past week. I stand with my brothers, sisters and others who are being put in harm&#8217;s way if North Carolina&#8217;s governor signs hate into law.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trans people, especially trans women of color, are already at dramatically greater risk of violence and murder and policing restrooms sends a message to those who would do us harm that such behavior is condoned.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We, like everyone, deserve to live under laws that protect us from harm, not inflict it. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The biggest reason behind me not fully transitioning was fear for my 26-year career and financial implications for my family’s future.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>You&#8217;re the first trans person that I&#8217;ve interviewed for this project that hasn&#8217;t transitioned, and I&#8217;m curious if people feel the need to put you in a certain bucket or category trans-wise and have a hard time with it. Does that make sense?</b></p>\n<p><b>[Editor’s note: Since this interview, Ana has decided to move forward with her transition, and this question has been edited. CONGRATS ANA!!!!!]</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People have a hard time because of my size, age and need to categorize. I am 6’2’’, 300 pounds, and 43 years old. I am not a young, petite woman that is early in her career. I choose to manage my life circumstances accordingly. That said, transitioning means something different for each transperson from SRS to everything in between, changing their outward dress to align their heart, body, mind, and soul.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we first spoke, Helena, the biggest reason behind me not fully transitioning was fear for my 26-year career and financial implications for my family’s future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since our initial conversation around this project, I have gathered my internal strength, focussed on bravery, with the support of my family and global community of loved ones, professional network, and have fully transitioned to a woman. I told myself, “Why not? Let’s do it.” and once again, leaped from my cliff like times before when moving to Japan, or starting my first two hardware startups, leveraging my core beliefs in Swagger &amp; Whimsy, Humor &amp; Tenacity, Creativity &amp; Grit, has made this journey all the more rewarding. It&#8217;s a slow and steady experience and this project was the catalyst for my courage and my platform for the transition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dearest Ina Turpen Fried, you’re my muse, mentor &lt;3 thank you for helping through my transition &lt;3</span></p>\n<p><b>What do you foresee happening to tech and design in 2016?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For me, 2016 is about heritage. It is about building products that are authentic and built to last. Like Le Creuset cookware, or KaiKaDō tea caddies we should craft technology and products that will not end up at the top of the e-waste pile every 6 months. That will be a major macro-trend for 2016. From a tech and design perspective, I liked what A16Z said as their <a href=\"http://a16z.com/2015/01/22/16-things/\" target=\"_blank\">sixteen predictions for 2016</a>, two of which struck a chord with me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first one is Full Stack. Some people call it being T-shaped or being a ‘hybrid,’ being able to go deep in 1-2 areas and work interdisciplinary. It is one thing to be excellent in design, but to be successful in the future, you have to be able to know how to work across disciplines. For example, even if you are a designer and not an electrical engineer or mechanical engineer, you have become an expert in those fields to be in the trenches with them. You want to be able to communicate and understand them at a deep level to be successful. Andreessen Horowitz stated that they do not want to invest in companies or people that are not really full stack or have a full stack mentality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other trend that I see and am studying is the UI-less user experience. I am experimenting with UX agents that take natural gesture input, speech in particular.  Bots are the initial intelligence-singularity type of things that people will encounter. People on the creative side will need to get their heads around that whether we like it or not. It is going to be much like the movie Her. We will not be designing things that are screen or product based. Amazon Echo already does that to a degree. Siri&#8217;s not that great, but Google Voice is pretty darn good. Those are some of the big trends for me for 2016.</span></p>\n<p><b>What advice would you have for those hoping to get into tech, based on lessons you’ve learned?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s a global world. People need to live abroad for a while or have done some meaningful life traveling. Through immersion, you understand other people&#8217;s situations from an anthropological perspective. Then you can better design meaningful experiences or products. You can&#8217;t do it if you&#8217;ve only lived in America. You cannot do it well if you&#8217;ve only lived in the Bay Area because our microcosm here is weird. For example, you can go to the Palo Alto area and everyone has an Apple watch. You go anywhere else in the United States, you go over in Japan or Europe, and you do not see many people with Apple watches. So we need to get out of this microcosm that we live in and actually experience the world to develop that skill set and sort of that tool set that you&#8217;ll be able to design and build meaningful experiences for the world. It is about perspective even if you may be designing for your geographic region going forward.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;So we need to get out of this microcosm that we live in and actually experience the world to develop that skill set and sort of that tool set that you&#8217;ll be able to design and build meaningful experiences for the world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

My dad built a computer for me and my siblings in the late 70s when I was in grade school, and I still have it. It has a wooden case. You can&#8217;t plug it into a TV anymore, because that sort of TV doesn&#8217;t exist anymore, but it&#8217;s how I first learned how to program using BASIC. It had a cassette drive that connected to it to store and load data. I would write one program at a time or I&#8217;d copy a program out of a book.

I was a statistician and used neural nets to do predictive modeling. I worked in the database marketing group and did analysis to predict whom to target with marketing based on how they were using their cell phones (analog phones at that time—bricks and flip phones). I was analyzing data with a Sun SPARCstation running HNC neural network software and SPSS. The SPARCstation was one of the fastest desktop computers at that time and now they are essentially doorstops—they didn’t even have 1GB of RAM and they were considered fast and powerful. [laughter]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McCaw Cellular owned the Cellular One networks in the United States and they were the largest cellphone company in the early 90’s. While I worked there, they were bought by AT&amp;T and became a part of AT&amp;T Wireless Services. About the same time that AT&amp;T was buying McCaw, NCSA came out with Mosaic—the first graphical web browser. Mosaic turned into the first version of the Netscape web browser. I decided that creating things in HTML was more interesting than analyzing data and I looked for a job in San Francisco. I moved to San Francisco in 1996.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I worked for a small web company—now a huge web company called Organic Online—as their QA Manager. I left Organic to work for a startup called Electric Minds. That startup died about four months after I started there. It was 1997 and there was a lot of demand for freelance work. I started doing consulting work and then started my own consulting company.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;During the 17 years that I was the head of my own company, I would often go to meetings with prospective clients.

The company grew from just me to 30 people and then the NASDAQ crashed in the spring of 2000. By the end of 2000 the company had reduced to 5 people, as the dotcom bubble burst and hundreds of companies (including our clients) died.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I ran that consulting company for 17 years until I started at Dropbox about two years ago.

In college, I was recruited to become an actuary (because I scored high on their tests). At the time, the biggest reason I didn’t consider that job is because I was told I would have to wear a dress or skirt to work. My pants and jacket weren’t acceptable office wear. That was only 20-some years ago. While the tech industry is great for individuality of expression as far as not caring whether most men or women wear dresses or suits, it doesn’t mean that women achieve the same heights of leadership. It’s disappointing, to me, that it’s 20-some years later and that great individuality of expression hasn’t bridged the diversity divide, and we’re still in some ways talking about the same (or even bigger) issues with diversity in tech. </span></p>\n<p><b>How do you think the culmination of your background and life experience impacts your approach to research and building teams?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you do research for a product that has hundreds of millions of people using it, then you know that those people have two things in common: (1) they’re human and (2) they’re using some device to access your product. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re a team that’s doing research to represent the people who use your product (or, by same logic, if you’re a product manager or designer or engineer building/designing product for those people) then it helps to have a team that represents those hundreds of millions of people.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The more diverse your team is, the more you’ll empathize with a wider swath of the people who use your product, and the better your product will become for the people who use it.

When the team gets together to meet, then there are a lot of different life experiences and perspectives to improve the discussion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, everybody can look at a chair and say it’s blue, but if you ask if about the chair’s style, then everyone will use their subjective experiences and knowledge and data to say something different about the chair. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, you can do amazing work and create excellent products with a homogenous group. However, I’ve worked with hundreds of different teams throughout my career and have noticed that more ideas are created with a group that has more differences. It’s simply because how you experienced life lends differently to the work that you do. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, I grew up on a farm, you grew up in a city, I went to a public school, you went to a private school. Those experiences will give both of us different viewpoints and perspectives that will give me ideas and you ideas we wouldn’t have thought of on our own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s important to show up and be yourself in tech, particularly if you aren’t a part of the majority. We all have limited time here on the planet and we’re all better for the experience of working with and collaborating with and hanging out with people who are not like us. I learn better and work better when I’m around people who aren’t all just like me.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Of course, you can do amazing work and create excellent products with a homogenous group.

But I could, of course, go back to consulting, or find a company that has more people like me, and be familiar and comfortable and, quite frankly, be completely bored.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our experience at work is made better when we work with and talk with people who didn’t have similar life/work/education experiences. We find that we all have human experiences in common that aren’t necessarily defined by demographics or university affiliations.</span></p>\n<p><b>In your personal experience, what have been some of your biggest struggles in the industry, either as a woman or part of other minority groups?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was an article in the New York Times recently about why young women aren&#8217;t identifying with Hillary Clinton and there was one piece in that article that really struck me. It&#8217;s that young women in college haven&#8217;t been in a workplace yet so they don&#8217;t identify with somebody who talks about workplace struggles because that&#8217;s not something that&#8217;s happened to them yet. But women over 30 tend to identify more with Hillary Clinton because, when she talks about issues in the workplace, those women have already been in the workplace long enough that they&#8217;ve seen things happen, and they realize, &#8220;Oh, yeah. This is true.&#8221; That was me in my 20’s—I’d had a few experiences of gender discrimination but I wasn’t yet a parent and I hadn’t yet had decades of work experience and micro-aggressions and discrimination based on my gender.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve noticed, anecdotally, that it&#8217;s sometimes more difficult for women to get promoted because it&#8217;s the men who are doing the promoting and they tend to promote other men. I’ve noticed this across dozens of companies where I’ve consulted or worked—not any specific company. The people who are in charge of hiring or promotions often tend towards hiring and promoting the people who look like them.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed, anecdotally, that it&#8217;s sometimes more difficult for women to get promoted because it&#8217;s the men who are doing the promoting and they tend to promote other men.

That was the theme in the article about Hillary Clinton. In my experience, most women I’ve worked with have experienced or heard stories of seeing men get promoted and recognized when the women are doing exactly the same work. I would love to see someone do research and put hard and fast numbers on this but, since this happens inside of groups and teams, you can&#8217;t easily do research on that.</span></p>\n<p><b>You&#8217;ve stuck it out and there are positives to your career. And you&#8217;ve done a lot of amazing things. I&#8217;m curious, what&#8217;s the glue that holds you in place? What are the things about your work that really continues to activate you and what else is keeping you here? Is it support networks? Has it been mentors? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love the tech industry for the challenges and problems to solve. There’s always more to do than time in the day and it forces prioritization and organization. I like working on a team of people who are working on different projects. I started to get lonely towards the end of the 17 years of running a consulting company. It’s more social, with more opportunities to get to know different perspectives, in a larger company.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I saw a friend of mine recently who has also been running his own consulting company for a while, and he asked me, &#8220;Do you miss it?&#8221; And I immediately responded, &#8220;Absolutely not.&#8221; As much the continued diversity issues in tech frustrate me, I still love working in tech.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I like it for working on problems and solving things, or not solving things, or creating things and failing, or creating things and succeeding. It&#8217;s much more interesting to me than the consulting work I did where I’d work with a company for four months, work on one thing and then leave. I like being in a more dynamic atmosphere. Tech gives you that, and other industries give you that too—medicine gives you that, law can give you that, politics gives you that. There are a bunch of different types of work that give you that.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a stereotype of women, of moms and of grandmas, of not being tech-savvy (though most women over 70 are quite tech-savvy). Also there’s an assumption that I often hear, that if you&#8217;re over 40 or over 50 then you aren&#8217;t a tech native and you probably have a hard time with technology compared with a millennial. I’m not offended. When I hear this (at least once/week) then I point out that I’m one of billions of people in my age group who know how to do a lot more than just turn their phone on and off.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Back to ageism, I&#8217;m curious to know if you have started experiencing any.

Moms can&#8217;t usually figure out something like this.&#8221; I&#8217;ll let them talk some more about their ideas and then I&#8217;ll mention that I’m a mom. Or someone will say, “only young people do this, like you and me” And I’ll ask, “What’s young? I’m in my mid-40’s.” Being tech-savvy or using a lot of tech is not only the domain of people under 35 (any more).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s a stereotype of women, of moms and of grandmas, of not being tech-savvy (though most women over 70 are quite tech-savvy).

What excites you about the future? What frustrates you and would you like to see change?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wish someone would solve the video conferencing problem—video conferencing still does not work really well. I want a less bulky Android watch. The new ASUS zenwatch is smaller than the first one but still not slim and streamlined.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I anticipate some general anxiety about the tech industry because I think that we&#8217;ve already hit a bubble and we haven&#8217;t realized it yet.

A lot of tech companies have started up in the last few years that rely on contractors. I don&#8217;t know if it will happen this year or next year but it will happen sometime soon; either people will band together and unionize or they&#8217;ll start demanding higher wages or demand to be employees, or all of the above. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I believe and hope that automation and assistive robotics will become more integrated into our lives over the next 3-5 years.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I anticipate some general anxiety about the tech industry because I think that we&#8217;ve already hit a bubble and we haven&#8217;t realized it yet.

And I think that that isn&#8217;t valued enough, and it certainly wasn&#8217;t valued by me when I was straight out of college or in my mid-20s. I just thought, &#8220;Whatever, I know everything, I can do anything, nobody will ever discriminate against me.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now I know it’s imminently important to show up, to get to know lots of different types of people and to be present and to talk and be true to myself.

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My parents first came to California in the 1970s from Indonesia. They didn’t come from wealth, but my father was brilliant in mathematics and used that as his ticket to get out. He studied in California, had in internship in Alabama, where I was born, and then got his PhD at Iowa State. My earliest childhood memories are from my family’s ranch-style house in Ames, Iowa. Lots of snow. Lots of cornfields. Lots of pink puffy coats in the winter. Eventually, we made it east to New Jersey, to a classically suburban town called East Brunswick. It was strip malls, Applebees, exactly what you imagine when you think of a middle-to-upper-middle class New Jersey town.   </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;My parents first came to California in the 1970s from Indonesia. They didn’t come from wealth, but my father was brilliant in mathematics and used that as his ticket to get out.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>East Brunswick was super diverse, I had friends of every stripe, and yet I was also the only Indonesian girl I knew of my age. So from early on I felt like an outsider. I think feeling like an outsider—like I never quite fully fit in—trained me to be an observer. I was constantly wrestling with my sense of otherness, exploring why I felt like an “other” and not fully part of the American culture. It became really interested in dissecting people’s stories and understand how people related to each other in groups. That intense curiosity to understand culture and people’s stories drew me to journalism.</p>\n<p><b>How did you first get into technology?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s hard not be in awe of tech when you grow up at a time when personal computers were becoming ubiquitous and the consumer internet was unfolding. I remember when my father first brought home <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodigy_(online_service)\" target=\"_blank\">Prodigy</a>, one of the earliest online portals, and it was packaged in a giant yellow box. I remember thinking, “Wow the whole Internet—whatever that means—is inside this box.” That sense of wonder sticks with you. As soon as I could type, I remember sneaking downstairs to connect online. Later, my first job as a teen was traveling to computer shows to sell cell phone plans and parts.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;From early on I felt like an outsider.

That intense curiosity to understand culture and people’s stories drew me to journalism.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think it fostered the feeling that everything is accessible—just an e-mail, button or Google search away.  The world is smaller, things that seemed out of reach before seem less so today. I think that can have a profound impact on a child’s psychology and sense of limitations. I wouldn’t be surprised if that dynamic is as responsible for the current boom in tech as say the increase in computer processing power.</span></p>\n<p><b>What were your impressions of Silicon Valley when you first arrived?</b></p>\n<p>I initially moved to Palo Alto in the wake of the financial crisis, while Wall Street and the large economy were still reeling from the subprime financial mess, an interesting shift was taking place, the re-ascendance of technology powered by smartphones.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was early days, but you could feel that the seat of power was shifting away from the financial sector and moving west. This was a time when Uber was just a handful of employees, when a billion dollars was still a BIG deal with a capital “B,” but the town was electric, brimming with start-ups on the precipice of transforming entire industries and larger-than-life personalities, both good and bad. Who wouldn’t want a front seat?</span></p>\n<p><b>How did you make that transition from a successful journalist to entrepreneur, and how were you able to leave it all behind? </b></p>\n<p>I found myself restless a couple of years ago. At the time I didn’t know it would lead to entrepreneurship, it was just a tickle in the back of my mind. As a teenager I used to fantasize about my future career, I didn’t just want to become a journalist, I had a plan, I wanted to be on the front page of the New York Times by the age of 25 and permanently on staff by the age of 27, then you know, eventually die at the New York Times. By 2010, I was right on schedule. But something funny happens when you think you’ve accomplished your childhood dreams, sometimes you realize what wanted so badly at 17, is not what you want at 27.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several moments both big and small eventually led to clarity—one was a short conversation I once had with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman\" target=\"_blank\">Reid Hoffman</a>, the founder of Linkedin. He said something that really stuck with me. He was telling the story of Archimedes, a brilliant mathematician and inventor who once said “Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.” Reid brought up Archimedes in the context of his career and how he always wanted to create positive impact at truly massive scale. I had never thought of my own career through that lens but that statement deeply resonated.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;As a teenager I used to fantasize about my future career, I didn’t just want to become a journalist, I had a plan, I wanted to be on the front page of the New York Times by the age of 25 and permanently on staff by the age of 27, then you know, eventually die at the New York Times.

I wanted to drive all my weight against one boulder to move the needle. And as this industry has proven again and again, entrepreneurship is a great vehicle for that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it wasn’t all introspective meditation. I would also have to blame my partner Dan for tipping me towards entrepreneurship. Dan, who co-founded his own startup, <a href=\"https://www.zozi.com/new-york\" target=\"_blank\">Zozi</a>, many years ago, has been such a cheerleader and advocate through this whole journey. He helped me realize that I have the constitution to endure this grueling track. He also introduced me to my co-founder Angela several year ago. Even then, when I was still in the thick of journalism, he said, “You’ll love Angela, be nice to her, because at some point you two will start a company.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was hard to give up something I spent a decade-plus building, but once I realized what I wanted, the shape I wanted my career to take, the fear of giving up what I had built was trumped by the fear of losing precious minutes in my life in pursuit of what I really wanted. </span></p>\n<p><b>How has life changed the most since you decided to become an entrepreneur?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ha, in four words: more stress, less sleep. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fear of failure hangs over you. At the WSJ, or  NYT, that was never a concern. Sure, I could write a terrible story, but as long as I crossed my Ts and was reasonably responsible there was nothing I could do that was THAT bad. Not so much today, I feel like there are a million ways to fail, a million ways something can go wrong. A young company is just at a precarious state, you’re fighting to keep it alive. You just hope that at the end of the day, you make more good decisions than bad ones. Or at the very least, that the bad ones will not fundamentally change your company. </span></p>\n<p>It’s a constant state of worrying, and learning to handle so many different tasks at once—most of which you’re not qualified to do. In one hour, I could go from designing marketing materials on photoshop, to tweaking user experience on our mobile site, to hashing out regulatory issues. God, I wish there was a manual on how to build a startup, someone should really write the definitive book.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The fear of failure hangs over you.

We’re building the company in Los Angeles, though I still come up north for a few days once every 1-2 months. The separation has probably helped me be more heads-down in building the company and less tied to the minute-by-minute machinations of the industry.  I admit, I had an unhealthy relationship with Twitter, social media. I essentially took a break and realized that the things I once obsessed about as a tech journalist, I really didn’t need to. It’s amazing how much mental space that frees up.</span></p>\n<p><b>Has your perspective of the tech industry changed now that you’re on the other side?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing: I&#8217;m far more sympathetic to the entrepreneur life and entrepreneurs in general. I think when I was a journalist it was easy to be really snarky and cynical. Journalists should always be skeptical, they should be willing to pick apart, rip apart, companies and people. But, now being on the other side, now that I better understand the complexities of what an entrepreneur might be facing, or just how layered those complexities are, I have a newfound appreciation for what founders are dealing with.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think when I was a journalist it was easy to be really snarky and cynical.

It&#8217;s easy to make fun of someone for a design mistake, or a widget that&#8217;s just not working that well, but chances are, they’re just fighting to keep the boat afloat. There&#8217;s certainly some bad actors in the industry and corporate malfeasance, but, I think on balance, people are often trying to do the best they can. And trying to make something go from zero to one, that&#8217;s really fucking hard. </span></p>\n<p><b>How has your past covering tech as a journalist helped you as an entrepreneur?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a way, it was like an elite business school I never paid for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I certainly didn’t approach journalism with that perspective, but it was a welcome byproduct in the end. I’ve interviewed hundreds of founders,  investors, at nearly every stage, from zero to unicorn. It was an immense education, like a long string of Harvard Business School case studies. It gave me the opportunity to closely examine companies and dissect their wins and their failures. And as a journalist, I also got direct access to all the key players, I was able to quiz <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Zuckerberg</a> about how he transformed Facebook’s mobile business, or interview dozens of Zynga employees, to find out why the gaming company faltered. It was deeply fascinating and educational.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This may sound cheesy, but I think covering this industry makes you acutely aware of man’s potential, the capacity of an individual for greatness. One venture capitalist who’s backed several billion dollar companies once told me that there&#8217;s one unifying quality of his best entrepreneurs. It&#8217;s not a certain level of intelligence, or their socioeconomic status at the starting point, it is their relentless drive to force their reality upon the world.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;This may sound cheesy, but I think covering this industry makes you acutely aware of man’s potential, the capacity of an individual for greatness.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A hunger to bend reality to their vision. As a writer, you meet a constant parade of people who have done just that. Suddenly, changing reality doesn&#8217;t seem so farfetched, it becomes normalized. More people you know have, vs. haven’t. And you reach a point of “Why not me? Why couldn&#8217;t I change the way things are in a fundamental way?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steve Jobs once said to an interviewer that the most powerful thing one can learn is the idea that life as you know it was also created, shaped by people, mere mortals, and that you too can change it, shape it. He said once you learn that you&#8217;ll never be the same. There’s a lot of truth to that. </span></p>\n<p><b>You’re a woman, a first generation immigrant, and a person of color—has that helped or hindered your journey?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My co-founder and I have discussed this at length—we are both women, non-white, and children of immigrants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are about as far away as you can get from the Mark Zuckerberg ideal. And while I’ve certainly seen sexism—if you think Silicon Valley is bad, try covering Wall Street and finance—I think the attributes that make me an outlier have ultimately helped more than they have hurt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I mentioned, I was the only Indonesian girl in my suburb in New Jersey growing up, besides my sister, and when you grow up always feeling like an outsider, you don’t compare yourself to anyone else. You don’t have a mold to conform to, or a precedent to set expectations against. I always approached a challenge thinking, well why couldn’t I succeed? It’s not like I’d ever seen an Indonesian girl fail.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being the child of immigrants is such an undervalued gift. You watch your parents rise against seemingly insurmountable odds to make it in America but you also see the struggle required to do so. From very early on, I realized that humans are capable of great things but you have to work your ass off to achieve success. My co-founder witnessed the same, her mother was a refugee of the Vietnam War who had $50 in her pocket when she came to America later built one of the largest automotive suppliers in America. When you’re raised with those stories, laziness is just not an option.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Being the child of immigrants is such an undervalued gift.

Anything surprising?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before becoming an entrepreneur, I didn’t really think about how my gender impacted my career. I think I was lucky to have strong female mentors in journalism and to have worked in diverse newsrooms. Not once, did I feel passed over for a promotion or an assignment because of my gender. Yes, I saw and reported on sexism in tech, but I never had to wrestle with those issues in my workplace.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s different now. I am definitely more aware of my gender. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anytime I walk into a room or attend a conference, chances are the ratio will be heavily skewed to men. The decision makers skew male. Way male. And even when gender discrimination isn’t overt, I think women in tech are always left dissecting and wondering, “Well, did he say that, or did that just happen, because I’m a woman?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I fear that progress will not happen quickly, it’s hard to reconfigure a decades-old, patriarchal-based system. Tomorrow, you can mandate more seats for women on boards or at venture capital firms, but that doesn’t solve deep-seeded gender bias, the lack of respect for women executives and investors. However, I do have to say, I have been pleasantly surprised by the number of men who’ve stepped up to help, to be so supportive, who are real champions of women. I can point to dozens who’ve really helped me over the last year, but I know I’m lucky.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I fear that progress will not happen quickly, it’s hard to reconfigure a decades-old, patriarchal-based system.

I really believe that what we&#8217;re doing is potentially very profound, and I want to keep it alive long enough to see the change actualized. In five years I hope to be exactly what I&#8217;m doing now, but hopefully with more progress. And hopefully less stressed —but knowing myself—probably just as stressed.</span></p>\n<p><b>What advice would you have to other aspiring entrepreneurs or folks wanting to leave what they&#8217;re doing now to start something they&#8217;re passionate about?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t want say, &#8216;just do it,&#8217; and suggest you quit without really thinking it through. </span></p>\n<p>You have to really look at yourself and think about if you have the mentality to do this because it will beat you up. and most of this is not glamorous, so a heavy dose of self-reflection that&#8217;s stage one. Be ready for the roller coaster of being an entrepreneur and potentially losing everything.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was about to make the leap, I made myself go through a thought experiment. I asked myself, “if everything fails and it all ends in dust, what&#8217;s the worst outcome?” And I thought, well I’d probably find a job and even though the first job may not be as prestigious as past ones, I was fairly confident that I would at least find A job. And I realized I was 100% comfortable with that. That’s not terrible downside when you consider the amount you learn through entrepreneurship, and failing, and of course the potential upside of building something great. But prospective founders really have to be O.K. with the prospect of losing a lot. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, if you clear that hurdle, then I think there&#8217;s just the matter of figuring out what your path to success will be. Of course the best laid plans are always mucked up, so I’m not saying to draw out a blueprint in ink. Instead, have you thought through what your competitive advantage will be and what it will take to succeed? Do you have a sense of the big pieces you will need to get this to lift-off, and are you ready for the challenge of forcing this vision into reality.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You have to really look at yourself and think about if you have the mentality to do this because it will beat you up. and most of this is not glamorous, so a heavy dose of self-reflection that&#8217;s stage one.

Tell me about about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m from a town called Newtown, Pennsylvania, it&#8217;s about 45 minutes north of Philadelphia. I grew up there, but went to high school in Princeton New Jersey, which was kind of interesting  because it was a day school, so I would drive back and forth across the river every day from Pennsylvania to New Jersey to go to school. The school I went to for middle and high school was a school called Stuart Country Day School. It was very interesting, it was an all-girls private Catholic school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that was definitely formative, in terms of only being around other girls for most of my significant schooling. So I&#8217;m definitely a proponent of single-sex education, at least in the classroom. I think that it suffered a little bit because we didn&#8217;t have a social component, like a brother school with high school boys. The prom was kind of weird because it was just  women in dresses, but we still had a great time. But in terms of academics, it was definitely cool to be in advanced physics classes with all girls.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t really considered computer science as a major, mostly because I didn&#8217;t really know what computer science was. When someone told me they had a degree in computer science, I thought, &#8216;Oh, that&#8217;s like the Geek Squad.&#8217; I didn&#8217;t really understand what that meant, and what you do. As a funny anecdote, I actually remember one of my teachers in high school saying, &#8216;I really think you&#8217;d like this computer science stuff. You could get a great job.&#8217; I was looking through some information trying to figure out what kind of jobs I could get with that degree, and one of the things was a job at Google.  I remember asking her, &#8216;How could you work at Google? It&#8217;s a website; that doesn&#8217;t make sense!'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>I can&#8217;t even imagine what that&#8217;s like.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was pretty awesome. This whole concept of, &#8220;Women can&#8217;t do science” and “girls are bad at math,&#8221; just wasn&#8217;t a thing, because it was like, &#8220;Well, someone has to be good at calculus, and we&#8217;re all women, so&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><b>I love that. When did you first get interested in tech? Was it early on, or was it after you were already in it?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I actually got interested in that in college. I hadn&#8217;t really considered computer science as a major, mostly because I didn&#8217;t really know what computer science was. When someone told me they had a degree in computer science, I thought, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s like the Geek Squad.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t really understand what that meant, and what you do.

It&#8217;s a website; that doesn&#8217;t make sense!&#8221; [chuckles].</span></p>\n<p><b>Little did you know.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. Surprise! [laughter]</span></p>\n<p><b>How was your college experience working in computer science? I&#8217;m assuming that it was gender mixed at this point.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After high school, I enrolled in the engineering school at the University of Pennsylvania. First of all, it was  a culture shock to go from an environment that was all girls to an environment that was almost entirely male. That was just a strange transition to make. I think college is what made me know for sure that I wanted to be in tech. It&#8217;s also probably the time when I wanted to quit tech the most and it would oscillate back and forth everyday.</span></p>\n<p><b>Tell me more about that.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I struggled a lot with confidence and identity in college because there was this general feeling that there&#8217;s a certain type of student in CS and that student is going to grow up and change the world. They&#8217;re the next Mark Zuckerberg and the next Bill Gates. That archetype was almost always a white or Asian male student. But even more so than their race or their gender, it was really this attitude that you had to be bored in class. In your 100- and 200-level courses, you had to be like “It&#8217;s so easy; I&#8217;ve done this so many times; I&#8217;m so bored.”  And because they were so “bored” in these very difficult classes, they would go home and spend all their time learning about other technologies because they had the time to do that, apparently.  It turned into a vicious cycle where you would talk to some classmates and they would be like, &#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t know Django?&#8221; And you&#8217;re like, &#8220;No. I&#8217;m in CS 101. Why would I know—what is that?&#8221;  And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, well, I&#8217;ve been programming since I was 14.&#8221; So even though I was learning a lot, I always felt like I was behind my classmates because I had to work hard just to get my schoolwork done.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I struggled a lot with confidence and identity in college because there was this general feeling that there&#8217;s a certain type of student in CS and that student is going to grow up and change the world. They&#8217;re the next Mark Zuckerberg and the next Bill Gates.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>You&#8217;re not the first person to say that was the vibe. It was competitive—flaunting, some maybe not even being truthful about it.  Everybody competing about how easy this is, when in reality, most people are like, &#8220;Am I the only one who&#8217;s struggling here?&#8221;</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, and that was very different from high school for me. I&#8217;m not going to beat around the bush; my high school was very, very competitive. But you could see the toll that the hard work was taking on the students. No student would ever tell you, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so bored, this is so easy for me.&#8221; Students were like, &#8220;Yes, this is a lot of hard work and I’m tired as hell&#8221;. When I went to college, I really fell for the idea—for a long time—that if you don’t find everything easy then there is something is wrong with you. It felt as though even if you got an A, if you had to work for the A, then you didn&#8217;t really belong there.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;When I went to college, I really fell for the idea—for a long time—that if you don’t find everything easy then there is something is wrong with you.

That was a ton of fun. I learned a lot and it was incredible to actually see one of these big tech companies from the inside. After I finished up at Apple I went back to Penn to finish my Master&#8217;s. Looking back, I think the reason I did the Master&#8217;s was because I didn&#8217;t feel confident in my own skills. I figured instead of graduating with a Bachelor&#8217;s and maybe not getting the job I wanted, I would stay for another year and finish up the Master&#8217;s. I thought that would put me on par with my undergrad classmates, which was not true, but that&#8217;s what I still believed deep down.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I went back and did my Master’s, and while I was in school I met a guy named Andrew, who eventually became a good friend of mine. When I met him, he was looking for people to work on his app. He was a business and product-minded kind of guy with a lot of hustle, and I decided to work with him and see what came of it. We ended up working together during my last semester on iPhone/iPad apps, and we had a ton of fun. So after I graduated, we decided to just start a company called Nymbly. It was just the two of us, contracting and writing apps. We did that for about a year, and we had this whole plan where we were going to become this tech/media empire where we would do contracting, then subcontracting, and then start coming out with original content. We had a few successful apps, but the overall vision was way too ambitious. After a year I was struggling, and we decided to take a break and quit while we were ahead and still friends—and still healthy [laughter]. We ended up going to a company in New York called Fueled. It was this big flashy agency that was doing apps for both big companies and one-person startups, and they had their own original content. It was exactly like what we had hoped our company would be. We both quit Nymbly, applied to Fueled, and got hired in more or less the same roles. That was super cool, because it felt like an acquisition but without the paperwork [laughter]. I ended up moving up to New York to work for them.</span></p>\n<p><b>And how did you end up at Google?</b></p>\n<p>Before I accepted the offer at Fueled, I had been in contact with a Google recruiter, but I put my application on hold because I got the Fueled offer soon after that. A few months later, they got back in touch and I decided to just continue the interview process to see if I would have gotten the job. The answer was yes, and I was like, &#8220;Are you kidding me? If I had known it was going to be yes, I would have just waited [laughter].&#8221;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it worked out, and I ended up moving over to Google New York. That was probably the greatest day of my life. The first day at Google I got the hat with the pinwheel and everything.</span></p>\n<p><b>Working at a website? Woohoo!</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I should go back and email that high school teacher and just tell her,&#8221;I did it. I&#8217;m working at a website.&#8221; [laughter]</span></p>\n<p><b>So you&#8217;re doing really well at Google.</b></p>\n<p>Yes.. I joined the Google Wallet team for iOS because I really wanted to make sure I kept doing iOS development. I was on the Google Wallet team for about a year, and then there was a restructuring and we ended up moving the Wallet team from New York to San Francisco. I had a choice between staying at Google NYC in a new role, or moving and keeping my current role. I liked what I was doing, so I moved to  San Francisco, and that&#8217;s where I am now. I live in Oakland these days.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was terrified, but I didn’t want to tell anyone at work that, so I tried to be confident at work and then I would go home and freak out. I was really afraid that I was going to mess it up and that in messing it up not only would I ruin my own career, I would ruin the careers of all the people who came after me that look like me. I was afraid that if I made a major mistake people would say, &#8216;See, this is why we don’t put black women in charge of stuff because look what happened to Google Wallet,&#8217; and that would be the reference from then on.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>How was that shift for you? I&#8217;ve lived in New York and San Francisco and I love them both, but they&#8217;re so different.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was a crazy shift. As an East-Coaster I am confused by California daily, and I just don&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s wrong with people sometimes. They’re too nice!</span></p>\n<p><b>I get it.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. The geographical transition was interesting, but the work transition was even more daunting. In the shuffle of moving everything from New York to California I went from being one of a handful of junior engineers on the team to being the lead engineer. I decided to run with it and it&#8217;s been about a year since then.</span></p>\n<p><b>Was there any apprehension about suddenly taking charge ?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was terrified, but I didn’t want to tell anyone at work that, so I tried to be confident at work and then I would go home and freak out. I was really afraid that I was going to mess it up and that in messing it up not only would I ruin my own career, I would ruin the careers of all the people who came after me that look like me. I was afraid that if I made a major mistake people would say, “See, this is why we don’t put black women in charge of stuff because look what happened to Google Wallet,” and that would be the reference from then on.</span></p>\n<p><b>On that note, what has been your struggle either in work, or the culture, or anything?  What has been hard for you and what have been road blocks?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that at work my struggle has really been this fear of failure, specifically being afraid that my failure is going to be an issue for not only myself but also for other black women in the future. Sometimes that leads to a little bit of extra frustration. I look around at my coworkers and I know that if a white guy messes something up he’s probably going to be fine, relatively speaking. Sure, he messed up the big meeting, but no one&#8217;s going to look at him and think, &#8220;Boy, that went poorly, maybe we shouldn’t let white guys run meetings anymore.&#8221; That&#8217;s just not a thing that people are likely to say. Sometimes I get tired of the fact that there&#8217;s this extra pressure on top of already having what I consider to be a pretty difficult job, so that&#8217;s definitely a challenge. Some people talk about not fitting in with the stereotypical geek culture of Star Wars, Star Trek, video games, comics, etc. That hasn’t been too much of an issue because I naturally gravitated toward that stuff anyway. I think the number one issue I have is really just the confidence and the identity thing. It goes back to those same issues from college of feeling like I&#8217;m the only person that&#8217;s struggling with something, or I&#8217;m the only person that hasn&#8217;t read this book, or learned this specific part of computer science. That feeling is so dangerous because it makes you think that whatever it is that you didn’t do, you’re the only person that didn&#8217;t do it. “That thing that you’re not doing? Everyone else is doing it and that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re going to be the next Steve Jobs and you’re not.” And even though I know that&#8217;s not true, it&#8217;s very, very hard to break that cycle and stop listening to that narrative whenever you hear it. I think that it is really isolating when all of us feel pressure to just make it all look so easy and refuse to share that sometimes things are really difficult for us. I think it affects your work relationships, too. There are times when I&#8217;m reluctant to go to someone for help because I don&#8217;t want them to know that I&#8217;m struggling, or I don&#8217;t want them to know that I didn&#8217;t quite understand something. Sometimes, rather than asking someone and getting a five-minute explanation, I’ll go home and read documents for an hour to try and figure it out because I don’t want everyone to know that I had trouble. I know it sounds crazy, but I still find myself doing it sometimes, and I see lots of other people doing it, too.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think that at work my struggle has really been this fear of failure, specifically being afraid that my failure is going to be an issue for not only myself but also for other black women in the future.

During my time in tech, I remember just putting in hours and hours and hours of secret work, to make sure that I was twice as good without having to ask for help. </b></p>\n<p><b>In your pre-interview, you mentioned being a double minority in tech,  and I&#8217;m curious to know if you experience the two separately, in different ways? Does that make sense?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, it&#8217;s very hard. A lot of times, when there is an incident, it’s so subtle that you can&#8217;t tell what the other person was reacting to, race, gender, or both. I think the time that I&#8217;ve felt one minority status more so than the other is actually when I would go to the computer science club for women in school, or the female employee group at work. I actually feel a lot of otherness in those situations because even though on the surface, the group is dedicated to women and our unified experiences, they often cut out the experiences of women of color. It&#8217;s  like the lowest common denominator; the women&#8217;s groups only talk about experiences that all women face, not experiences that some women in the group may face. It ends up being mostly about the experiences of white women, rather than any and all women.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think that it is really isolating when all of us feel pressure to just make it all look so easy and refuse to share that sometimes things are really difficult for us.

I am learning so much from this project. It&#8217;s really amazing. Have you had mentors or people that you&#8217;ve looked up for inspiration along the way or have you just been creating your own path?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, I definitely have. My parents are definitely examples for me. Both of them grew up in low-income areas and went on to graduate-school and were very successful. Within the office, I was very fortunate to be placed in a group where the director was black. He was also one of the advisors of the Black Googler Network, so it was really cool to be able to talk to him, because he was someone who was higher up in engineering. He had experienced a ton of things within Google as an engineering director. But he also understood the product that I work on, so I didn&#8217;t have to talk in vague terms. I could actually talk to him about the work I was doing on a daily basis, and that was really great.</span></p>\n<p><b>Similar, but different, what are your biggest motivators? What drives you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s different every day. I think overall what drives me is really just wanting to see what I can do. I think something that&#8217;s unique to this generation is that when we were kids, we were told, &#8220;You&#8217;re so smart. You&#8217;re so talented. You&#8217;re going to do amazing things. You&#8217;re going to change the world.&#8221; So now that I’m older, it feels like it’s time to put my money where my mouth is. A lot of people are motivated by a single cause, and I just want to find something and run with it until I can&#8217;t do it anymore, then switch and do something else until I can&#8217;t do that anymore, and see where I land.</span></p>\n<p><b>Back to your parents, how do your friends and family from home feel about the work that you&#8217;ve done and how far you&#8217;ve come?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think they&#8217;re definitely proud. It&#8217;s funny because neither of my parents have technical backgrounds &#8211; they&#8217;re both in law &#8211; and sometimes I&#8217;ll try to explain why something was good or bad and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;That&#8217;s nice. Just keep up the computer stuff.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Alright thanks, I will.&#8221; [chuckle] But knowing people are rooting for me means the world to me.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think the time that I&#8217;ve felt one minority status more so than the other is actually when I would go to the computer science club for women in school, or the female employee group at work. I actually feel a lot of otherness in those situations because even though on the surface, the group is dedicated to women and our unified experiences, they often cut out the experiences of women of color. It&#8217;s  like the lowest common denominator; the women&#8217;s groups only talk about experiences that all women face, not experiences that some women in the group may face. It ends up being mostly about the experiences of white women, rather than any and all women.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>You&#8217;re far from home, so where do you find your support networks here?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s difficult, to be honest. I&#8217;ve actually started going to more meetups and events for women in tech, or people of color in tech, or women of color in tech, or any combination of that. Those have actually been really cool just to start building a friend network and things like that. It is tough, though. Most of my friends and family are on the East Coast. I also think it helps a ton that my boyfriend moved out here with me from New York, and we live together. It&#8217;s been really great to have him since he&#8217;s the one person who understands everything I’ve been through recently. He&#8217;s also in tech, so he understands the work I do, in addition to things like the cross-country move. He is  the one person that&#8217;s been here for the whole thing [chuckles].</span></p>\n<p><b>What do you think about the state of tech in 2016? What excites you? What frustrates you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think those are actually the same thing. I think what frustrates me—I&#8217;ll start with that—is this proliferation of useless tech. People are just pouring money into it, and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh wow, an app that&#8217;s like Tinder for cats.&#8221; I&#8217;m not going to use that. Yet, they manage to raise like $10 million—that makes no sense. It&#8217;s ridiculous. Especially in San Francisco, everywhere you go, there&#8217;s a person who&#8217;s trying to push a stupid startup on you. But I think that there&#8217;s more people who are finally coming to that realization, and there&#8217;s a second undercurrent of people who are intentionally shunning those things and turning toward what I think are better causes. I&#8217;ve seen education becoming a bigger thing. There are startups trying to fix what’s wrong with the government or the environment, and more focus on diversity and inclusion. It seem like people are turning toward more serious causes than just seeing what kind of app you can make, how fast, and how much money someone will give you for it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I&#8217;m hopeful about that.</span></p>\n<p><b>What do you love most about working in tech and the environment you&#8217;ve ended up in?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I&#8217;m a person that even if I wasn&#8217;t in tech, I would be a techie-type person. I would be all about my phone and all about my computer, so it&#8217;s cool that, given that that&#8217;s something that I think I naturally gravitate toward as a hobby, I get to see the cutting edge of that. And to understand how the products you use work is really empowering as a consumer. And then in terms of being at Google, I think it&#8217;s really cool that there&#8217;s so many people who are so incredibly brilliant and talented, that you could walk down the hallway and run into someone who wrote the book that you were just reading before you got up. It&#8217;s great to be in an environment where there&#8217;s that many smart people all working toward a common goal.</span></p>\n<p><b>What do you think your background and life experiences impacts the way that you do your work and bring something to a team?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that the number one thing that I bring to the team is making sure to always acknowledge other perspectives. For example, the product I work on is a personal finance app. Growing up I came from a very economically privileged background. I was a prep school kid.  Even though I&#8217;m privileged enough that I don&#8217;t experience some of the things that a lot of our users experience, I think being “on the outside” in other ways has ingrained it in me to always at least ask what someone else would think about the product we’ve made, and not to assume my experience is the default. I think that sometimes people get worried about being privileged and they ask, &#8220;How could I have every perspective? I haven’t experienced what it’s like to be everyone, that’s ridiculous!&#8221; The result is that they view designing products for everyone as an impossible task, and don’t even try. You don&#8217;t need to have every perspective yourself. You just need to be able to know that someone else might think about things a different way, or they might use the product in a different way. To be willing to go out and ask those questions and figure out what that different way of thinking is, I think it&#8217;s pretty valuable.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are you working on right now, either for work or for yourself?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For work, still Wallet, though I’m excited to say I’ll be transferring to the Android Wear team soon. Personally, however,the thing I&#8217;m really excited about—which has nothing to do with tech—is adult literacy, teaching with the Second Start program through the Oakland public library. I just signed up and completed the training, and soon I’ll be assigned a student. I&#8217;m going to start meeting with them in the next couple of weeks. I’m so excited to be able to teach someone to read.</span></p>\n<p><b>Do you feel that compulsion the longer that you&#8217;re here, to start giving back to the city and getting more involved in things like that?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, I&#8217;m definitely feeling very connected to the community in Oakland. And I think there was also a realization that everything that I have is because of the fact that I read something. I read some book that sparked an interest in something that led to an interest in something else, which made me pick up another book and read something else. And the whole chain of everything I know and care about is built from things that I’ve read. I don&#8217;t even know how much of my waking time I spend reading. It&#8217;s probably about 75 percent. I&#8217;m always looking at something. Imagining what that&#8217;s like to not be able to read and to be so cut off from that experience. It breaks my heart, so I want to try and do something about it.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Even though I&#8217;m privileged enough that I don&#8217;t experience some of the things that a lot of our users experience, I think being &#8216;on the outside&#8217; in other ways has ingrained it in me to always at least ask what someone else would think about the product we’ve made, and not to assume my experience is the default.

Where do you see yourself in five or ten years? Do you think you&#8217;ll still be in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, I think I&#8217;ll still be in tech. Like I said earlier, I want to go as far as I can with something until I can&#8217;t anymore, and then just figure out where I can go from there. I think that I still have a lot to learn in tech. I&#8217;ve mostly been doing mobile development. I haven&#8217;t tried my hand at hardware or server-side development, or even front-end web development. I still have a lot that I could learn within tech.</span></p>\n<p><b>Lastly, what kind of lessons have you learned or what advice would you give to folks starting out in tech, or hoping to get into tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number one piece of advice would be: tech is not easy and don&#8217;t get discouraged, or think you’re not cut out for it if something is difficult. If it seems like everyone else around you is having an easy time of it, trust me, they&#8217;re not. It sound  cliche, to say “believe in yourself.” But really, do it.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Tech is not easy and don&#8217;t get discouraged, or think you’re not cut out for it if something is difficult.

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Tell me about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born at home in San Leandro, in the East Bay, just south of Oakland, so I’m a Bay Area native. I have three sisters who were also born at home, one older and two younger. I soon moved to Hayward where my parents still live now, and grew up going to the New Haven Unified School District because my mom taught there. And she taught everything from performing arts to working with kids at risk and is now doing dropout prevention. My dad is a doctor and his practice is in Fremont, so we’d commute from Hayward not too far to Union City.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would say looking back now one of my formative things about my upbringing is that I’m mixed. I’m part Native American. San Carlos Apache from Arizona, Eastern Band Cherokee from the Carolinas, Hawaiian a couple generations but originally from Cebu, which are islands off the Philippines and Japanese from Osaka. And English, hence my last name. Apparently some bastard blood from King Henry V or something crazy like that. My aunt, I think, did a bunch of family trees but at some point, everyone connects back.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think given that ethnically diverse background, my parents’ approach to raising us was grounded more in a common indigenousity, a common indigenous approach to simply having a connection to this earth and to this land. So we grew up farming our whole hillside. Everything from beans and corn that are way taller than me. Tomatoes and kale and all sorts of greens and squash. All different types of flowers and succulents. It’s still thriving to this day. Growing up, it was really annoying to go into the backyard and do all of our compost and create our own soil, but I got a chance to help build that little organic garden.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was frustrating being out there in the backyard watering, when other kids are playing and I was always out there working. Though I think it did ground me and I still have a deep connection and sense of place on this earth. It also reinforced a farmer’s work ethic from my dad and his father who farmed on the eastern shore of Maryland. So there was definitely some influence from my dad and influence from my mom. She’s a performing artist so I have the analytical side from my dad and the creative side from my mom. While I was a baby, she took me around on tour and she would do different types of modern performances. Integrating dance, poetry, theater, and native influenced stories. My mom was just so generous with everyone. I remember growing up being so annoyed that we’d have people over to our house all the time. Staying at our place or coming over for brunch. She’d really try to take care of people and give as much to the local communities as possible. To this day she’s dropping off car loads of food, clothes and gifts for people all the time. When I was a kid I think I was annoyed but now I realize it had a much bigger impact on me in terms of my perspective on giving, even when you don&#8217;t think you have anything to give. </span></p>\n<p>Where we lived was also interesting in the sense that we were in the foothills so our area really felt quite safe and unique. Every home was uniquely built. In one sense I felt secure in our middle-class lifestyle. But then on the other hand, near us or below us in the surrounding areas of where I went to school and other parts of Hayward and Oakland there was much more disparity.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I felt like I got to see a pretty big spectrum growing up and then going into school in Union City. The elementary school I went to was in Decoto which had some notorious gangs and unfortunately some violence. So I think I was also exposed to that just walking around from daycare to school or staying after school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I was super lucky as a kid. My parents put me in a Chinese preschool. I have a few vague memories of making Chinese symbols. So that was interesting. And then with kindergarten, there was a morning session and an afternoon session but my Mom was working at school so I just stuck around for both sessions. I think as early as first grade I started staying after school in math club with Mr. Fogel who was able to make a lot of things, even algebra, super accessible and fun. Using tactile blocks and objects. I think those things probably were also formative early on. It’s silly to me to even think about that because for most kids who go to amazing schools now that’s probably the norm. But for a public school with a big population of immigrants and English as a second language and super diverse minority school, I think those kind of after-school programs were unique.</span></p>\n<p>Eventually I took a GATE test that put me onto a whole other track from elementary school all the way through high school. It’s pretty crazy to me to think that probably fundamentally altered my whole course. I was in 2nd grade but then I got moved to a 3rd grade class. And so, it just started accelerating from there to the honors track all the way through high school. The environment of those classes is very different than the other classes that were probably more chaotic. A lot crazier. With diversity of levels of knowledge and access. So, it’s crazy to me to think that things like that exist and hopefully they’re still getting funding. A lot of those kids went onto Berkeley. I was the only kid to go to Stanford out of a high school class of maybe 4000 plus students, which is unfortunate. I think more folks should have the ability to go there.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other thing that probably shaped my perspective on how I operate now is that my parents didn&#8217;t take care of everything for me and hover. I don’t know what these things are called, hoverboard parents or helicopter parents [laughter].</span></p>\n<p><b>Hoverboard parents!! It&#8217;s the 2016 version.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah exactly. Rather than my mom making me lunch in the morning, I would make lunch for me and my mom and I don’t know if they were intentionally doing that or not, but that principle of empowering me, or putting the responsibility on me to take action extended throughout my life. So, for example, as there were a lot of Latino kids and a big Hispanic community in this Decoto area, I remember going out for the first time at recess and somehow being invited to play this ball game. I still have a couple of memories of how exhilarating that was and just cutting and kicking and having a great time. So that naturally inspired me to want to play more soccer. I went to my parents and told them I’d really love to play in a league. I was probably around seven or eight years old. They just told me to go and make it happen. And I’m like, uh, okay. So I remember being so annoyed as a kid that I would always have to fill out the release forms and apply for these things on my own. Not to say that they weren’t supportive once I started doing it because then they would come to all of my games and obviously drive me around and buy me gear. But they really wanted me to take that initiative and once I took that initiative they were super supportive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recess soccer games were another small thing that fundamentally changed my trajectory because from that point on, I just started playing more and more soccer. First with a local club, called the Patriots. That was my first team. Very patriotic. And then I just excelled and got invited to play with a select team. That coach was from Germany. Coach Burnett. And because he came from Germany he had such a better understanding of the fundamentals of the game than any American coach. The types of drills and discipline that we would have was just so much better than a lot of the other teams and we did pretty well for not having much in the way of resources. Eventually I was noticed by a wealthier club, Lamorinda, which is a club in Lafayette over the hills of Oakland as you go into Walnut Creek. It’s a very affluent area. I got noticed by that coach and they recruited me to play with them as Coach Burnett was beginning to wind down his team. So that also then exposed me to a whole other world of wealth. Just a whole other extreme than some of the kids that I went to school with. So I felt like I really got to see a pretty big spectrum of socio-economic status.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that team we traveled to many places around the world. To Europe. To Barcelona in Spain multiple times. To Sweden multiple times. That wasn’t always easy. I remember having to fundraise from my parents’ friends and family. It wasn’t easy compared to the other teammates whose parents would just pay for them to go on these trips. But nevertheless, I think it really opened my eyes to different cultures, whether in South America or in Europe. I think that also fundamentally shifted my perspective. I remember being in Sweden, just amazed about how clean and how easy the public transportation system was and how friendly everybody was. I was just like, “Wow!” How beautiful the people were. It was amazing. I had such a good time there and continue to go back when I can.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next big shift was playing in these tournaments like the Dallas Cup, that got me noticed by some coaches from Stanford. I started developing relationships with those folks. I got hurt in my senior year of high school. I hurt my lateral meniscus in a tournament. And so, that was right at the time when I was in conversations with recruiting, who encouraged me to apply. I had exceptional grades like most kids who first get into Stanford but what I could get from financial aid was actually bigger than what I could get from a scholarship to play soccer. I think soccer influenced me getting into Stanford, but I think that the academic merit also equally contributed to getting in, so that was a cool to start another trajectory.</span></p>\n<p><b>It&#8217;s so interesting to me, how much exposure you had to both the lowest socioeconomic status in school and the highest socioeconomic status through soccer. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. Like some of the mansions, and private this and private that, [chuckles] to other people immigrating from Central America, or elsewhere and really having to struggle. And you have to learn how to hang with both.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I went through different phases in school. Wanting to be more cool and rebellious and wear baggy clothes and get into rap music. I definitely went through that phase. I definitely had my fair share of getting into trouble, whether it was pranks or doing things that we weren’t of age to be doing. There was a point before actually going to high school where I did get into a little trouble and I remember my parents picking me up at school and just crying and bawling. This is all while I’m getting straight A’s but I had this kind of dual personality of being exceptional in the classroom but also wanting to be cool with the cool kids and the influence of gangs and other sorts of stuff in schools. Anyways, I remember my parents just bawling and being so upset with me. It was the first time I realized that my actions have an impact on other people. So I think that was the big sort of ah-ha moment before going into high school. I just felt so grateful that I had that experience before it was too late. I thought, “Hey, I’ve got to be more responsible. I can’t just go along with some of these bad crowds. I’ve got to make decisions for myself and recognize that I have to take responsibility for my actions.” That was a huge turning point that helped keep me straight through high school because I didn’t want to have that type of experience again. I felt really lucky that it wasn’t anything that affected my record.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There was a point before actually going to high school where I did get into a little trouble and I remember my parents picking me up at school and just crying and bawling.

Was there a specific point you became interested in design or technology?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s pretty crazy. I’d go to Stanford for occasional events like Native American Pow Wows. I’d been on the campus, but for whatever reason I thought that Stanford was just all doctors, lawyers, and business people. I was totally unaware of engineering or design as a track. I don’t even recall using the word design. I was definitely exposed to art and performing arts because of my sisters and my mom. But yeah, even today, to just realize that when you’re in the Valley and you think everyone knows about all this shit. Many kids around this area and in east bay probably don’t.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would say also one other thing that influenced me and my three sisters was that my mom came from a lineage of really strong, independent women. My grandmother on my mom’s side, was a nurse and she raised them by herself single-handedly. With my great-grandmother, it’s kind of the same thing. In Arizona, she had her own home and was really independent. Horses and cattle and riding around. I think that matriarchy and having three sisters also shaped my values and perspective on gender. It has continued to play into some of the work that we do to this day. Investing in diversity. I think just having more respect for women. My dad was just more reserved and calm and zen-like. My mom was much more of the fiery one that would really take the initiative on things. So I think that’s also had an influence, but yeah, back to the question on how I got interested in design.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’d go to Stanford for occasional events like Native American Pow Wows.

I don’t even recall using the word design.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So getting to Stanford was amazing. And with influence from my dad, I thought maybe I should go down the pre-med track. I started off with Human Biology, which is a really great major at Stanford that’s pretty interdisciplinary and I finished most of my pre-med requirements. From stuff in the lab to all the fundamentals. I also took a lot of courses at the medical school and that was when I started to realize that I wasn’t sure I wanted to be in these lab settings. It didn’t resonate as much with me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time too, that shit was kind of hard. I went from not studying ever to being with some of the best students in the world. So, I definitely remember being kind of shocked like, “Oh, wow!” I actually need to do some work here and at the same time playing division one soccer. That was challenging. I remember waking up super early for practice and after that I’d go to class. I would just be so tired. So sleepy and that was really challenging.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of my teammates, Bronson McDonald was volunteering at this local non-profit called Mural Music &amp; Arts Project in East Palo Alto. He was helping start their History Through Hip Hop program. He invited me to come out to some of the mural making that was going on at that time. That was the first time that I experienced research process like primary research, trying to figure out the local stories related to the theme like immigration which was a controversial theme at that time. Interviewing experts and local folks, and synthesizing all that. Getting everybody’s ideas out, and then visualizing it. That was the first time that I got exposed to the word design because that was a mural design process. So from the research to the design, to scale it on the wall, to unveiling it and having a big celebration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was when I first started having an awareness of the design process. It was just so powerful for me to spend time with local at risk youth which again is this conundrum in one of the wealthiest cities. All these resources and then to have a place so nearby where there’s so much disparity. It continued on this theme of having access to the folks at Stanford who are like princes and other crazy stuff, to folks that just don’t have the same level of privilege at all. Through the mural project I started to continue to volunteer and I started to realize, as they were applying for grants, there was this Community Technology Foundation of California (CTFC).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I looked around at my friends at Stanford. A lot of my friends didn’t go to East Palo Alto. They had no exposure to these stories. I’m like, is anybody actually going to come walk into the “ghetto” to look at some of these beautiful mural art pieces? And even if they do walk up to the wall, they’re not going to have a sense of all the stories and the meaning behind the wall. I thought what if we start putting these murals online? And started to think about a virtual mural tour. That’s when I started trying to apply the design process more to the web in software. I started hacking Google Maps which wasn’t open at the time and using different tools along with a couple of folks at the Mural Music and Arts Project like Zach Pogue and others. We pitched and got a grant to develop a project and document, digitally, many of the murals in the local Ravenswood City school district and up the peninsula to try to be able to expose these stories more digitally. That was the first web project that started to get me excited about the power of technology and power of software.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Concurrently I’d say one of my good friends from Stanford, Dan Greenberg, introduced me to Professor BJ Fogg at Stanford who’s done a lot around persuasive technology and how you can use technology for good. I ended up taking a Facebook class which is where I started to cross paths with </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/blumenfeld\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ben Blumenfeld</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, my co-founder at Designer Fund. That class was the first time that Facebook had opened up their platform for third party developers. Our objective was to build applications from scratch and launch them on the Facebook platform. We formed a small team. I basically worked on a status message app that has all the features that we kind of take for granted now, like embedding photos, linking, replies; that kind of stuff. Collectively with classmates who worked on a bunch of other projects, we got something like 10 million users in 10 weeks. Mainly making these spammy apps like hugs and kisses, but I think that had a huge impact on me because it was the first time I realized that we could have this mass interpersonal impact. I can’t think of another class in history that has reached that many people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the help of BJ, I started to do research in his lab on these mechanisms of how can you use social applications to get people to do good things. So, it really started to open my eyes to the power of software and that’s when I began to shift my courses into human computer interaction. I started to meet other people that were part of this small major at the time. It was inter-disciplinary between CS, linguistics, psychology and I started to take as many classes as I could in that track. That’s when I started to get more formal training in usability and user research. Around the same time at the end of that Facebook class, I presented my project and I got noticed by Chris O’Malley, who was at Venrock. Venrock is one of the oldest VC firms. They’ve invested in Apple. They’re from the lineage of Rockefeller money. He invited me to come on over, have lunch and meet the team. I didn’t have any awareness about venture capital, or really much about startups. Even though we did these kind of social apps. This is probably around 2008 or so. I worked in-house at Venrock with the senior designer and a couple of developers, and we would basically help build product for some of the companies that they were incubating. I spent most of my time with AskMeGo, which is a live questions and answer site. It was great. I got to help acquire a few hundred thousand users, similar to Aardvark which was acquired by Google. I worked on helping people get their questions answered and how to surface really good questions. That was a great first experience in tech. </span></p>\n<p><b>So you joined Facebook Fund during college as well?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I then went back to grad school because I wanted to play for one more year. I got hurt one year at Stanford, so I wanted to play a 5th year of soccer, and I also wanted to keep going deeper into design. I lived off-campus and was biking down Lytton Ave in Palo Alto, near the old Techcrunch office and I ran into Dave McClure on the street, who I knew from the Facebook class. He was like, “Hey, what are you up to? Want to help work on this thing, Facebook Fund?” I was like, “That sounds cool,” but I just brushed it off. On top of everything that I was doing, playing soccer, taking super intense classes, then getting more into HCI, and doing research in the lab, I also worked most of the time, and paid my way through school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the side jobs I had was at a high-end catering company that would do a lot of on-campus events. There was actually a VC related event that I was catering and I was learning about some of the start-ups and then I ran into Dave McClure again, and he was like, “Hey, man, you should probably come over and learn more and help out on Facebook Fund.” At that point I finally followed up, but I think it’s just crazy to me to think that you could have those kinds of serendipitous opportunities that are connections from class and you run into people on the street. The density of awesome people that you have access to is so easy to take for granted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then I joined Dave to help run design for “fbFund,” which was a joint venture between Facebook, Accel and Founders Fund. There were around 22 companies we invested in and I was responsible for running a small in-house design team to do short sprints with the portfolio companies around user acquisition, retention and revenue. It was amazing because I got to see all these companies in their infancy, when it was just a couple people around the table. Little companies like Zimride with Logan and John before they turned into the multi billion dollar company Lyft. Little companies like Run My Errand with Leah before she turned it into TaskRabbit. Alain and the Wildfire team before they grew it and sold it to Google for hundreds of millions. It’s crazy to see those companies form from the ground up.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;One of the side jobs I had was at a high-end catering company that would do a lot of on-campus events.

Facebook Connect, the little button that you see around to log-in everywhere was new at the time, so they wanted more companies to showcase that. This is also when I started to realize that I needed to scale myself. I couldn’t serve all 22 companies. It wasn’t possible. So I started to think how could I take a lot of the learnings from the design school. How could I take a lot of that design thinking and prove that it works in the context of early stage start-ups. That includes office hours, talks, workshops, etc. I brought over whiteboards that I borrowed from the d.school. Scott Doorley who is now the Creative Director was so gracious to literally let me come with a truck and pick up a bunch of their equipment and take it over to Facebook. I had to figure out how to scale design and with the success of Facebook Fund, Dave went on to start his own fund.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I was finishing up grad school, I was also starting to go deeper into design. I took a course, entrepreneurial design for extreme affordability. On one hand, I’m exposed to of all these social apps that are scaling and on the other end of the extreme, I’m working on low-cost water pumps, storage, and irrigation for rural farmers in Burma (Myanmar). It was a year long course where we did a lot of research, prototyping, testing, and went out to Burma during spring break. Being out in the field trying to empathize with people rather than just trying to push our solution onto them. Really trying to understand their needs. I remember sitting there in the field, observing this young girl, who was probably the same age as my sister at the time, a young teen, or maybe even younger, squat down and pick up gallons and gallons of water on her shoulder. She would go back and forth with tons of water over the course of a day. That’s one of the big things keeping her from going to school. I just had empathy for her. Especially given that I had a sister too, around her age. That again informed my perspective on what is meaningful impact. What’s the power of these technologies to really fundamentally affect people’s lives. I continued to do projects like that through grad school. For example in South Africa with FrontlineSMS:Medic. I worked on mobile texting apps to help virtual health workers report infectious diseases. Another amazing experience. That was another thing that opened my eyes to the power of technology to help. Walking into some of those hospitals and seeing people on stretchers. I think it grounded me in terms of technology that actually matters, that makes a difference, versus technology that just plays at our egos and our vices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After finishing up grad school, I remember working harder during that time period, than ever. Of course, not sleeping, and all of the classic things. Anyway, 500 Startups didn’t have a brand, or even a name. We didn’t have a logo mark, or a typeface, or a website, or any money in the bank, or any space, or anything. The job, really, was just to do everything that I could, to help get 500 Startups off the ground. Launching our site, designing and helping close on 10,000 square feet in Mountain View, and doing that buildout. I really credit Dave, to just empower me. During my time there, I focused on our accelerator program and the problem of how to scale design services. How to scale great design, to dozens of companies at a time.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I worked on mobile texting apps to help virtual health workers report infectious diseases.

Design Sprints, talks, workshops, pattern libraries, UI kits, all sorts of things. It was great. I got to work with companies like Punchd, that was acquired by Google, and invested in Bēhance, which was acquired by Adobe. I worked with Tiny Post, acquired by Trip Advisor. I got a chance to not only help hands-on with companies, but also start to invest. One day while meditating at my place in Palo Alto, I just had this a-ha moment, which was like, shit, am I having long term impact with these companies? If I follow up, three, six months or a year down the road, how many of these companies will still be practicing these human-centered methods? What I noticed was that it was exponential decay. You would improve someone’s design sense, or their awareness of customers, but then if no one on the team was there to help sustain it, and to continue modeling and practicing these design behaviors, it’s not sustainable. People would just revert back to whatever they’re comfortable with. If you have an engineering background, you’re probably just going to focus more on solving problems from an engineering perspective, or a business perspective. It really bummed me out, that as I started to look back, I’m like, man, I’ve been working on all these companies over the past few years, but am I having long term impact with them?</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one of the books that I was reading at the time, Disrupt, or one of the conversations with John Lilly, the lesson was to do the opposite of what you’ve been doing. I was like, okay, I’ve been spending all of this time trying to make startups more design oriented. What if I do the opposite and help designers take the path of entrepreneurship with the thesis being if they get involved earlier on with great engineers and business people, they’ll increase the probability that they could make better designed products and services in the long run. That would also make my job a lot easier rather than trying to parachute in and solve people’s design problems. They would build that core competency in-house.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simultaneously, Ben&#8217;s and my path crossed multiple times, at the Facebook class, Facebook Fund and we even collaborated on projects like peace.facebook.com. We kept in touch felt similar challenges and started to interview over 60 designers that we really respected and tried to understand why aren’t more designers taking this path of entrepreneurship. It kind of boiled down to lack of education, role models and capital. If you look at most of the most of the sources of capital, even going into schools, it’s primarily engineering based. When you look at professors and programs, they weren’t really preparing designers to start companies or to join companies early on. Or to be designers in the way that we expect them to be now. Every designer we spoke to was like, “Hey, if you try to solve this challenge, I’ll help you with time and/or money.” That was really encouraging. All these early conversations with influencers like Scott Belsky and others who said, “Yes, I’ll help.” I just remember thinking back, like, “Wow.” If those people didn’t say, “Yes I’ll help,” and want to pay it forward and give back to the design community, I don’t think that we would have continued on. That eventually led to Ben to take a sabbatical because he was maybe the fifth or sixth designer there and had been there for five or six years. He wanted to take a little break. We started going on hikes like Hidden Villa in Los Altos and then maybe working one day a week and then two days a week and then three, and it turned into all of our time trying to figure out how we can help more designers build businesses with meaningful impact.</span></p>\n<p><b>Walk me through the decision to officially start Designer Fund.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was around 2011 that we were doing the designer interviews. We felt like there was a real need to create a community of designers who were in tech who were building these companies from the ground up or joining early. At the same time, I felt, philosophically, that I wanted to work with less companies. I wanted to have more impact. That means, inherently, there’s just less companies that I can work with. With Dave’s blessing, I wanted to start to focus on Designer Fund full time. Over the course of 2011, I started to progressively decrease my time at 500 Startups and increase my time working on Designer Fund as an independent entity. I’m super lucky that Dave along with a number of other awesome investors were early supporters of Designer Fund. I’m super grateful to Dave McClure, Vinod Khosla, Jonathan Heiliger, Marc Andreessen, Eric Thomas, Shannon Callahan, Dave Morin, Chi-Hua Chien, Brandon Zeuner, Ryan Swagar, Marcus and Andrew Ogawa, John Lilly, Alex Diehl and many others. Folks that, I think, really just believed in the importance of creating an ecosystem and they saw the importance of design and were willing to support different educational events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We then started giving grants to designers who were starting companies. For us it was an awesome way to give back to design community through free events, resources like our </span><a href=\"http://designerfounders.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Designer Founders</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ebook, and through grants. As we moved into 2012, we started to formalize some of those things like writing larger grant check sizes and developing a better system for running different types of events. I think that’s when we even started with our first </span><a href=\"http://designerfund.com/bridge/women-in-design/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women in Design</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> event that </span><a href=\"http://www.mariamolfino.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maria Molfino</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> hosted. We went from mentorship programming to helping set up designers with formal advisorship positions with an equity stake. And also starting to operate as a band of angels where we’d help get our friends to co-invest in companies started by designers. We built on that momentum and then by 2013, we started to realize, “Wow, there’s a huge need need here.” Our inboxes were full of all these designers who are coming to us seeking support in one way or another, from funding, to transitioning to a new opportunity, to improving their career, and then all these companies were coming to us wanting to build their design teams, and so that led to the genesis of Bridge. We had all these great people coming to us but it was just Ben and I. We had to create some better way, a more scalable way of doing this. Previously I had built some internal tools with Kevin Xu, who’s now at Stripe, and the first version of a way for us to help process applications. We had all these applications for designers who wanted grants and so we thought maybe we can repurpose some of this technology to help us process all these applications from designers and all these applications from companies. That was also another big lesson for me, that some of the technology that you build early on, even if it’s scrappy MVP, really could accrue value over time and really magnify and scale your ability to serve people rather than just trying to do everything manually. That is obvious in retrospect. So we went from experiments in 2011 to formalizing events and grants in 2012 and then we launched Bridge and started angel investing in 2013. </span></p>\n<p>Given our mission is to help designers build businesses with meaningful impact, one way of doing that is by helping designers build companies from the ground up as co-founders. What we soon realized was not every designer should be a co-founder, and actually, starting a company from scratch is hard as fuck. It’s so hard. At the same time there’s another path. Designers join existing companies that are doing well and on a growth trajectory. The next Facebook, the next Uber, etc. Joining one of those companies early on, arguably you could have just as much impact and you’re going to have a great experience learning. You’re going to meet a bunch of awesome designers and engineers. You might have a life-changing economic outcome, and just be in a better position to start a company yourself in the future.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On one hand, investing is great to help designers who are ready to be founders. Bridge, on the other hand, is about investing in future design leaders. It also related to our thesis that we believe that companies need to build design at their core. They can’t outsource it. It’s just like you don’t want to outsource your engineering, and great engineers attract other great engineers and so great designers attract other great designers. We felt strongly that helping build and educate design teams would bring a lot of value to companies and help accelerate the growth of designers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we launched Bridge, it was an experiment. We didn’t really know what was going to happen, so I just quickly worked with another designer and mocked up a site and worked on the positioning, but I didn’t spend a ton of time on it. I didn’t know if this was actually going to actually going to work. We partnered with some amazing photographers like you (Helena Price) and with the help of Laura Brunow-Miner and others to try to get perspective of a day in the life and what it’s like to be a designer at some of these top companies. Like Pinterest, Airbnb and Dropbox. Places that we felt truly value design. We’d meet the founders, we’d meet the design team. We’d check out the product. We’d make sure it’s a place where we would want to work ourselves because there’s just so much noise out there.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We believe that companies need to build design at their core.

We felt strongly that helping build and educate design teams would bring a lot of value to companies and help accelerate the growth of designers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And when we launched, it just got an overwhelmingly positive response. Way more demand from companies and designers than we could possibly fulfill. It was profitable since day one and we wanted to see if we could do it again. We ended up running another program that same year in 2013, in the Fall. Again we had amazing results of tons of designers applying, tons of companies wanting to participate. So then we realized that it wasn’t a fluke. Again in 2014 when we launched it again, Bridge 3, there was an amazing response. Our acceptance rate was tougher than Stanford or Harvard. We were really solving a need here for companies to help build and educate the design teams, to help designers accelerate their careers and hopefully become better designers and leaders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And at the same time too, we started to get more and more companies coming to us seeking funding. They knew that we could actually add value and help build and educate design teams. There’s only so much that Ben and I can do as angel investors. There’s only so much we can do by calling up our friends to try to pool our money together to invest in them, so we thought, “Okay, I think we have enough data here that we’re ready to raise our first fund.” That was in 2014. We raised primarily from individual designers, great folks from some of the top companies around the valley, entrepreneurs, a couple of families, our own money and a few institutional funds. Now we’re managing over 20 million and we have a much clearer value proposition for people when they come knocking at our, we can say, “Hey, we can invest between $100K and a million dollars. Our average check size is $250K.” Ultimately we wanted to create a better experience for designer founders and designer entrepreneurs we wanted to partner with.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was 2014. I think looking back, I don’t think we looked like anything else at the time. I don’t think there was any fund that was focused on design. There was no fund that also had this professional development program that was generating revenue and being profitable and had this community of designers. We just looked very unique, I think. Very different compared to the classic fund approaches. We wanted to build this ecosystem. Ben and I aren’t MBAs or coming from stereotypical investors wearing khakis and a button up shirt every day and vests and stuff. I think people were pretty surprised. I don’t think I was aware at the time, so it’s only looking back that I realize there’s not many diverse investors out there. Certainly not at the time from these different design backgrounds. Not at the time from an ethnicity perspective. I just met with a friend recently who told me that he’s been doing some research and there’s only about 30 general partners out there who are Hispanic and I was like, “Uhhhh, oh, okay.’ I didn’t even know that at the time. So if I factor that stuff in, probably the odds weren’t in our favor. We just didn’t have a long investment track record. We didn’t have a traditional background. Didn’t have what people who invest in funds would traditionally look for so thinking back I’m super grateful for all the folks like our advisor, Steve Vassallo, who took a chance on us and believed in our mission and believed in our approach.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ben and I aren’t MBAs or coming from stereotypical investors wearing khakis and a button up shirt every day and vests and stuff.

It was a stretch. It was almost that beginners naïvety. Looking back I don’t even know if I would do it again. Looking back it just doesn’t line up with what the norms at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were a lot of sacrifices too. Ben and I didn’t really pay ourselves. So many nights just working at our dinner table and doing all the classic stuff that I think any start up needs to do. Being super frugal, doing everything that we can to find alternative streams of revenue, engaging our community and a volunteer base. So scrappy. Doing events and getting sponsors and if it wasn’t for them I don’t know if I would pay rent that month. Just all the things that I think any entrepreneur would have to do. Seeing your bank account at zero or negative. In that way I think it was really great for Ben and I to have that deep empathy with all the companies that we invest in. I think it’s important never to lose sight of the struggle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s all this hype that’s going right now and all these folks flocking to Silicon Valley maybe for the wrong reasons. It’s not a lottery ticket. Whereas for us, I don’t think we really ever wanted to be investors just for the sake of being investors. We felt that by investing, we could have a long-term impact with these companies. We could have an equity stake and be long term partners versus just consulting and parachuting in.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There were a lot of sacrifices too.

Where investing is not an end for us. It’s a means for, again, having meaningful impact and ultimately we want better designed products and services in the world. When we say better design, I think of that in a holistic sense. I think of that as an opportunity to impact someone’s life at a really deep level, and the opportunity to have breadth and scale across their life and across the globe. Of course we want to make a ton of money and generate great returns, but we think we can do that in a way that is aligned with our values.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;we have a poster from Facebook&#8217;s hacker way. “We don’t build products to make money, we make money so that we can build better products.” I think that’s always resonated with us.

Our largest investment is in </span><a href=\"http://designerfund.com/bridge/company/stripe-2/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stripe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the global payments platform that’s really empowering commerce and online payments around the world. They’re now allowing anyone to set up US businesses and get that off the ground, it’s just amazing. Another one of our portfolio companies, ZenPayroll which is now re-branded as </span><a href=\"http://designerfund.com/bridge/company/gusto/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gusto</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is helping all these small business owners across the country, many not in tech, run their payroll. That’s really the backbone of the American economy, small businesses. We&#8217;re also investors in companies like </span><a href=\"http://designerfund.com/bridge/company/omada/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Omada Health</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which spun out of IDEO’s health practice. They help prevent people from getting diabetes, which then saves employers money and makes health plans more efficient. It’s like everybody wins. Individuals, the company, society. I just wish I could find ten more of those types of companies in all these different sectors that have, traditionally, been underserved from a user experience standpoint like financial services, education, health, business tools, creative tools. Over time I think we’ve been really blessed and fortunate to have lots of great people around the table to support Ben and I. An approach that we’ve always taken is that we’ve always surrounded ourselves with people that are amazing at what they do. When we first closed our fund, before even starting to invest, I think we interviewed maybe two dozen top investors that we respected and got perspective on what they thought worked and what didn’t work. We’re constantly practicing our own design process on ourselves and on our own business. We’re not just preaching design. We’re actually being hands-on and making our own tools, making our own site, doing a lot of our own stuff. Branding for example. I think it’s important to not lose sight of that. We primarily have been focused on just building, helping our companies and letting the work speak for itself, because I think you just see how there’s so much noise out there. We prefer to focus on the fundamentals of building a product that really solves a consumer’s pain point and need.</span></p>\n<p><b>So, I have a question. In another interview, the idea was brought up that people tend to invest in what they know, and the problems that they can relate to. From your perspective, with your upbringing and being exposed to so many different socioeconomic backgrounds and cultures and not coming from the Silicon Valley pedigree—how does that affect you and what you choose to invest your time and money in?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think there’s a number of companies that we’ve invested, for example ZenPayroll, which is now Gusto. We felt the pain of trying set up our own payroll, and file taxes, and all this back end office stuff. It’s like the last thing that we want to do with, especially when you’re really small. So I think in those cases, we felt that pain. Even creating our free resources like our Designer Founder’s e-book. We used Stripe to process payments. We used some of those tools ourselves as users and that’s one of the things whenever we look at a company—whether or not we’re the target user or not—we really try to use the product, and really dig into all the interactions. Which I think it’s pretty surprising how often most investors don’t do that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most investors aren’t really product focused and don’t really use the product which continues to surprise us. That’s okay, everyone has a different approach. When you start to dig into a product and start to put yourselves in the shoes of the user, even if we’re not deeply familiar with the problem, we can still try to put ourselves in their shoes and experience what that company is building. I think our ability to empathize with folks who are different than us allows us to imagine how a product or service could really impact someone’s life, hopefully for good.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Most investors aren’t really product focused and don’t really use the product which continues to surprise us.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course there’s some things like design tools, for example, like </span><a href=\"http://framerjs.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Framer Studio</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. We invested in them, and it’s like, “Yeah, we totally understand the need to prototype mobile web apps with code. With live data where you can make one change really easily and propagate that to a bunch of other things versus static mockups. We totally get that we’re moving towards a world where we need to build interactive prototypes. Some things like that, it’s really obvious for us to be able to have a point of view on. But then there’s other things where we’re actively looking for things that are outside our comfort zone. What are those areas that are traditionally underserved from a user experience standpoint? What are the industries with old, dinosaur incumbents that don’t really care about the user and just take advantage of them? Insurance, for example. They win based off of advertising campaigns, not on product and not by the user experience. I think there’s so many opportunities like that where because we are naturally curious, we’re going to go explore those spaces even if we don’t intimately know them or have experienced them.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We’re actively looking for things that are outside our comfort zone.

We bring in experts to help us. I’m actually looking for those opportunities where it’s going to be outside of my comfort zone because that’s where design could have the biggest delta or the biggest impact. Of course I’m going to look for the stuff that I know already is obvious. But the non-obvious things are going to be the most exciting things for us. Back to the example with Omada Health. My grandmother and great-grandmother have diabetes. So I remember seeing those needles, and just how horrible that process is. I know that my mom and others are at risk of being diabetic and that I actually was able to get her to go through the Prevent program at Omada, and lose ten pounds so I could see the impact that it was having in my personal life. That being said, we’re still open to finding more opportunities, whether it’s in mental health or other chronic illnesses, that just are totally preventable and with the help of technology we can accelerate prevention. I hope that in the future, we’ll be able to have more alignment with the health industry and the government to be able to even prescribe some of these digital therapeutic technologies.</span></p>\n<p><b>My last question for you would be, just based on the lessons that you&#8217;ve learned, what advice would you have for young entrepreneurs or designers just getting started out in this industry? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One lesson is finding the right partner with complementary skills. Ben and I have really complementary paths. Me going through more of a Stanford HCI and research approach and Ben coming from UCLA with a formalized visual and graphic design approach. Me coming from early stage startups through venture capital firms and Ben coming through the rocket ship of Facebook, one of the most successful tech companies of our time. Another lesson is don&#8217;t underestimate the importance of finding a great opportunity. Just finding a company, a brand where you can learn a ton at, make a bunch of relationships with great engineers, designers, expand your network, and get exposed to what it takes to build a great product and scale it. If you get exposure to that early on it’s going to set you up for so much more in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I want more designers to start companies. But I don’t think that’s always the right path for a lot of people. I think by joining an existing company right before that inflection point of growth, I think there’s a lot of benefit to doing that and I think you’re going to set yourself up to be in better position if you want to start a company in the future. There’s going to be exceptions and people like Joe and Brian who started Airbnb. They came from a very non-traditional route. Joe being an entrepreneur and Brian working at a design consultancy. It’s totally possible to start something when you don’t look qualified. You don’t look like any of the other teams that most investors look at. That’s totally possible but I think those guys were naturally entrepreneurial. If you are going to go that path to entrepreneurship, then I think it’s so important that you find a partner. For me I found Ben. Using the example of Joe and Brian, Airbnb wouldn&#8217;t be possible without their technical founder Nate. It’s so important to find both a design and engineering partner in that early team. I think that’s arguably more important than anything else at those early stages. To summarize, join a successful brand while it’s on its upward trajectory and learn everything you can while you’re there. Or if you are going to start something, really make sure you’re partnering with someone that you can make a long-term commitment to. Like Ben and I have made a minimum 10 year commitment to our mission and to each other. If you can’t make that type of commitment to someone, then maybe reconsider whether or not you want to get married and start a company together.

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b></b><b>So tell me about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born in a small suburb in New Jersey, in Central Jersey, a town called Flemington&#8230;near Princeton. It&#8217;s about an hour and twenty minutes from New York, and an hour on the dot to Philadelphia. Nice little suburban oasis, I suppose, in New Jersey, where like you know, all of our parents worked in one of those cities and that was kind of it. It was extremely homogenous. I&#8217;ll make sure that that&#8217;s known. [laughter] And to give you a sense of to what degree, I went to a high school of about 3000. My graduating class was 760, and in that class of 760 there were ten African-Americans, male and female.</span></p>\n<p><b>Wow.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, I grew up in close proximity to massive cities that had tons of culture, so it never felt—I don&#8217;t know, the lifestyle wasn&#8217;t as representative as you might think from those numbers. It was pretty urban, as much as it could be from a culture and lifestyle standpoint.</span></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s interesting.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a lot of fun.</span></p>\n<p><b>When did you first get interested in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think elementary school. I have a great aunt and uncle that live in my hometown, and my uncle worked for AT&amp;T. As early as I can remember. We had a computer at the house. Like most people my age, I was the reason that we got AOL in the house [chuckles]. It was always very close and accessible for me. I was super curious because I had never seen anything like that in terms of a physical computer. Elementary school had a computer class, I&#8217;m thinking first or second grade, and we&#8217;d just play Oregon Trail and things like that. From an accessibility standpoint, I think it was elementary school and that led me to programming my own role play game in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-86\" target=\"_blank\">TI-86 </a>when I was in sixth or seventh grade. There was a whole other world out there that I wanted to see, and there was access to it through the internet and that was—and still is to some degree—the allure to me.</span></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s amazing. I can&#8217;t even imagine. I didn&#8217;t know tech existed until I was 20 [laughter]. Describe your experience actually getting into tech, then starting your own company.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went to school for economics, so growing up close to New York City, at least in my town, the majority of kids are prone to either go into business or finance. Definitely during the late 80s and early 90s, things were going very very well from an economical standpoint so a lot of people were drawn to that industry. I finished college in 2008 and worked on Wall Street for less than 30 days [laughter]. I knew that it wasn&#8217;t for me. It just wasn&#8217;t what I wanted to spend the majority of my time doing. Thankfully, a sales job opened up at a startup called TheLadders.com. The job market was tough, so I said yes to the position and did B2C sales for about a year, then transitioned over into operations&#8230;and that was my first job within tech. Things started to not go so well at The Ladders a couple of years later, and I saw it coming. One of my co-workers left and moved out to San Francisco to work for <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SurveyMonkey</a>. He sent me over to the job opportunities site and said, &#8220;Hey, if there&#8217;s anything you&#8217;re interested in, let me know.&#8221; There was, and before I knew it, I had put my life in three bags and I was flying across the country to live in San Francisco, a city that I had never visited before in my life [laughter]. But I was twenty-five at the time and I was like fuck it, I&#8217;ll take this risk. I was feeling complacent in New York anyway.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think the analogy of jumping out of an airplane and pulling your chute and hoping that it opens is completely accurate, because you&#8217;re not trained for the things that you&#8217;re going to encompass in trying to launch something.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>How did your family feel about you just up and going?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve always been that way—free, self sustaining. I’m sure they thought  “This is just what Danny&#8217;s doing now.” I always make my own decisions, and I&#8217;ve always been independent in that sense, so there was nothing they could really say. I was going to go regardless.</span></p>\n<p><b>Okay. So you got to San Francisco, you&#8217;d never been.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah.</span></p>\n<p><b>What was it like when you first got here?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly, it was great. I had a really, really positive experience. The same friend that referred me for the job—I moved in with him. We lived in Pac Heights, right off of Clay and Gough, and I lived in Prospect Heights in Brooklyn in New York, so I moved from Brooklyn to essentially the Upper East Side, which was interesting. It was so new. I was in the honeymoon phase, and visually nothing that I was seeing in terms of the topography and all the parks was comparable to anything I had seen in New York or on the East Coast, so it was amazing to me when I first moved out.</span></p>\n<p><b>How were your early years working at startups, before you became an entrepreneur?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know, I think they were net positive in terms of&#8230;there was definitely a learning curve, a pretty significant learning curve because—</span></p>\n<p><b>How big was SurveyMonkey when you joined?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">50.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. Still pretty small.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Super small. Yeah. But as it pertains to—I don&#8217;t know, this might sound a little crazy but the tech companies that were in New York at the time, weren&#8217;t doing amazing work, in my opinion, and SurveyMonkey was great, because it was product focused. TheLadders had a large sales force. We had like 50+ sales people trying to make money for the company, and SurveyMonkey was my first time being exposed to extremely amazing senior leadership, and everyone was so bright, energetic, and passionate about what they were working on, which was an amazing experience for me in that the first bay area company that I got to work for, was this amazing company. But for me, I chose to spend a lot of time outside of work learning, so I could be competitive in the workplace. And it was amazing because they had speakers come in like Sheryl Sandberg and Eric Reese, and that&#8217;s definitely not common [laughter]. Having access to that type of tutelage from those types of folks was amazing, and being able to read things like The Lean Startup helped me learn what the business was like at a product-focused company. That was good.</span></p>\n<p><b>What was the impetus for you deciding to go from employee to entrepreneur? It&#8217;s such a major jump.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. I think the impetus was that I had launched a t-shirt line in college. We&#8217;ll have to go back a little bit. That was my senior year of college, and during that business, myself and my cofounders recorded a mixtape to cross-promote the t-shirt launch [laughter]. We were recording this mixtape and&#8211;</span></p>\n<p><b>I wish more people did that.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[laughter]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So my other friends, they had gone to school for music management and they knew the business—they had a record label, they had artists that they were managing, and they had recording studios. That was my first introduction to studios and studio operations, et cetera. I&#8217;ve been a lifelong musician and I loved it and—</span></p>\n<p><b>What did you play?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I play the alto saxophone.</span></p>\n<p><b>Nice.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, because of Bill Clinton [laughter].</span></p>\n<p><b>Oh man. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Actually I think it was Arsenio Hall at the time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, after we recorded this mixtape, I moved to Brooklyn, but I wanted to continue to either write songs or record a little bit and the process of finding a studio is just ridiculously difficult. And there&#8217;s just tons of friction from the artist side to the studio owners. And at the same time I used this service called <a href=\"https://www.zocdoc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ZocDoc</a>, which is a site that allows anyone to book their next doctor&#8217;s appointment. I figured there should be something like that for musicians, but at the time I had no idea what I needed to do to build a company, let alone a tech company or something that would connect musicians with studio owners. So, that was the driving force behind my startup. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fast forward to when I was at SurveyMonkey—so about 2 and a half years later—I had reached a kind of glass ceiling I&#8217;d say, within SurveyMonkey. I wanted to get into writing my own research, and that was not in their business model at the time. So, you were either an engineer or owned products or business intelligence or sales, and that was kind of it at the time.</span></p>\n<p><b>What year was that ?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2013.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I knew that I was looking for something else. Luckily I found a position at Forrester Research, which kind of offered me that. So I was able to work with clients as a consultant and write my own research. That was nice. I was there for about six months, and got poached by SalesForce to do the same exact thing, just internally. And I hope I&#8217;m not infringing on my safe harbor [laughter]. So I went to SalesForce and did exactly that, just internally. It was myself and my boss and we helped manage all of the internal and external market research, which was awesome and a dream job. But I had been quietly working on my startup that entire time. About six months, seven months into Sales Force, it got to a point where the most important input into the startup—<a href=\"https://www.freshsessions.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Freshsessions</a>—was my time. Things were increasingly—well, my time was increasingly getting marginalized because the gig at SalesForce was a very demanding position.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You figure out how to manage it, and what to focus on. But at the time, you&#8217;re just so overwhelmed and you&#8217;re trying to like bring in so much information. And you&#8217;re reading every article on Inc, TechCrunch, or whatever. And not knowing what to spend your precious attention and energy on, was a huge challenge.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>So you were running both at the same time.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. It was crazy. We had just raised a little bit of money from some friends and family and I had a little bit of an exit, so I had some money from working at SurveyMonkey. Luckily at the time I was dating a girl who was also an entrepreneur and she just kind of told me to take the plunge.  So that was the inspiration, that was the impetus and how that happened.</span></p>\n<p><b>Walk me through what it&#8217;s like to take the plunge into entrepreneurship and the struggles involved, the amazing parts and the bad parts. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think the analogy of jumping out of an airplane and pulling your chute and hoping that it opens is completely accurate, because you&#8217;re not trained for the things that you&#8217;re going to encompass in trying to launch something. All of a sudden you have this free time, you have no manager, [laughter] you don&#8217;t have co-workers, so you have to adjust. If you were someone that worked independently or in a field where you were making your own decisions, I think that it becomes more comfortable for those types of folks, but I didn&#8217;t work in industries or companies like that. For me I had to figure it out while I was in the air. I had to learn how assemble my own parachute. It was interesting because my other two co-founders were still in New York, so I was managing that relationship and all of a sudden my friends went from people that we would just go out and have beers with with and talk about dumb stuff to people that had to inspire and manage. We were inspired to work towards a common goal. So, what I did was spend time reading. I asked all my friends that were in MBA programs what they were learning, what books they were reading, and asked for all the materials I could get from them, and had a little staycation that didn&#8217;t end [chuckles]. I just started reading, and that&#8217;s been part of my process up until now, honestly. I&#8217;ll have to think a little bit more on some specific stories, but the challenges were, for sure, managing friends that now were co-founders, right? But also like figuring out, &#8220;Who&#8217;s building this?&#8221; We had some talent gaps. We had to find contractors to build some front-end work for us. </span></p>\n<p><b>Seems just like a daily battle, but exhilarating.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, for sure. You figure out how to manage it, and what to focus on. But at the time, you&#8217;re just so overwhelmed and you&#8217;re trying to like bring in so much information. And you&#8217;re reading every article on Inc, TechCrunch, or whatever. And not knowing what to spend your precious attention and energy on, was a huge challenge. And that took me like two years to learn, [chuckle] honestly. </span></p>\n<p><b>Related to learning and soaking in all that knowledge, have you had mentors or people that you&#8217;ve looked up to for inspiration along the way?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. But I think the most important source of inspiration has been my other contemporaries—like other friends I have—that have launched companies and learning from them. Even if they have launched a company that was six months ahead of mine, or a year ahead of mine—they still have so much information that could help me save time—most importantly—and money, and help me navigate the landscape more thoughtfully.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t have an official mentor that I check in with consistently. I did have advisors for that first company, so I would check in with them on a monthly basis. But that was it.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where did you build your support network of other entrepreneurs?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Events. Just getting out and showing face. Undoubtedly, you bump into people that are really either interested in you, or what you&#8217;re building, or you just connect on a personal level. And those relationships are extremely important when you&#8217;re trying to do something that either has never been done before, or you&#8217;re doing something that you&#8217;ve never done before and having that support system and people that can relate and either buy into your vision, or offer some feedback is extremely important.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. Where do you think your risk appetite came from? Like, where do you think your motivation comes from? Because not everyone has that, you know?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. I think it&#8217;s twofold. I&#8217;ve been a lifelong athlete, and I think competition is just in me. But in a healthy way, like I don&#8217;t need to be competitive in all aspects of my life—</span></p>\n<p><b>Like the game is fun.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, for sure. For me it&#8217;s fun to exercise that, because it&#8217;s been a part of me since I was five. The second piece is that, although I grew up in a nice area, my family&#8217;s not extremely well off, and things were good when I was growing up—as the oldest—and I was given a lot of opportunity. And I&#8217;ve taken that duty—I guess that opportunity, that access to opportunity as a duty to do as much as I can, take it to the zenith, and try to support my entire family—certainly my immediate family but if I can, cousins, uncles, aunts, etc. So that&#8217;s what motivates me. And I&#8217;ve been gifted in a lot of things. I&#8217;ve figured out how to navigate a lot of different landscapes, so I&#8217;ve been successful in a lot of different areas, and I think if I&#8217;m able to leverage that to help a lot of other people, then I&#8217;ll do so.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do your friends and family feel about the work that you&#8217;ve done and where you are now, all the way on the other coast?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, yeah. So they&#8217;re certainly sad that I&#8217;m all the way in California. I see them maybe three times a year now. But, I think they&#8217;re blown away by what I&#8217;m doing, which is amazing! I think that&#8217;s definitely something I&#8217;ve been conscious of. But I don&#8217;t think they fully understand the path that I&#8217;ve chosen to walk down or folks like me that I&#8217;ve chosen to walk down. My aunt was a teacher, my mom works in a bank, my dad&#8217;s a teacher. It&#8217;s not the same. So I don’t think they fully comprehend, but I try to bring them up to speed as much as possible and stay in touch as much as possible so they can get more of a glimpse into what&#8217;s happening.</span></p>\n<p><b>So tell me about what you&#8217;re working on now. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, so I recently launched a mobile tele-health app called Level, that provides access to psychotherapists. So through our mobile app you can have a session with one of our therapist. The inspiration came back in March or April of 2015, when I used one of our competitors and had a terrible experience—with the service as well as the therapist—that left me feeling like a number. At the time there was a lot of chaos going on in my life and I just needed to figure out how to get to some sort of baseline so I could manage it all. After having that negative experience, I walked away thinking I could build something better. I started doing some research about the industry, what kind of barriers existed, what would work with the current legislative landscape, etc. and it seemed to be a pretty smart time to start a business like ours. So I went out, assembled a team. We have a licensed therapist on our team, and an amazing CTO. Starting in August we&#8217;ve just been churning away and started seeing patients a couple weeks ago.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was feeling pretty depressed and definitely experiencing acute symptoms of anxiety. The first start-up wasn&#8217;t going so well and managing that along with life in general was doing damage that I could not see until it affecting my everyday life. I was trying to do too much and brute force something that wasn&#8217;t working and I should have known to fold a little earlier. But through trying to brute force a business back to life, I started to experience symptoms of different mental health disorders.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Do you have a lot of clientele in tech? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh yeah.</span></p>\n<p><b>I feel like mental health is such an issue and so stigmatized for entrepreneurs.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, you hit the nail on the head. That&#8217;s what was going on in my life in early 2015. I was feeling pretty depressed and definitely experiencing acute symptoms of anxiety. The first start-up wasn&#8217;t going so well and managing that along with life in general was doing damage that I could not see until it affecting my everyday life. I was trying to do too much and brute force something that wasn&#8217;t working and I should have known to fold a little earlier. But through trying to brute force a business back to life, I started to experience symptoms of different mental health disorders, I suppose. I believe a lot of entrepreneurs take the plunge because they have a safety net, and/or an abnormally high tolerance for risk. For me, it was the latter. I think this tolerance for risk stemmed from being able to survive—often thrive—in most circumstances life had thrown my way up to that point. Malcolm Gladwell would probably describe me as a “remote miss” in his book David and Goliath. This&#8230;survivors exhilaration, I believe, is what was driving me to continue to push the business forward, while things—around me were unraveling. And I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s uncommon in the valley. I think there are a lot of entrepreneurs that are feeling the same way. This is certainly something entrepreneurs should be conscious of.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I believe a lot of entrepreneurs take the plunge because they have a safety net, and/or an abnormally high tolerance for risk.

I think this tolerance for risk stemmed from being able to survive—often thrive—in most circumstances life had thrown my way up to that point.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, I still feel this way, where we&#8217;re all pressured to have our peer-face on and be like, &#8220;Everything is great. Everybody&#8217;s great. I&#8217;m great. Look at my Instagram. Look how good my life is. Look at my lifestyle.&#8221; I think it creates a lot of people who feel lonely.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, I can see that.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s like everybody&#8217;s pretending.</span></p>\n<p><b>But how do you manage that? Because you&#8217;re the face of a company. So when the face of the company is so close to what you&#8217;re actually experiencing because it&#8217;s the same person. What parts do you show, right?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. Knowing that people have so much access to you.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. I don&#8217;t know the answer.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. I think some people just either get off the grid, right? They&#8217;re not on Twitter. They&#8217;re not on Instagram.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right. And they don&#8217;t do events, things along those lines. And they just kind of pop up with products.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But yeah. I don&#8217;t know what the answer is.</span></p>\n<p><b>In a similar vein, what has been kind of the hardest or lowest points for you in this whole tech journey? It might be work-related, it might be personal.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Definitely it was personal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So my ex-girlfriend that kind of like gave me this inspiration to take this plunge—it&#8217;s interesting because that part of my life was progressing pretty quickly, and the first start-up was great and going well, reasonably well&#8230;but for about the last six months of the business, it was certainly not going well. And figuring out how to be a good partner and not bring pretty stressful work circumstances into the house was hard to manage, and I didn&#8217;t manage it well, if I did at all. So that was a part of it, but I think ultimately just managing when things aren&#8217;t going well and knowing when to fold, and knowing how to manage a decline because there are things more important, like family and relationships.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all pressured to have our peer-face on and be like, &#8216;Everything is great. Everybody&#8217;s great. I&#8217;m great. Look at my Instagram. Look how good my life is. Look at my lifestyle.&#8217; I think it creates a lot of people who feel lonely.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Yeah. Well, having gone through that myself, it&#8217;s like when your work is your life and it&#8217;s your baby, and your heart, and your soul, and it&#8217;s going really hard, how do you separate yourself? I don&#8217;t know if you can.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t think you can either.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you not bring that home because you are your start up.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exactly. Yeah. I think you try to figure out how to communicate through it. And that&#8217;s probably the largest lesson I learned. How to clearly, objectively communicate—not communicating to prove a point, but to gain understanding and share information the right way. And, yeah that&#8217;s been valuable for me not only in my personal life, but professional as well.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. It’s so nice to have a support network of people who get you, who understand why you&#8217;re an entrepreneur because they&#8217;re similar. I&#8217;m personally very grateful for friends who understand why I would do a hundred interviews [laughter] for some random project in addition to my own work.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don&#8217;t, what else do we have? I&#8217;m sure you feel this way—I don&#8217;t want to speak for you, but I feel this way—if this is something that came into your head and you figured out a plan on how to do it and you think it&#8217;s a worth-while cause, do it. To not to is like&#8230;</span></p>\n<p><b>Exactly. You just got to do it. </b></p>\n<p><b>How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? You&#8217;ve been in it for a little while and you&#8217;ve seen change—what are you pumped about and what are you frustrated with?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am pumped that there is a huge push into increasing accessibility to different groups of people, I won&#8217;t even say minorities, I think it&#8217;s just people in general. Not only from the standpoint of getting access into jobs at certain companies, but learning different skills, or even having internet for the first time in their lives—when you start to think internationally. I think that is going to breed amazing opportunities, products, and services that are not only useful, but are just really really cool because so many different types of people have access to the tools to create things.  so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m most excited about. And I&#8217;m excited that there are a lot of companies that operate on massive scales to actually make an impact—like Facebook or Google for, example. What I&#8217;m most frustrated with is—I think it&#8217;s a product of people being able to quickly create products or solve problems—but I don&#8217;t think people are working on great things. And maybe that&#8217;s some kind of bourgeois comment, but I see a lot of BS companies getting getting worked on. This is valuable time. I would much rather spend time thinking a little bit more and working on something that impacts people&#8217;s lives versus the next sophomoric Uber for X app. There actually is an Uber for puppies going around. Yes, people love puppies, but at the same time, spending a little bit more time in trying to create something that increases a lot of value or injects a lot of value into people&#8217;s lives is far more worthwhile to me.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is valuable time.

I know they just had to lay off a decent amount of folks, but increasing access to sustainable foods, and employing a lot of people in the process, is pretty cool to me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And I think they did a good job from a branding perspective as well. The whole package is pretty cool.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are some of the biggest lessons you&#8217;ve learned while you have worked in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ask, &#8220;why?&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And this is—I&#8217;m just really interested in getting to the root of things, and the more that you ask, &#8220;why?&#8221; , the less time there is for the opportunity there is from miscommunication and I&#8217;ve already mentioned I&#8217;m pretty big on communication now. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secondly, act fast and ask for forgiveness not for permission. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly—this is a life motto—find your passion and inspire. I believe fulfillment is inevitable with this motto in mind. That has certainly been true for me. I&#8217;ve always had a passion for helping people and I think that is what led me to launch this second company.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, I love that. I love that both of your projects are autobiographical in a way you know it’s like—</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, they are.</span></p>\n<p><b>—it’s like you’ve created something essentially for yourself, like to resolve a problem within yourself and so like you&#8217;re kind of your own primary case study. I just feel like, I wouldn’t do this project if it didn’t have something to do with me. I just feel like the really high-quality work comes from personal experience.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Absolutely I agree.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in five or ten years? Do you think you’ll still be here? You seem to love San Francisco. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I like San Francisco. No, I do. I love San Francisco but I can’t spend all of my time here. I just know what it is and I love it for what it is, but at the same time it leaves me yearning for things that it’s not—and instead of speaking in the abstract—and it leaves me yearning for diversity in my day-to-day life. Not just racially but socio-economically as well. Although I love the area and all that it can offer in a three-hour radius and all the amazing things that I can do. There are very few places in the world that you can have access to that type of stuff, those types of opportunities. I’d like to have a home here, but probably not stay here year round. So then I start to think about where else I might go and I don’t think there’s anywhere else in the US, I&#8217;ve done New York, I love New York.</span></p>\n<p><b>Me too.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I&#8217;m not ready to get back yet. Europe I think is probably next.</span></p>\n<p><b>I totally understand where you&#8217;re coming from. In this project even I feel very prompted to just talk about how it&#8217;s not just a problem of recruiting. It&#8217;s a problem of keeping, in terms of diverse folks. It&#8217;s not just the pipeline problem. It’s that people come, and then they leave because it doesn&#8217;t feel quite right and I don&#8217;t know what the solution is, but I just feel like it&#8217;s worth talking about.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You&#8217;re right. I think it&#8217;s certainly changing because—I was vocal about this when I first moved here. Just having access to the lifestyle I had when I lived in New York took a long while to find. When I moved here there weren&#8217;t bars that played amazing music. A lot of the bars, if they played music, it was super corny [laughter].</span></p>\n<p><b>New York restaurant music is astronomically better.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And people don&#8217;t dance here. Well, they do now, but not as much. Exactly, you know [laughter]! But I think people are recognizing that and there are amazing companies like <a href=\"http://www.toastedlife.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Toasted Life</a>, for example, which some of my friends own, that cater to black millennials, and they put on awesome events at venues in the Bay Area, and they play awesome music. The more that people do things like that, the more palatable living in San Francisco will be for people moving from other cities and countries.</span></p>\n<p><b>One of my favorite things about New York—I lived there, just for a little bit. Every time I go back there, it definitely feels more culturally vibrant and diverse, but there&#8217;s more equalizers, like the subway. Everybody rides the subway. Everybody eats dollar slices of pizza late at night. Everybody gets bagels. I just feel like the lifestyles converge, of everyone, at certain points. I still use public transportation here, because I live next to a BART station, but I don&#8217;t feel like there are those unplanned collisions in the same way here.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not at all. Where would they be, you know?</span></p>\n<p><b>What advice would you give  to folks from similar backgrounds to yours and similar perspectives to yours who are hoping to get into tech? Or in tech now and are struggling?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think—and I&#8217;m speaking from experience because this has helped me—I think dedicating yourself to learning helps you dedicate yourself towards growth. </span>The only way that you achieve growth—in my opinion—consciously is through consistent effort to learn new things and step outside of your comfort zone.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So I would recommend folks that are trying to get into tech to definitely try to learn as much as possible, but also step outside of their comfort zone often because again, that&#8217;s where the growth is. And this is a place where you&#8217;re consistently expected to create things that don&#8217;t exist yet, so you&#8217;re going to need to figure out how to be comfortable in that space because it&#8217;s not a comfortable space initially.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The only way that you achieve growth—in my opinion—consciously is through consistent effort to learn new things and step outside of your comfort zone.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So—if you&#8217;re currently in tech—I recommend to </span>work on worthwhile problems. Don&#8217;t waste your time at a company or working on a project that  you don&#8217;t believe in. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clearly, there&#8217;s some leeway there, right? But ultimately if you can align yourself with a company that has similar values as you, then you can be confident in the majority of the work—or the net of the work—that you do is going to be positive and be in the same direction that you would already be going. I think, again, that that breeds quality, but I also think it breeds happiness because you&#8217;re working on problems you care about and it increases the likelihood you&#8217;re going to ultimately end up fulfilled&#8230;versus going to some other company and hitting the same type of keyboard, but working on something you don&#8217;t believe in, and in two or three years you&#8217;re not going to feel fulfilled about how you used your time. And your time is very, very precious.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Work on worthwhile problems. Don&#8217;t waste your time at a company or working on a project that  you don&#8217;t believe in.&#8221;</p></blockquote>",

Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I grew up in the Midwest first in Pennsylvania until I was 9 &#8211; and then Ohio, and I started programming in high school. During Sophomore year I decided to be lazy and take an extra study hall, but the computer science teacher, Mrs. Petite, hunted me down, along with all the other advanced math students, and said “You should take my class,” and I’m so glad she did.  I took two and a half years of computer science in high school and just absolutely loved it. My first class was in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic\">Visual Basic</a>, and I made the video game <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger\">Frogger</a> as my final project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of my sophomore year I was very nervous, I knew that my school had AP computer science courses but I wasn&#8217;t sure if I would be good at it.  I asked my teacher Mrs. Petite who said, &#8220;Of course you would be. Sign up.&#8221; So I did. I took AP computer science A junior year in C++ and AP computer science B senior year in Java. </span><b> </b>I fell in love with programming in high school, I loved how quickly I could bring my ideas to life, and so I went into college knowing I wanted to major in computer science.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I fell in love with programming in high school, I loved how quickly I could bring my ideas to life, and so I went into college knowing I wanted to major in computer science.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>How was college for you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College was great! I always knew from a young age that I wanted to do engineering or math or science based things. I just liked them in addition to a healthy appreciation of the art.  I spent a lot of time writing, reading literature and dabbling painting and pottery. But I had a penchant for the sciences, so when I applied to colleges I focused on schools with computer science departments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I eventually chose Cornell University in Ithaca, New York which has a really excellent computer science program.  It is a super tough program but it was really fun. I have some best friends from that program that I still very close with even though we live in different cities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In college I also TA’d a class that was the Intro to Data Structures course in Java.  I also became interested in game design and built a couple video games, via an elective program.  I was also incredibly interested in computer graphics because I liked the idea that I could visualize or see what I was making and create art. I also came to realize that I was really bad at linear algebra, or not really bad but I was never going to be great at it, so then I thought maybe I should pick a different area to focus on.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During college I interned at bunch at different places including <a href=\"https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/\">Stanford’s Linear Accelerator Center </a>(SLAC) and Microsoft. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At SLAC I had my first introduction to large scale computing.  They had, at the time, one of the larger academic computing clusters that the scientists working at the accelerator could use to analyze and compute all the data they were collecting.  In order to do this they needed massive compute, and I worked on the team there that provided it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also did a more traditional internship after my junior year at Microsoft, in Seattle.  I worked on Windows Live Experiences which was how I got involved with networking and found a passion for building things that socially connect people.  </span></p>\n<p>When choosing a full time job after college I really wanted to work in Video Games.  I wasn’t exactly sure what area of computer science I wanted to focus in so I figured I might as well just build something that I think is fun. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I ended up landing at Microsoft in Microsoft Studios because I got an offer to work on the Gears of War Series, an Xbox Game.    </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;When choosing a full time job after college I really wanted to work in Video Games.  I wasn’t exactly sure what area of computer science I wanted to focus in so I figured I might as well just build something that I think is fun.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>So let&#8217;s dig into those first experiences. How was working Seattle? How was working in games?</b></p>\n<p>I loved working in games. I&#8217;m really glad I did it in my early 20s. I&#8217;m also really glad I&#8217;m done, or am on a break from the industry at least for awhile, because it is pretty exhausting.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The crazy hours you hear about are 100% true, but I learned so much in those first six/seven years I spent in games because you just work all the time.</span> I loved it and I was having a blast so I don&#8217;t regret any of it, just sometimes your priorities change away from just work as you get older.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I loved working in games. I&#8217;m really glad I did it in my early 20s. I&#8217;m also really glad I&#8217;m done, or am on a break from the industry at least for awhile, because it is pretty exhausting.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I worked on Gears of War 2 which was a phenomenal opportunity straight out of college that doesn&#8217;t happen in the games industry that often. So I got very lucky and I worked my ass off. </span>We were working 60+ hours a week as soon as I started, and I remember sleeping on the floor to finish builds and taking naps as things were compiling. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Game builds actually take a really long time because you have to compile the assets down and then package it into something the Xbox knows how to run. There&#8217;s this xkcd comic of, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s compiling&#8221; and that&#8217;s a real joke in the game industry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I then continued to work in the Gears of War franchise on Gears of War 3.  As we were working on that—an internal studio instead of Microsoft—<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/343_Industries\">343 Industries</a> was created to take over the Halo franchise from Bungie, the studio that created Halo.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We were working 60+ hours a week as soon as I started, and I remember sleeping on the floor to finish builds and taking naps as things were compiling.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2009, I was loaned out to 343 to work on one of the first title applications on the Xbox360, Halo Waypoint.  Originally on the Xbox360, you had this standard dashboard and all you could really do on the console was play games, I don&#8217;t know if people remember that, this was a while ago. And then they added the applications like Netflix, Hulu, Youtube, etc&#8230;. Halo Waypoint was also one of the first of what we call title applications, that came out.  It was very new, and I jumped on it because I thought that was really exciting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the Halo Waypoint project, I learned that 343 Industries had positions open, so I moved over to that studio full time when it was about 40 or 50 people. I was Web Service Developer number 2 that they hired, so that was pretty cool because we got to take over this whole charter of the Halo universe. I was really young, only 23, so this was an amazing opportunity, so I just ran with it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Halo was really fun, it was this crazy wonderful experience. It was very career-defining for me. It&#8217;s definitely the biggest thing I&#8217;ve done at this point. We re-wrote all of the Halo services in <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure</a>, which is Microsoft&#8217;s cloud compute. We also built a lot of it on top of this Microsoft Research technology called <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/orleans/\" target=\"_blank\">Orleans.</a> The Orleans team was amazing we approached them and said, &#8220;Hey, we like your stuff. We would like to build all of the Halo services. Will you work with us?&#8221; and they were crazy enough to say, “Yes.”  Then we were crazy enough to think we could do this so we did it and it was amazing. It really led me to love, not only games and creating the social aspects of it, but also introduced me to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing\" target=\"_blank\">Distributed Systems</a>.  </span></p>\n<p><b>What was it like to be a woman in the Game Industry?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s obviously a lot of controversy going on about the games industry now. Everyone knows about all the harassment, especially a lot of women are facing in that industry, especially online, and all the horror stories that are coming out. </span>I actually had a very positive experience, at least with my studio. I attribute a lot of that to the fact that Bonnie Ross is the studio General Manager, and she runs all of Halo at Microsoft. And then the executive producer of Halo 4 was Kiki Wolfkill, another really fantastic woman. And so, when I joined the studio, I was literally joining a studio run by women, and it was fantastic. I think it just set the tone. Even on little things like t-shirt orders always included female-sizes even when we were only ordering like 30 shirts, things like that. The studio always felt very inclusive.</p>\n<p>Trade shows were a little different. People would come up to me and say, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re not in marketing?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No dude, I make the game.&#8221;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And that was always surprising to people.  I used to count the number of times a person said “Really?” I got up to five once.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I actually had a very positive experience, at least with my studio.

What was the impetus?</b></p>\n<p>Some of it was just—I&#8217;d been at Microsoft for five, six years, something like that. Problems start looking more of the same and there was just some things I wanted to go explore outside in other parts of the industry. I was also very burnt out. To be perfectly honest, I was working really long hours even after we shipped Halo 4.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shipping Halo 4 was one of the most magical, sleep-deprived, wonderful experiences of my life.  I loved every minute of it and leaving Halo in 2015 was really hard, but sometimes you get to a point where you want to do or explore other things. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I then did a year at HBO, which started up a studio in Seattle.  Essentially I was working on what became HBO Now.  I stayed there for only a year.  It wasn&#8217;t the best culture fit for me.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So then I made the decision to move to San Francisco.  I knew a lot of people in San Francisco. I was super excited by the tech scene, just because a lot of stuff is happening and it&#8217;s interesting. So I started looking around and interviewed with literally everyone [chuckles]. I had a bunch of job offers from some really amazing places but ended up deciding on taking a job at Twitter, and so that&#8217;s where I am now.</span></p>\n<p><b>What excites you in your work now? Is there a thread across all your work, from games to Twitter?  </b></p>\n<p>I really love Distributed Systems.  The space is developing really quickly as applications have to scale to handle larger amounts of data that’s globally distributed.  In addition we now expect services to be always on.  Down time isn’t acceptable.  So there are a lot of really hard problems in this space, and a lot of overlap between research and industry that really excites me.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also love Twitter as a platform.  Just like games, I’m helping to build social connected experiences that bring people together. I’ve learned a lot on Twitter, and made some really close friends who I first connected with via Twitter.  I also think Twitter does a lot of good in the world, giving people a voice.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I really love Distributed Systems.  The space is developing really quickly as applications have to scale to handle larger amounts of data that’s globally distributed.  In addition we now expect services to be always on.  Down time isn’t acceptable.  So there are a lot of really hard problems in this space, and a lot of overlap between research and industry that really excites me.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>How did you get into speaking and writing?  How has that experience been for you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I kind of got pushed into speaking actually.  I’ve been very fortunate in my career to have a bunch of people who have sponsored me.  So at Microsoft, Clemens Vasters and Scott Hanselman sought me out and encouraged me to come talk on their podcasts.  I also have a friend Kate Matusdaria who made the intro that led to my first conference talk at Surge 2014.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also got invited to speak at Ordev 2014 basically because I got into a heated argument on Twitter with Kelly Sommers and some folks from the Node.js community about Orleans.  Afterwards one of the conference organizers reached out to me saying, “We are really interested in learning more about Orleans and saw the conversation on Twitter, would you like to come talk about it.”  So I responded &#8220;I guess, sure. That sounds great.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My first conference talks went over very well, from those came more talk invitations and most recently an article on <a href=\"http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/2/197420-the-verification-of-a-distributed-system/abstract\" target=\"_blank\">The Verification of a Distributed System</a> that was published in the Communications of the ACM.  </span></p>\n<p><b>What&#8217;s it been like being a senior-level woman in Tech in Silicon Valley? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s definitely hard, and it gets harder as you get more senior I think.  But I’m in tech because all the toys I want to play with are here, and I love the work I do, so I’m here for the long haul.  </span></p>\n<p>Most days it is fine but every now and then there are things that grate on you.  There’s a lot of little things, like getting offered “uni-sex” aka men’s sized shirts.  Or people being surprised when you say I’m a Tech Lead.  Then there are some people who want to see your credentials.  At this point I’m just like, “Do you need a moment to Google me, hold on I’ll wait.” <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Honestly the reason I’ve been hustling so hard the past few years, all the talks and articles outside of my day to day job, helps with my visibility/credibility in the industry.  It makes it easier to show up, because some people already know your name.  </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Most days it is fine but every now and then there are things that grate on you.  There’s a lot of little things, like getting offered &#8216;uni-sex&#8217; aka men’s sized shirts.  Or people being surprised when you say I’m a Tech Lead.  Then there are some people who want to see your credentials.  At this point I’m just like, &#8216;Do you need a moment to Google me, hold on I’ll wait.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Where have you traditionally found your support networks, and where do you find them now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My family has always been a huge support.  In the tech community I’ve met a lot of friends via IRC and Twitter, I know that sounds super nerdy.  One of my best friends, Ines Sombra, I knew because of Twitter and we met for coffee when I was in the process of moving down to San Francisco.  There is also a group of people I know from IRC channels, where we talked about distributed systems, and since have become friends.  I’m really grateful for all of them because I have a really strong network of women and men who are very supportive, who get it, who have my back, and I think that is really important for staying in the tech industry.  I do not know how I would do it otherwise.  </span></p>\n<p><b>How do you think your background and family and support networks and life experiences impact the way that you approach your work? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mother has always had a career, a very strong one, she’s currently a Director at the US Department of Transportation right now, and has been CFO at companies.  She&#8217;s always been managing teams and directors of them, and implementing these big projects. You know, just seeing her out there doing that makes me believe I can.  So her career definitely influenced me early on to also want that for myself.   </span></p>\n<p><b>Have you had other specific role-models in your life? People that have inspired you? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like </span>I owe quite a bit to my high school Computer Science teacher, Caroline Petite.  If she hadn’t encouraged me to take her class, I probably wouldn’t be where I am today. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Her passion for programming and teaching really inspired me.  I still stay in touch with her via Twitter it’s great, she’s fantastic. </span></p>\n<p>Of course Barbara Liskov, one of the greats of distributed systems, and one of only two women to win the Turing Award.  Also Nancy Lynch, she wrote one of the canocical distributed algorithms books, and has done foundational research in the space.  Just seeing them out there excelling in the space is inspiring to me.  I hope I get to meet them one day.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I owe quite a bit to my high school Computer Science teacher, Caroline Petite.  If she hadn’t encouraged me to take her class, I probably wouldn’t be where I am today.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then there are the women I know more personally who inspire me; Camille Fournier, Ines Sombra, Jessie Frazelle, Charity Majors, Jill Wetzler, Elaine Greenberg, all these women in tech inspire in different ways, and I’m lucky to count them as friends.  </span></p>\n<p><b>What really excites you about tech right now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So </span>I get really excited about academia and industry partnerships.  I think we are in a very fortunate time where these key partnerships are starting to happen, because I think we’ve hit the sweet spot where the industry actually faces some of the problems that academia is trying to solve in distributed systems. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In the 70s and 80s when some of the canonical distributed systems papers were written people were still running things on one machine, so it wasn’t as applicable to industry at that point. </span></p>\n<p>I have been fortunate in my career to work with some wonderful researchers like The Orleans Team at Microsoft Research.  I also am lucky to get to chat with academics like Peter Bailis and Peter Alvaro and pick their brains, and hopefully partner with them sometime in the future.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So </span>I get really excited about academia and industry partnerships.  I think we are in a very fortunate time where these key partnerships are starting to happen, because I think we’ve hit the sweet spot where the industry actually faces some of the problems that academia is trying to solve in distributed systems.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>What would you like to see change in Silicon Valley?</b></p>\n<p>I think Hero Culture is really harmful.  The idea of this one awesome developer who jumps in and saves the day, or founded the entire company, or wrote an open source library all on their own.  I get that it’s a good story, but I’m always skeptical when I hear them, because I’m like did they really or is this just the myth we are telling?</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also think Hero Culture can be really toxic to teams.  It doesn’t foster a collaborative environment.  It’s not helping other engineers on your team grow, especially the junior engineers.  It also creates single points of failures and bottle-necks in your organizations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But hey, it’s a good narrative.  Who doesn’t like a good story where the hero comes in and saves the day. It’s a much easier story to package and sell versus the team of complicated individuals that had to band together to do something.  </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think Hero Culture is really harmful.  The idea of this one awesome developer who jumps in and saves the day, or founded the entire company, or wrote an open source library all on their own.  I get that it’s a good story, but I’m always skeptical when I hear them, because I’m like did they really or is this just the myth we are telling?&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in five or ten years? You&#8217;ve mentioned you&#8217;ll stay in tech, but what do you think you&#8217;ll be up to? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m really indecisive right now about what I want to do next.  Part of me wants to go and travel and work for a while.  In tech we are really lucky that you can find a job that will let you do this and work from wherever you want, and I think that would be an amazing experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long term, I would like to work on more teams where industry and academia are working together.  I think I’m particularly strong in that area, I learn very quickly and understand how much tech we need to solve a business problem.  I hope to keep doing hardcore distributed systems.  I find this area really fascinating, and I don’t think it is going to run out of problems to solve any time soon.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly the answer to this question changes constantly.  I guess I just hope I’m always learning and expanding my knowledge. I want to keep sharing what I know, having fun doing it, and feel like I’m working on worthwhile projects that make some positive impact on society whether it’s entertaining people or helping facilitate communication.  </span></p>\n<p><b>Lastly, what advice would you have for women in tech who are hoping to follow in the same kind of path?</b></p>\n<p>You just have to be stubborn right now.  You have to realize that it’s not really fair, and it’s going to be hard.  I know you aren’t supposed to say that but it’s the reality of the situation.  If you consistently show up, do good work, and find a supportive group of people, you can do well.  It may take switching jobs a couple of times, and that’s ok, you don’t owe anyone anything, find a place that’s right for you.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s this great </span><a href=\"http://www.glamour.com/entertainment/2015/08/mindy-kaling-guide-to-killer-confidence\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interview with Mindy Kaling</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where she talks about confidence.  She says “Confidence is just entitlement,” and that you earn it by you showing up, working hard, and earning your entitlement.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taylor Swift also summed this up well in her </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPOPtQIEQt0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">acceptance speech at the 2016 Grammys</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> saying, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;but if you just focus on the work and you don’t let those people sidetrack you, someday when you get where you’re going, you’ll look around and you’ll know it was you and the people who love you who put you there and that will be the greatest feeling in the world.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I think that’s the advice, you just have to show up, do really good work, find the people who love and support you, recognize it is probably not fair, and be a little stubborn.  </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You just have to be stubborn right now.  You have to realize that it’s not really fair, and it’s going to be hard.  I know you aren’t supposed to say that but it’s the reality of the situation.  If you consistently show up, do good work, and find a supportive group of people, you can do well.  It may take switching jobs a couple of times, and that’s ok, you don’t owe anyone anything, find a place that’s right for you.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>So tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born in New York. My mom and dad lived in a bad neighborhood and then I think my dad caught someone pulling a TV, their TV out of their apartment at one point, and then they decided to move to the suburbs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suburbs are what? Only 30 miles away from where they were in New York, but it&#8217;s a world apart. It&#8217;s really the kind of place where someone like me can grow up, and just not quite fit in. I think that was really important to my development, because it got me really used to thinking for myself. That&#8217;s been really the most satisfying thirty-something-year arc in my life going from public schools in New Jersey, all the way to corporate publishing jobs to doing my own things that are weird and special in their own way and loved for that. That&#8217;s been a really big trend in my life, just that feeling of not quite agreeing with the crowd. I started understanding that in New Jersey.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;That&#8217;s been a really big trend in my life, just that feeling of not quite agreeing with the crowd.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>What was it like? You are first-generation American on both sides, right?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I&#8217;m one-and-a-half. My mom has a really thick Queens accent. She went to fashion school in New York she designed jeans in the &#8217;80s for Jordache. My dad is from Hong Kong and was a computer engineer for Hewlett Packard in the &#8217;80s.</span></p>\n<p><b>What did your parents expect of you growing up? What did they think you were going to do?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My parents really didn&#8217;t expect anything, and that was maddening at times. When you&#8217;re a kid, you get put into music lessons. I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do this,&#8221; and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; That&#8217;s not a normal reaction for stereotypical Chinese parents. They were letting us do whatever we wanted to. It&#8217;s reflected in the professions of all my brothers. One of my brothers is a musician. Another brother is a furniture maker. That has led to us having not a ton of guidance or structure. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My dad had a really overbearing dad and overbearing older brother, so he never wanted to tell us what to do, as a matter of principle. My mom was just really into being a free spirit. She let us do our own thing. To be honest, when I was younger, that really came off as not giving us enough support, direction. I don&#8217;t think people become really, really excellent without some sort of pressure, and that was kind of the pressure that I was given. It wasn&#8217;t ever pressure to get good grades. It wasn&#8217;t pressure to be a doctor. It wasn&#8217;t pressure to do anything and except be myself and do what I wanted to do. It’s a lot of responsibility to listen to what yourself and find out what’s right for you, without anyone programming you for that.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It’s a lot of responsibility to listen to what yourself and find out what’s right for you, without anyone programming you for that.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>You mentioned that going to school in New Jersey was weird. Tell me more.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think it was like subtly racist in a way that it just is. In a way that&#8217;s not explicit, and I think there&#8217;s a weird social dynamic there. That&#8217;s part of why I moved to Hawaii. It&#8217;s like I don&#8217;t need to be a minority anymore. And I really carry that confidence with me that I get from living in a place where I&#8217;m not a minority, all the time. New Jersey was just kind of very racist, very classist. It was just like not where I belonged. I&#8217;m into deep urban-ness, or I&#8217;m into nature, but I&#8217;m not into this gray mushy zone in between, that&#8217;s kind of what the suburbs were for me.</span></p>\n<p><b>What were your inclinations as a kid? Did they skew technological? Did they skew towards writing?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My father was an engineer, and we didn&#8217;t play sports. We would build remote-controlled cars, and I built my first by myself at 7, and the 16-year-old guy across the street couldn’t figure out how to build his, so I knew I was kind of a nerd by that time. We played around computers, and went shopping for gadgets in Hong Kong during my summers. I just had an aptitude for writing and reading when I was younger. I think, I&#8217;m actually at the same reading a comprehension level, now that I did when I was seven. Can you imagine not being any better reading when you&#8217;re 39 than when you were seven years old? It&#8217;s like bizarre.</span></p>\n<p><b>Tiny genius Brian.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t know if genius is the thing. It’s like, “why haven&#8217;t you got any smarter since you were seven?&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><b>I like the bird sounds that are happening on that side of the audio.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s funny that you can hear that. There&#8217;s parrots here. I think they filmed some Elvis movie that had green parrots, and then they released them at the end of the filming and then they started breeding. It’s this weird invasive, beautiful parrot species that lives in my neighborhood. </span></p>\n<p><b>Walk me through the windy path that got you into tech, and your editorial career in tech.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t even know—I don&#8217;t consider myself in tech. I went to college in Boston and I switched majors about six times, and I took summer school every summer to catch up, but I never did, and ended up with—you needed 100 credits to graduate and I had 150 by the time I was done. I went from Philosophy to English to Journalism to Photojournalism to Computer Science to Business with an IT slant on it. I was pretty good at photojournalism and really fast in the dark room. Then one day this journalist comes in from the Boston Globe and this was like 1999, so it was beginning of a pretty dark age for newspapers. They could see the internet coming. This one veteran was like, &#8220;80% of you won&#8217;t get jobs and 20% of you who will will work 80 hours a week for $20,000 a year. It&#8217;s going to be bad.&#8221; And the same week this artist woman that I was madly in love with said, &#8220;Well, I want to be an artist, so I&#8217;m probably going to have to marry someone who&#8217;s financially responsible.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Alright, maybe I should go to business school.&#8221; So I transferred because I was a pretty reckless, idiotic, romantic young person.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I didn&#8217;t like it at all in business school. I didn&#8217;t fit in. I didn&#8217;t have nice clothes. And I didn&#8217;t do great. But then it was like 2000, and I got a job at this small web-development firm, and within two months of getting that job I got laid off from the bubble bursting. There were no jobs. So in San Francisco I remember, like, seven people who were let go were crying and then I was just like, &#8220;Thanks for the job, it was really nice meeting you.&#8221; I just kind of knew that I wasn&#8217;t supposed to be doing that kind of work. Plus a couple times I got in trouble for reading about gadgets online, I don&#8217;t know why, but it was just interesting foreshadowing.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t like it at all in business school.

And I didn&#8217;t do great.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went to work at my boxing gym at the time that I&#8217;d just joined. I&#8217;d always had a really strong affinity for martial arts. I joined this gym, and I went from answering phones and signing people up and sweeping the floors to eventually teaching. That took like 3 or 4 years and I think I learned a lot in that gym about hustle and working hard. I was so happy, just sweeping the floors and exercising like 5 hours a day, 6 days a week and getting into really good shape, making like 5 or 6 dollars and hour. My life was really simple. At one point, I started to just notice like, philosophically, I was not that aligned with this concept of fighting all the time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I remember fighting with this woman who became a professional later, she punched me in the nose, and then she was like, &#8220;Do you want a tampon?,&#8221; it was like the constant joke, my nose used to bleed all the time. So, I just started to realize people in the gym were kind of crazy in a way that I didn&#8217;t necessarily want to be. Also, fighters don&#8217;t age well, they get beaten-up, and you get brain damage, and they start slurring their speech and it&#8217;s just really rough. I saw the writing on the wall, but at some point it really came together when the owner of the gym was hurt as badly as can be.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I went to work at my boxing gym at the time that I&#8217;d just joined.

The professionals, who trained in the afternoon, were practicing when all a sudden we hear this crash. Out in front, some guy in this like Jeep Cherokee—he looked like a total techie yuppie, some redheaded nerdy dude—had taken his green Jeep and backed it into a car that happened to belong to the owner of the gym, Alex Gong. He was a professional fighter. I think his fight name was F-14, as in the jet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The techie put his car in drive and took off down Clementina Street into 5th. Alex being Alex, super combative, professional fighter, super aggressive dude, chases after him wearing boxing shorts and no shirt. I think he took off his boxing gloves, I don&#8217;t know. Chases him down. The guy gets stuck in traffic on 5th by the highway entrance. I chase after him with a camera because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m starting to be a journalist. Let me take a photo of the license plate.&#8221; So I run a block, I catch up and I see Alex reaching into the car and getting the guy to try to pull over by taking his keys out. The light turns green, and I hear, &#8220;Pop,&#8221; and I see Alex fall down. Alex was shot in the chest by this totally yuppie looking guy. The guy took off. Some witnesses got the license plate. A cop showed up immediately, but Alex was dead on the ground. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t remember what I did. Somehow I told the people at the gym that Alex had gotten shot. I don&#8217;t know if I had a cellphone back then. Alex was lying in the middle of the street, wearing boxing shorts and I was the only one there who knew him. The cop said, &#8220;You should give him CPR.” I&#8217;m like &#8220;He&#8217;s got blood and vomit all over his mouth.&#8221; He&#8217;s like &#8220;use your t-shirt as a mask&#8221; So I used my t-shirt and I gave him CPR but in my head, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;He&#8217;s so dead, there&#8217;s not even any blood coming out of his wound on his chest.&#8221; I just knew he was dead. There was no reviving him. He was shot around the chest, around the heart.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For me, the entire situation can be summed up as live by the sword, die by the sword. So we grieved, and nobody really took the lesson the way that I did. And my lesson was you have to find a way that&#8217;s not as conflict-oriented in life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From then I just really started putting energy into my work life. I took the tools from the gym, the work ethic, the hustle, the pacing, the style, the strategy and I put it towards work. I would just work so hard and I got whatever job I wanted eventually, even if I had to apply a few times.

And for five years it was not that different from boxing; being punched in the face every day was actually easier than working at Gawker. It was like so combative internally, so combative externally and you burn all these bridges and you just piss everyone off. But you’re doing that to get the story and get it fast.

I think as a journalist you have a lot of common sense and you have a good nose for bullshit, and you need to do stuff that you believe in. The Wirecutter was a concept I could really believe in, but I also knew that, because it was so kind of radical at the time, people were like, &#8220;How are you going to be ranked on Google? How are you going to make traffic so you can make ad money?&#8221; My pitch was like we are going to ignore a lot of noise and only be updated 10 times a month at most.

God bless them. I just also knew that in publishing, you can&#8217;t apply those kind of models of extreme growth that you can get from launching a free app that has a free service that grows so fast because it&#8217;s all free. You know, like you can&#8217;t match that with content. Content&#8217;s pretty expensive. Anyone who says it’s not is doing garbage. It just doesn&#8217;t grow the same way, and if it does it&#8217;s growing because of kind of tricks. So, to do something that&#8217;s really high quality, you need to allow it to grow very slow in a way that&#8217;s not compatible with most modern, tech-oriented VC, and that&#8217;s basically what we&#8217;ve done.

So we are not here to make traffic, or be a big media company, or be fancy. We&#8217;re just trying to be really useful for people. Shopping really sucks. Everyone has a couple things we&#8217;re really excited to shop for, whether that&#8217;s leather jackets or surfboards or something that you just will spend unlimited amount of time shopping for. But most stuff&#8217;s not like that. Shopping really sucks. It&#8217;s such a waste of time and it&#8217;s stressful and why even bother with stuff that you&#8217;re not that excited about?

I love my work so much. I&#8217;m satisfied in that regard. But, I would say that, it&#8217;s also at the end of the day, we are not our jobs. I have so many things I love to do. I just wish there were 48 hours in a day. Right now, I&#8217;d say work takes up 80% of my energy, maybe 90%. I think that&#8217;s normal in most people, especially San Francisco friends who work very hard. But that&#8217;s not really how it is in Hawaii for a lot of my friends.</span></p>\n<p><b>You mentioned that in Hawaii, you are not a minority anymore and that is something that you appreciate. I&#8217;m curious to know if you experienced isolation or otherness in Silicon Valley?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think in San Francisco and in tech, I think like being an Asian male is probably the same as being a white male. There is not a ceiling there, or it’s a reduced ceiling. Maybe it&#8217;s not on the executive level where you still don&#8217;t have a lot of diversity. But San Francisco&#8217;s not bad. I think socially, I think in dating there&#8217;s discrimination. The data scientist from OK Cupid wrote a book and paraphrasing his findings, he said, “people are really racist when it comes to dating.&#8221; The feeling of discrimination is not as strong for me in places where I am not a minority, like in Hong Kong or Hawaii.</span></p>\n<p><b>Do you have any advice for folks hoping to make it in the big world of tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think you have to take some things really seriously, and then some things not seriously, and you just have to have the wisdom to know the difference. There&#8217;s knowing how to work with others, but not following people blindly. There&#8217;s a lot of seemingly contradictory advice that isn’t really contradictory if you understand the nuance. Anyone who&#8217;s really doing well, in any field, has a bunch of similar traits and mindset. They have these seemingly contradictory things in balance where they do know how to work in a group, but they also are not beholden to groupthink.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I realized about my friends in San Francisco and LA is that people in California are so much more brave, optimistic, willing to just go for it, than my friends in either Hawaii or New York. I really appreciate that about California, and San Francisco in particular. Everyone is just trying to do pretty big things, if not huge things. That energy is contagious. It&#8217;s beautiful to have this example of a peer group that is not afraid to go for it.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think you have to take some things really seriously, and then some things not seriously, and you just have to have the wisdom to know the difference.&#8221;</p></blockquote>",

I am the oldest of three kids, and the oldest cousin of nine. Had I gone to college, I would have been the first person in my family to have done so. As I dropped out (for reasons which I’m sure we’ll cover later), I think my sister claimed that title some years later.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We moved to central New Jersey, in between New Brunswick and Princeton, when I was eight. That&#8217;s where I grew up. I have had a computer since I was four, so typing is easily one of my earliest learned skills.

I got picked on a lot, and so I kinda went out of my way to avoid unnecessary social interactions where I might be alone, like lunchtime. I would eat my lunch quickly, and then escape to the library where, one day in my freshman year, I found a Mac SE, sat down, and started playing with it. It was my first exposure to a real personal computer—until then, everything had been glorified video game systems with BASIC programming interfaces (like C-64 or TI-99/4a)! It just worked for me. By the end of my freshman year, I was teaching the art teachers how to use the scanner and brand new system I had set up for them!</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I did not have very many friends as a kid.

Yanno, growing up, everyone told me I was smart. But I made a very stupid decision about college. I ended up going to Purdue University, in Indiana. Of the schools that accepted me, it was the best option, at least from a recognizable name perspective. But it was a terrible choice if I wanted to finally come out as gay in college. My roommates, and even the resident advisor for our dorm, were all exceptionally straight small-town Indiana boys. I recall learning three important things during our brief interactions: 1) abortion should not be even a word, let alone an allowable action, 2) women are essentially property of their mans, and 3) being queer should be illegal, but, since it is not, it should be taken into the hands of (let’s kindly refer to them as) vigilantes.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I ended up going to Purdue University, in Indiana.

It definitely encouraged my continued avoidance of social situations that I couldn’t control, which, ironically, continued to have the effect of exposing me to new technologies. In order to avoid my roommates, I spent all of my free time in the computer labs where I got to play with UNIX in the forms of early BSD and very early Linux, and where I was introduced some very early forms of online chat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I should back up here, because, at that point in my life, I imagined myself in a creative role. Given that so much of my exposure to systems in high school related in some way to art, I was targeting creative and graphic design as my career. My first job, in between high school and college, was running the desktop publishing department at my local Kinko’s (where I networked all the self-serve computers “just for the fun of it”). So, Purdue would have been amazing if I had my sights set on CS. But, yanno.. I’m a little slow on the uptake for some things. [laughter] So, at the time, all I consciously took from it was a way to access this world of online chat that I had been shown.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, so I dropped out. I went back home, and looked for temp work—because what the hell else was I going to do? I had that experience in desktop publishing at Kinko’s, so I went in search of some entry level design jobs. I figured I could typeset ads or something. It was during an interactive interview for one such job that things changed for me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Picture it: New York City, 1996. A young peasant boy is seated at a computer taking a timed QuarkXPress typesetting test. Suddenly, the computer? It crashes! Oh no, what will the boy do?! He takes it all in stride, that’s what he does! He fixes the damn computer, and finishes the test, JUST IN TIME! Returning to the test administrators, he tells them of his troubles with the test taking apparatus, and how he remedied them—just in case it happens again! Intrigued, the administrators escort him to another desk, holding another computer, which displays a different test: a technical skills test! “Would you mind?” they ask him. The boy complies. He flies through the test at record speed. When he returns to the administrators, at first, they are crestfallen: he’s back too fast, he must be bailing on the test, buh buh buh&#8230; but then they check the results, and their expressions noticeably change. “That’s the best score we’ve ever seen anyone get on this test. Have you ever considered a job in desktop support?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, they didn’t have one to offer me. But, it planted the right seed. And, by virtue of the connections I had made via IRC—the early form of online chat I previously mentioned—I ended up with a job doing desktop support for American Express.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I jumped around through a number of different jobs in New York City, ultimately landing at an ad agency where, at 22 years old, I held the very fancy sounding role “Manager of IT Services”—which really meant that I was the only person in the company who knew anything at all about tech. They were an all Mac shop, but it was mine to run as I wanted, so I used the available hardware to teach myself Linux. The first time I installed Linux myself was LinuxPPC, installed onto a Jaz cartridge connected to a Powerbook 5300. There’s some serious geek cred in that, I’m just sayin&#8217;.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once I had taught myself Linux, I was able to apply for actual sysadmin jobs, and so I eventually did that, and landed with the SciFi Channel’s “new media” division (remember when it was called “new media?”) as a Junior Linux System Administrator. This was really cool. It was the end of 1999, beginning of 2000, when, if you recall, the VC money was flowing like the Nile—I mean, it was just pouring out of the walls! I actually remember them telling us that we HAD to spend money, so we went out and bought an Aibo. Do you remember the Aibo?</span></p>\n<p><b>Nope.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was this robot dog that Sony made.</span></p>\n<p><b>Wait I do remember!</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yea. It was $3,000, okay? At a time when my rent was $600. At a time when a NICE apartment on the Upper West Side would have been like $2,000. We had an Aibo. Because we had to spend our money. It was fucking insane.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It was the end of 1999, beginning of 2000, when, if you recall, the VC money was flowing like the Nile—I mean, it was just pouring out of the walls!

And I had been circulating my resume, and it ended up with this company in San Mateo. Here I am—it was 2000, so I was about to turn 25—I&#8217;m 24 years old, I&#8217;m talking to a company in California. I&#8217;m a grunt. I&#8217;m a peon. I figure these people are never going to hire me, anyway. And even if they do, I can’t afford to move myself to no California! So I just treated the interviews super super casual. And, after a few rounds on the phone, they were like, &#8220;Yea, so do you want to come out and meet us?&#8221; Do I want you to pay for me to fly to San Francisco and put me in a hotel for the weekend? Um, fuck yea I want that! I figure that’s all I’m ever gonna GET out of it, so YES I definitely want that! [laughter]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I fly out, they tour me through the office, tell me all about their stuff, this and that. And then, real casual like, the director of engineering says to me, “So, what do you think? You want a job?” I mean, yea, I want a job, but I mean, I live in New Jersey. “Yea yea yea, we’ll get you here. Don’t worry about that. Do you want to work here?” I mean, yea. Yea, I guess. Yea. “Ok, great! How much do you want?” Wait, what? What are you talking about? Aren’t you supposed to tell me how much I’m getting? What do you mean how much do I want? Am I on camera? C’mon, this isn’t funny.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And so that’s how I come to live in California.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The week I arrived, the guy who hired me—the guy who I KNOW was my advocate to get me in there—got fired. He was replaced by a VP of Engineering and Operations who brought only political in-fighting to the organization. Basically all progress was stalled for five months. It got so bad, that the board had to intervene. The CEO was forced to resign. And the VP, and almost everyone within the organizations below the VP, was laid off. They kept their administrative, sales, and marketing departments, the CTO, the head DBA, and one engineer. Everybody else, it was: “See you later.” I’ve just moved to California six months ago. It’s March, 2001. I have six more months on a $1,600/month lease.</span></p>\n<p><b>Uh oh.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Holy shit [laughter]. On the upside, at least I don’t have to pay back the relocation costs! [laughter] And, again, I think I knew this VP was screwing things up, and so, again, I already had the resume out. I was really lucky: I got a job within two days. I didn&#8217;t have to leave. And, yanno, that was a really intense time. It took my peers who were laid off at the same time over a year to find another gig. Some of them DID have to go back to whatever was home for them. And these were people with more demonstrable experience than I had. So, yea, I count myself really lucky.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then that company then failed again about a year later. So now I was really stuck. I was kinda dating (but mostly just living with) a guy at the time whose parents are, basically, rich. His dad was something like the sixth employee, and the primary hardware engineer, for some networking company in the south bay. And they were sending him, literally, $2,000 a month to go to school and live in San Francisco. I can’t even conceive of somebody giving me $2,000 every month, just to exist, but here we were. So that money paid our rent, and I got some contract work through friends to bring in money for food, and I enrolled in City College of San Francisco so that I could get financial aid to cover the rest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, at the time, we had a friend who was in the hospital battling leukemia, an eighteen year old kid. Since I was out of formal work, I got to spend—on reflection not nearly enough—time with him. It was while visiting with him one day that I got the idea maybe I should be a nurse. I thought it would be a really great way to use my empathy to help people in a really vulnerable time and blah, blah, blah.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think in some ways that would have been a right path for me. But since I&#8217;ve been back in tech, when I look at some of the careless errors that I make, I go, &#8220;Oh, nooooooo.” Yanno, nobody dies if I fuck up in tech. [laughter] But, if I give the wrong person the wrong injection, they&#8217;re gonna die. So on reflection, nursing seemed a little scary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe nursing wasn&#8217;t the right choice, but aiming for it kept me in San Francisco. I didn&#8217;t have to go back to New Jersey, and that was really important. For 2002 to 2005, I battled with the CCSF student population for the precious little available space in required classes. Since I never did college after high school, I had to start from, yanno, start. So I was doing English and Psychology and all that crap. Through that whole time, my former manager had been on my ass to come back and work with him again. It took him like 16 months, but as soon as he landed, he was like, &#8220;I need you, I need you, I need you,&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You want me full-time, I can&#8217;t give you full-time, I&#8217;m going to school!&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then I got to the point where I was like, &#8220;Okay, I can apply to nursing school now,” and I knew that I had at least a semester of lag between applying and when I would begin (assuming best case scenario that I was accepted on my first try, which was almost inconceivable). I also knew that the clinical part of my education was going to be more time demanding than the classroom portion had been for these last several years. I knew that meant that I would soon lose that extra money I had been making with my contract work. Oh, and that boyfriend with the rich parents? Yea, we broke up about eight months into me being at school. So I had been really struggling to hold shit together for a while there. And so, I knew I was gonna need at least a cushion. So I gave in, and went back to work. I figured: I’ve been living on almost nothing, and he’s talking about six figures. I should have no trouble banking cash! I’ll just sink everything I can into savings, and in a couple years I’ll have a whole bunch of money, and I’ll go to nursing school!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was 2006. What&#8230; what year is this?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And here we are. I never went to nursing school. [chuckles] But I have had a lot of fun in the interim! So that&#8217;s from the beginning—that&#8217;s to now.</span></p>\n<p><b>Once you committed to a life of tech, what have been the highlights and the things that have been the most exciting to you? What are the things that make you so pumped about your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having somebody move me across the country was really fucking pumping. [chuckles] That kind of stuff has been exciting. I got to move out to Vegas and manage a data center installation there. That was really wonderful for me because it was a lot of things that I loved: I got to work from home, I got to live in the desert, and I got to manage this data center installation. I really love the anal retentiveness of managing a data center, and just keeping it really immaculate. That was a lot of fun for me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the last couple of years, tho, I’ve got to admit, I&#8217;ve really lost my excitement on tech.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I&#8217;ve kind of been getting to the point of—this is 22 years in, now—I&#8217;m starting to go what the fuck do I do next? Like, I have no other marketable skills. What do I do?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And it&#8217;s also getting a lot harder. In 1999, when I first started really learning Linux, it felt entirely within reason to think that I would get to a point where I understood it all, and that it would be good. I still feel like, back then, that was possible, and I know I’m not alone on that, because I’ve had this conversation with one of my current coworkers. But </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">there’s just been so much advancement in the last fifteen years, the last ten years, the last five years, the last two years, that there’s just too much so keep up with, and I don’t know how to do it anymore.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I read a blog post this week about how they’re changing something about the way that you define functions in python, and my immediate response was aggravation. One more fucking thing that I need to remember. God damnit!</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the last couple of years, tho, I’ve got to admit, I&#8217;ve really lost my excitement on tech.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I&#8217;ve kind of been getting to the point of—this is 22 years in, now—I&#8217;m starting to go what the fuck do I do next?

It was that this landed in my lap, and it&#8217;s a fucking great salary for somebody with only a high school degree. I mean, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m doing it. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the answer that you&#8217;re looking for. [laughter] I think about this sometimes: the only other skill that I know that I have is cooking and baking. Food. Well, that or drugs, but really only one of those is sustainable! [laughter] And food is really hard to succeed in! So I really don&#8217;t know what I would be doing if I didn&#8217;t have tech. I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;d be doing with myself.</span></p>\n<p><b>Honestly, this might sound weird to you, but it sounds a little bit different and refreshing to me, to finally meet someone willing to admit that it is work to them. It is a job. Because we live in a place where everybody puts on a face of, &#8220;I&#8217;m doing what I love, and I&#8217;m so lucky to like work on my ultimate passion.&#8221; And it&#8217;s not 100%  true for everyone. It is work, and I think it makes people who don&#8217;t totally know what their passions are, or they don&#8217;t totally know what the thing they&#8217;re destined to do, feel bad about themselves. I think this is a town where people love that myth of, &#8220;I just had a passion for this, and I&#8217;m so lucky to be doing exactly the thing that I&#8217;m so passionate about with this app that does this thing.&#8221; I feel like it&#8217;s a bit of a myth, but everybody feels pressured to—</b></p>\n<p>To maintain the bullshit. Yeah. Because, I think, it&#8217;s like, if we break that down, then we have to reevaluate everything. Then it becomes: how much else are we lying to ourselves about? [laughs] Ya know, in order to keep doing this, in order to keep spending $3,000, $4,000 every month on just our rent, to keep being away from our families, accepting that we can&#8217;t afford to travel or go on the vacations that we want to go on, because we’re spending all of this money just to be here. I get it. I totally understand why people have to maintain the myth that everything&#8217;s perfect.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;In order to keep doing this, in order to keep spending $3,000, $4,000 every month on just our rent, to keep being away from our families, accepting that we can&#8217;t afford to travel or go on the vacations that we want to go on, because we’re spending all of this money just to be here. I get it. I totally understand why people have to maintain the myth that everything&#8217;s perfect.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Yeah. It is a thing that you can still do a really good job at, even if it&#8217;s not your ultimate passion. You can still be smart and proficient and do good work, even if it&#8217;s not your dream product, which I think people also worry about here. They have to be working on the perfect product or the exact company that they&#8217;ve always been dreaming of, and anything else is a failure. You know?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wonder if that&#8217;s kind of a byproduct of what a youthful group it is that&#8217;s going into these organizations now. Ya know? Like I wonder how much of that passion is fueled by youth. Take where I am now. This is the first time in my career that I&#8217;ve looked around and gone, &#8220;Oh. I&#8217;m the old guy in the room.&#8221; Among my immediate group of about 25, I beat everyone but the director by easily more than a decade, and even the director only has me beat by less than a year. And these guys are passionate about tech. And it&#8217;s a little reminiscent of how it used to be when I was younger. I definitely remember being really excited to do the work. It definitely was fun for me, I think because it was easy, and I think because I knew it so well. It was just like, &#8220;Okay, yeah, we can do that. Here you go.&#8221; It was easy. It feels like it has that same level of ease for these younger kids, and now it&#8217;s kind of hard, and so it&#8217;s lost a lot of the fun, for me. Now it really is a means to an end. That&#8217;s over the last couple of year that&#8217;s happened.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is the first time in my career that I&#8217;ve looked around and gone, &#8220;Oh.

Now it really is a means to an end.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>What else have been struggles for you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feeling like the only queer in the organization has definitely been hard. It wasn&#8217;t until 2008 that I was on a team with somebody else who was queer. That was like 11 years into my career?</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There had been other queers in the companies &#8211; in sales, in creative, etc &#8211; but none in tech. And, I wasn’t working nowhere &#8211; this was New York City and San Francisco.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At one point, I actually ended up—how should I say this—separating from an employer after completely losing my mind about their insensitive treatment of queer issues. They had run a Red Cross blood drive, and it wasn&#8217;t getting much attention. So the director of HR came around and tried to drum up participation. When she asked me, I was like, &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll do it, whatever.&#8221; I had been smoking a lot of weed at that point, so I messaged to a friend I was like, &#8220;Ha ha ha. Somebody&#8217;s going to get my weed laced blood! Lucky them!! Ha ha!&#8221; And he&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Dude, you can&#8217;t donate blood, what are you talking about?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What am I talking about? What are you talking about I can&#8217;t donate blood? Of course I can donate blood!&#8221; They&#8217;re like, &#8220;No, you&#8217;re gay.&#8221; And so I’m all, “Wait, that shit’s still real? What fucking year is this?!&#8221;</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Feeling like the only queer in the organization has definitely been hard. It wasn&#8217;t until 2008 that I was on a team with somebody else who was queer. That was like 11 years into my career?&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, I went and researched, and, yea, okay it is still real, apparently it’s still 1985. So, I went back to the director of HR, and said—seriously, just like this, because I thought it was fucking hilarious—&#8221;Hey, listen, it turns out, because I am a man who has had sex with a man at least once since 1979, they will politely accept my blood donation and then throw it in the trash. I think that&#8217;s wasteful, and so I&#8217;m not going to do it.&#8221; She goes, &#8220;Okay,&#8221; and crosses my name off the list.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, they do the event. I was away the day that they did it, but they sent out an e-mail afterwards, and the email was the first thing that I saw when I opened my laptop on my first day back after a really intense, very emotional weekend. I’m not making excuses, just trying to set the scene a little bit maybe. Anyway, here&#8217;s this e-mail, and it&#8217;s describing the very successful blood drive, and how they got this many units of blood and other than one person who had to be excluded due to recent travel restrictions, it was a resoundingly successful event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went non-fucking-linear.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I typed up this huge email, breaking down bit by bit why it was nonsense that gay men would be excluded from donating. That this is in violation of our company values which state that all employees must be included in all things.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I then went on to be very, very, VERY colorful in the illustration of how that made me feel. It was the excessively colorful last paragraph that pushed me over the edge, but I think it came out of a lot of feeling completely fucking alone in this company. Because I evidently needed to be completely galled, the HR person, on my way out, had the audacity to give me, &#8220;C’mon, Rob, he COO is gay!&#8221; Well you know what? Where the fuck was that information when I asked for it!? When I asked my manager, and his manager, and his manager: Where are the other queers in this company, so that I don&#8217;t feel so fucking alone? Why did nobody have anything to say?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, that&#8217;s probably been the hardest thing about the work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had moved away from home when I was 17, so I wasn&#8217;t living at home before I moved to San Francisco anyway, so that wasn&#8217;t specifically hard for me. I have a brother who was just under a year old when I moved away, and having limited time to spend with him kinda sucked, but our relationship was pretty strong anyway.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The being alone part was hard, but that had nothing to do with tech, that was just me. The, &#8220;I&#8217;ve moved all the way across the country to this place that&#8217;s supposed to be Mecca for me, both in ways of queer and in ways of tech..&#8221; part.. that was rough, since I discovered pretty quickly within those first two years that it was neither. [laughter] I was able to be laid off and not find more work, and it was no more gay from my understanding than New York City was. I guess that&#8217;s probably been the hardest. But, again, not specifically related to tech.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, it seems like it&#8217;s kind of an extreme version of just not knowing anyone like you and how isolating that must be, and how that must affect your morale over time. Were you able to find support networks anywhere during that time?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. In the early 2000s, there was still a lot of really good underground-y online stuff, like the online chat stuff. That was somehow more nurturing, or more of a bonded experience, than chat is today. It&#8217;s so disposable today. There were definitely groups that I got to be a part of that I hold on to some legacy from that. Most of my current friends descend directly, in one way or another, from those early chat experiences.</span></p>\n<p><b>How how do you feel about the current state of tech bubble or boom or however you want to look at it versus the last one?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have been growing increasingly concerned. It definitely does seem like we&#8217;re at a point of being back to crazy times, like: how can these organizations be worth billions with a B? No, I don&#8217;t buy it. Even if what you&#8217;re buying is the talent in the company that built the product to add it to your portfolio, I don&#8217;t buy that it&#8217;s a billion dollars. Plus people quit. I just don&#8217;t get it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t think about it too consciously, but probably unconsciously, it’s probably fueling a lot of my discomfort about the state of things for myself. I have been in the position before where I&#8217;ve had to compete with people I know were a lot smarter than me for work! And now I&#8217;d be competing in a much different way. Because I am even less attractive now that I&#8217;m 40 years old, right? Now I&#8217;m not this young kid that you can abuse and make do whatever the fuck you want to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I am a little bit concerned. I didn’t know to plan for it back then, but I’m working on it for this time. But, in any case, I think, just like back then, I&#8217;m just going to keep riding it until I can&#8217;t anymore. Hopefully, I’ll figure out a good plan B before then.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I have been in the position before where I&#8217;ve had to compete with people I know were a lot smarter than me for work! And now I&#8217;d be competing in a much different way. Because I am even less attractive now that I&#8217;m 40 years old, right? Now I&#8217;m not this young kid that you can abuse and make do whatever the fuck you want to.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>What would ideally you like to see change in tech, culturally or technologically or economically or whatever?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would like to see it spread. I would like to see this type of an environment exist in places that are not just San Francisco. And I don&#8217;t quite get why that hasn&#8217;t migrated yet.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself five or ten years from now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Such an interesting question. In the past, the answer to that question has always been, “exactly where I am now, just making more money?” answered just like that: as a question. [laughter] Let’s see, ten years from now, I&#8217;m going to be 50. I really don&#8217;t know that I have the capacity for any more advancement within tech. I don&#8217;t know that I want to go the route of architect. And I&#8217;m pretty confident I don&#8217;t want to go manager. I think it should be evident, from your interactions with me, that that would be a terrible terrible idea. [chuckles]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, I don’t know. I see a couple possibilities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one scenario, I’m still working in tech, either for my current employer or another, but I’m living somewhere in UTC+8±2, so somewhere between New Zealand and Burma, and working 100% remotely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In another scenario, I’m living in UTC+8±2, but giving scuba diving lessons to western tourists.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And in still a third, and I think more realistic, scenario, I’m still in California, working in the medical cannabis industry in some capacity. I’ve been fighting this impulse for the last several years, but every single time I really try to come up with something that I can actually feel passionate about, this is all I come back to. My current partner surprised me recently by proposing the idea, “What if we opened a dispensary together?” so we’ve started exploring that possibility.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I don’t know.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ten years from now, I&#8217;m going to be 50. I really don&#8217;t know that I have the capacity for any more advancement within tech.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>How are you supposed to know?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wish I knew. I&#8217;ve never known. I&#8217;ve always just kind of been doing it. I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ll take it as it comes. In a perfect world, if I could actually script it, I&#8217;d be doing some sort of queer rights activism. My current partner &#8211; he&#8217;s actually a student at City College right now &#8211; came home one day, and he goes, &#8220;Hey. What would you think,” he’s ethnically Cambodian, “if I wanted to move to Cambodia and do queer rights activism there?&#8221; It&#8217;s a country that&#8217;s kinda ripe for it. I thought, “That would be fucking amazing! It would be incredible to be part of that movement! Oh my god!” So, who knows? Maybe I&#8217;ll be doing that. If I could do that and fund it with—like I said—a job that I&#8217;m still getting San Francisco money from—and just not losing all of it—yanno, that would be fantastic.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah [laughter].</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know.</span></p>\n<p><b>My last question for you is what advice would you have for someone just getting started out in tech and perhaps feeling isolated?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s a hard question, because I still don&#8217;t know. I mean, if I didn&#8217;t have the employee resource group where I am, I would again be in a place where most everyone immediately around me is very straight. One of our DBAs, she&#8217;s not specifically a lesbian, because she’s married, but she was right on top of me. So I would&#8217;ve had that, but I don&#8217;t know if I didn’t have her or the employee group. I wish I knew [laughs]. I guess it would just be keep waiting and eventually it happens. There&#8217;s groups. There&#8217;s these meet ups, but they&#8217;ve never felt right to me. Even our employee group has done one or two, like, social mixers with the queer groups from some other local tech companies. And I&#8217;ve gone to them, but it’s just like a bar. So, I guess, in a way, I still feel alone. I&#8217;m working with more queers, but I still feel alone. I&#8217;m not working with queer engineers, so I still struggle with trying to answer that question, I guess.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I guess, in a way, I still feel alone.

Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am a Bay Area native. I was born and raised in San Francisco and Daly City. Then I moved to a suburb, and then moved back. Actually, moved to a suburb, then moved to Sacramento, which was terrible, and then moved directly back to San Francisco. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went to college because I thought that&#8217;s what I was supposed to do after high school. I always prioritized my social life and my friends and fun before anything else. I would do this thing where I would just go into random classes and not really be fully participating in any. I ended up going to college for seven years, and I did three or four different major tracks. I was about ten credits short for three different majors. Then they finally just came back, one of the deans were like, &#8220;You need to graduate. You need to leave.&#8221; I made a special major out of basically a theory that I would write in a paper format for a cumulation of what I had learned over the years. My actual college degree is a  communication analysis of the performativity of lesbians in mainstream media from 2001 to 2007. So, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I like to joke that I majored in the L word.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> That&#8217;s pretty much what I majored in.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I went to college because I thought that&#8217;s what I was supposed to do after high school.

You need to leave.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While majoring in the L word, I would work odd jobs to make up the gaps for my scholarships. That’s how I found my way into computers. I started out in sale at Best Buy. I moved from sales at Best Buy to sales at Geek Squad, to tinkering in Geek Squad, to independent consulting work, to working at an enterprise and fixing computers there, to provisioning computers, and then moving into Linux System administration and systems work, and then bouncing around at different areas of a start up. Which is how I’ve landed at <a href=\"https://www.twilio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Twilio</a>.</span></p>\n<p><b>When you were first entering computer land, selling computers at Best Buy, did you have any inclination that you would end up in Silicon Valley or was this more of a, &#8220;I gotta pay my bills&#8221; situation?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a little of both, actually. Initially I wanted to work in tech but I didn&#8217;t actually want to be a technical person. All of my friends and all of my background has been really focused on communication analysis. So, I really wanted to be in PR. I thought that by having a family friend that had worked at Google—and this was back in the day when, actually, having a family friend working at Google meant something—I thought that I would have an in after I graduated. Because I took so long [in school] and Google blew up the way that it did, that was no longer valid. So, when I first started working in tech it was just a way to pay the bills. Then when I worked at Sales Force it was mostly to pay the bills but also it was that really small foot in the door. Every position I applied for out of that consulting position, none of it was engineering focused. I applied for human resources, for marketing, for project managers, for an admin in their real estate department. I kept going for literally, again, anything other than technical.</span></p>\n<p><b>When was the moment that you discovered coding and was like, &#8220;Oh, this is my shit.&#8221;</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The part where it was &#8220;the shit&#8221; was probably not for a long time. I was on this rotating consulting gig. The team was me and less than 20 other people. We all hated it because we were paid nothing compared to what other people were paid. And by nothing, I mean, our consulting firm happened to be based in Dallas, Texas and so we were being paid Dallas, Texas wages. It just so happened that the people sitting next to me were a consulting firm based in San Francisco. We were doing the exact same thing and being paid vastly different amounts.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I found programming as a shortcut to doing things versus falling in love with it</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone on the Dallas team were leaving. One dude was leaving and he was the only person to support Linux machines at Sales Force at the time. He turned to me and said, &#8220;Dude, I&#8217;m leaving. I&#8217;m going to Yelp. Do you want this book?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yeah. Of course I want this book.&#8221; I ended up just filling the gap after he left. As I became the only person supporting Linux machines, I found that a lot of the same things were happening over and over again so I would just script certain things. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I found programming as a shortcut to doing things versus falling in love with it</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I didn&#8217;t fall in love with programming until I went to Twilio and started actually developing. </span></p>\n<p><b>Interesting. You used the term community-taught to describe your past engineering. Tell me more about that concept.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of people like to say self-taught, self-taught, and I feel like that&#8217;s a little too elitist for me. Community-taught comes from the authors who wrote the beginning books that I read to the online tutorials that were always free. I utilized a lot of people&#8217;s time. There&#8217;s two different camps of people I learned from:  people who wanted to teach and people who just got stuck teaching me. When I didn&#8217;t understand something, I would start off by tapping them on the shoulder. When I realized that wasn&#8217;t productive, I would actually just carve out time with them. I had to show that by taking two days just to teach me how to do something, it would in the end help me ramp up faster, and I would bother them less if they just took two days, two hours, whatever to teach me.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;A lot of people like to say self-taught, self-taught, and I feel like that&#8217;s a little too elitist for me.

I bugged them relentlessly when I was first starting. People who spent their free time learning how to create easier ways for people to grasp concepts. They did that in their free time, too. It&#8217;s not fair to say that I learned this all on my own because I didn&#8217;t.</span></p>\n<p><b>What would you say are the most exciting things, to you, about working in tech? What parts of the work really activate you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up, I really wanted to be an inventor. I knew that inventing something new was going to put me on the map. It fostered creativity. Now I get to invent things, or new ways to interact with things, every day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that where we are right now in tech, or in computer engineering, in general, is at a larger scope than we&#8217;ve ever had before. We have people and ideas that are solving problems that we never thought imaginable.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Growing up, I really wanted to be an inventor.

They would map it to a Google heat map and use an algorithm to track the progression of a disease. They were able to send resources before a disease was going to have an outbreak in a certain area—just by using an algorithm. We have all of these minds! Sometimes they&#8217;ll do something silly like create new ways to say &#8220;Yo&#8221; to each other. Other times you have people who say, &#8220;Here&#8217;s a problem that I totally think that we can solve together.” Generally, the people who really, really want to solve a problem have come at it from a place of passion versus a place of greed. It&#8217;s so amazing to see what people come up with.</span></p>\n<p><b>When did your focus turn to inclusivity in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It kind of bounced around inclusivity in tech. When I was at Sales Force and I didn&#8217;t feel like I was a part of the technical community. I thought using employee interest groups would be a way for me to network. That&#8217;s kind of how I got started with inclusivity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I moved to a smaller company, I realized that things were way different. We had started an inclusion group about eight months after joining. A colleague and I were leading that for a while. When that person left, we started to feel a lot of the impact of having a person leave or why people were starting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn&#8217;t until someone explicitly pointed it out to me that I was the only girl in the room or that I was the only gay person on the team that I moved into the diversity inclusion work. I was constantly the spokesperson for this entire identity. At the time, I didn&#8217;t think anything of it. Someone pointed it out it was like, &#8220;You know you wouldn’t have to be that if there were more people of color in your company.” And I was like, &#8220;Oh, shit. I probably wouldn&#8217;t have to be the spokesperson.&#8221;</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t until someone explicitly pointed it out to me that I was the only girl in the room or that I was the only gay person on the team that I moved into the diversity inclusion work.

I was like, &#8220;Holy shit. They exist.&#8221; They&#8217;re not just at home with their wives and cats, or girlfriends</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started to ask why don&#8217;t these groups exist? Why was it hard to get into this industry? When I ask people &#8211; whether they&#8217;re people of color, or people who identify as female, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT\" target=\"_blank\">LGBT</a> people, or someone with a disability, associating background &#8211; there are one of two camps. One: they will believe fully that they got where they are because of who they are and their skill set. And there are other people who are like, &#8220;Holy shit. I am so lucky to be here. And I worked my ass off, just like everybody else, but the system worked against me way more than it did everybody else.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m in the camp where I think that the system worked against me a lot and I wouldn&#8217;t be here if it wasn&#8217;t for opportunity. It&#8217;s not fair that I&#8217;m the only person to have gotten that opportunity. That I found some random loophole or some random person to give me a shot. I owe almost everything in my tech career to two people. Two people who I interviewed for a position that I definitely was not good for. I left that thinking, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why I went to this interview.&#8221; They gave me a shot. They did this thing where they assessed what I knew and what I knew and how long it would take me to get up to speed. That’s something I&#8217;ve never forgotten and something that I want to give as an opportunity to everyone else.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t until I  joined Lesbians Who Tech that I realized that I could have a positive lesbian role model in my life.

What have been some of your biggest struggles that you&#8217;ve had to overcome during your time in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have consistent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">impostor syndrome</a>. I had an interview a couple of weeks ago where they asked me a question and I felt like the answer was way too easy. So, I didn&#8217;t say it. And I was just like, &#8220;No. There&#8217;s no way that the answer is this.&#8221; It was, literally, one of those things where it was like, &#8220;Tell me one of these things is not like the other.&#8221; And it was the equivalent of all of them being blue except for red. I thought, &#8220;Nope. That&#8217;s not it. They&#8217;re tricking me.&#8221; I refused to believe that I knew the answer that quickly. I ended up second guessing myself the entire interview. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am absolutely a workaholic and this industry has definitely helped that. It&#8217;s not uncommon to get an email at two in the morning. It&#8217;s not uncommon to see people in the office 9:00 at night. It&#8217;s generally because we like what we do. It&#8217;s not a case of having meals catered and transportation taken care of and lack of dependencies on being home at a certain time. It’s the fact that you love what you&#8217;re doing and you believe in what you&#8217;re doing. It&#8217;s so easy to just lose track of time. Especially if your days are filled with in-person meetings or interviews. By the time six o’clock rolls around, you can finally start doing your work.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve focused a lot on inclusivity in tech and making sure that the way that I interview a Harvard or Stanford or MIT grad is not going to be the way I interview somebody who is a person of color.

It’s compounded by having two kinds of people that you prove yourself to: the ones who have no idea they&#8217;re undercutting you and the ones who know that they&#8217;re undercutting you, and they expect you to prove something. It makes you work harder, which makes you work later. Before you know it, you&#8217;re only sleeping two-three hours a night.</span></p>\n<p><b>What is it like being part of both the tech community and the queer community? I&#8217;m curious to know from your experience what it&#8217;s like being queer in tech and being a techie in the queer community here?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being queer and tech is one thing. Being queer in tech, especially being a female identified queer person in tech is almost invisible. I say that because when you work in a male dominated team, especially a millennial male dominated team, a lot of people will always think, &#8220;Oh, yeah, it&#8217;s totally cool that you&#8217;re gay. Don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221; It’s a millennial time where you&#8217;ll hear things like, &#8220;Oh, yeah, I totally dated a bi chick once.&#8221;  I don&#8217;t care about that. When I was younger and men were trying to find a common ground with me through male dominated activities. They would say things like, &#8220;Yeah, did you see the ass on her?&#8221; Or, &#8220;Would you hit that?&#8221; It&#8217;s like, &#8220;We both like women, but I like and respect them, and you don&#8217;t.&#8221; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I found that it was so much easier for someone to see me as one of the guys versus someone to see me as a queer person, especially a queer woman. That was always a struggle for me and that&#8217;s why I left a previous company. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I found that it was so much easier for someone to see me as one of the guys versus someone to see me as a queer person, especially a queer woman.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As far as being a queer person who techs, I feel like there&#8217;s a lot of pressure on me. It&#8217;s not necessarily because I&#8217;m a queer person in tech. It&#8217;s more or less that I am a queer person in tech who is also female identified, who is also a person of color, who also came from a lower socio-economic background. Those are so many groups of oppressed people who are looking at you like, &#8220;You made it. What else can we do? How can you bring us with you?&#8221; It&#8217;s like, I can&#8217;t carry four groups of oppressed people on my back right now. </span></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also those things where a diversity company or a diversity focused initiative will come to you, and just say, &#8220;You want more diverse talent, right?&#8221; It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah, I do, but I want the right talent, and I want to give equal opportunity without you forcing people that you know aren&#8217;t right for this position.&#8221;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went to a career fair recently just to recruit people, and they were like, &#8220;We&#8217;re diversity focused, diversity focused.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s great.&#8221; I would love to hire more people that are like me, or that are in groups that I feel have been oppressed, and have more obstacles than others. The candidates that were thrown at me, just at this particular conference, had never programmed a day in their life. There are a lot of great candidates who identify with these groups but are not as entry level. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People expect you to make certain changes or judgement calls because you&#8217;re a person of color and I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s fair.</span></p>\n<p><b>What is it like in your experience being both a techie and a local?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have tried very, very hard to not say this and to not blow up at this. I have felt this bubbling below the surface for a quite some time now. My family was pushed out of San Francisco. It was San Francisco before the first bubble burst back in early 2000. I remember watching my family be a little devastated that they could no longer afford the place that they had lived in for decades. Moving us up to the suburbs where my dad had to commute two and a half hours to work and my mom had to commute an hour and a half. I remember not being able to be with my family because they were always working and commuting in order to pay for our house in the suburbs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went to school. I got a great education and I worked really hard to be where I am. That’s when I moved back. I actually moved back to the same neighborhood that I grew up in. People call me &#8220;Techie Scum&#8221; and that I&#8217;m gentrifying our neighborhood when I&#8217;m really just taking back the neighborhood I was kicked out of. It really sucks. People who have been here for six years will tell me that I&#8217;m ruining the neighborhood, or that because of my company, or the industry that I&#8217;m in, that I&#8217;m the reason that they&#8217;re being evicted.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;My family was pushed out of San Francisco.

I moved back because I wanted to be home and I wanted to feel like I was safe again. My grandmother actually lived and has lived for a number of years, one block away from where I live or where I work now. When I was growing up, I was told never to leave my grandmother&#8217;s house and go anywhere, except for going straight to <a href=\"https://www.bart.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">BART</a>. Now the rent is more than she&#8217;s ever made in a year, probably. It&#8217;s so infuriating to see people who actually just fit that mold of what everybody hates, and then to be put in that same bubble. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything that I could actually do to make my voice heard in that. </span></p>\n<p>There are people who complained about the homeless population in San Francisco, or the people who like to capitalize on buses, or who like to celebrate sports wins in a violent way towards the city. You know when I was growing up, they were giving out Giants tickets on the streets, begging people to go to those games before it was relevant. While I was growing up, 49ers game was something that we don&#8217;t even go to because it wasn&#8217;t in a safe neighborhood. And now, people are basically just reclaiming it, and claiming that they&#8217;re natives after six years. It&#8217;s just infuriating, really. I love San Francisco. I grew up here. It&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s changed a lot. But the hostility from six-year locals is almost enough to just not want to be here anymore.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I love San Francisco. I grew up here.

They were there from first kiss to me coming out to somebody&#8217;s first marriage and divorce and first kids and everything. My support network are the people who I know I&#8217;ve been vulnerable with. People I know who would never judge me for that. Sometimes I know that there are friendships where people feel like they&#8217;re depleted because the friendship seems one-sided but these friendships that I have, they&#8217;re people I could not talk to for six years and come back and just say, &#8220;I need you right now.&#8221; And they&#8217;re fantastic people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My technical support networks have been the people who have mentored me and I can, in turn, return that favor.

That&#8217;s going to either say that they were not set up to succeed or that no one is checking in and seeing what the progression of somebody&#8217;s career is.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m really focused on what they look like when they work remotely. I have very bad ADHD and a little manic so if they have an open floor plan I can&#8217;t work productively. I have to spend one to two days just working at home or in a quiet room. If this company doesn&#8217;t know how to work remotely then I can&#8217;t be a part of this company in the way that is set up to succeed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I like to look at where their focus is, as far as how they give back to the community. I like to look at whether they have a dot org and if I can tell that their dot org or non profit branch seems like it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s a great tax benefit or because the people actually believe in that mission. I like to look at their onboarding process; if they just throw me in the deep end and I&#8217;m on call the next day, that&#8217;s really shitty, but if they look like they have a 90 day plan to have people succeed that&#8217;s fantastic. I look at the things I love from my previous positions and hope that the next company can do better or is open to doing better.</span></p>\n<p><b>When I worked in tech a primary feeling I had was that of isolation—I mean, there were chicks in tech at that time but it was more socioeconomic for me. I&#8217;m curious to know how your socioeconomic background contributes to the way that you feel in the industry. I&#8217;m curious if you can relate.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. Actually, a lot. That&#8217;s just something that I don&#8217;t think we talk about enough in the industry. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We talk about diversity and we always talk about the visible things. As someone from a lower socioeconomic background, it is amazing the difference in ways that people see things.</span><i> </i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, the first thing is you&#8217;re surrounded by people who make so much money and spend it like it&#8217;s nothing. The people that you sit with every day may not have the mounds of student loan debt that you do. Or if you are helping your family out, they don&#8217;t have to help their family out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I recently heard a story where there were two people in a sales division at another company and, basically, they were both caught fluffing numbers, essentially. And one of them was a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisgender\" target=\"_blank\">CIS</a> white man who came from an affluent, affluent family. And the other one was a Latina woman who was a single mom and she had just graduated from a state school. And the Latina woman was like, &#8220;No. I didn&#8217;t do it. I didn&#8217;t do it.&#8221; And the company came back and it&#8217;s just like, &#8220;If you just tell us you&#8217;ll be fine. Just tell us that you did it.&#8221; She like, &#8220;No. I didn&#8217;t do it.&#8221; They tell the same thing to the guy and the guy&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah. I did it. My bad. I didn&#8217;t know.&#8221; And they ended up firing the Latina woman for lying. And somebody comes back and was like, &#8220;Do you know what you just did?&#8221; She lied because that was her only source of income and you just cut it. You rewarded an affluent person because he told the truth knowing that if he lost his job he would have his trust fund to fall back on. He would have these resources to fall back on.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We talk about diversity and we always talk about the visible things.

That’s when you can really tell who came from a background where bussing their own tables is foreign to them. I will definitely see somebody cleaning off their own table or cleaning out a workstation on their own or offering to hold the door for somebody who&#8217;s in the service committee because they recognize those faces. They recognize people like that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I remember when I got my first offer. I was so excited. My first offer was more than both my parents made combined. I was so excited for a whole month. I remember texting my partner, &#8220;I have enough for all of my bills and I can eat this week and I still have more money to put into savings than I know what to do with.&#8221; It was amazing and then someone was like, &#8220;Oh, cool. I&#8217;m so happy for you. What did you make?&#8221; I was feeling really good and I told them. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;You know that your offer was thirty thousand less than what you&#8217;re supposed to be making, right?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Ugh. I&#8217;m an idiot. I feel like shit,&#8221; and it was also because I never learned to negotiate. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People who come from a lower socioeconomic background learn to be happy with what they have got.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I remember when I got my first offer.

That&#8217;s how I could afford rent and that&#8217;s how I could afford ramen &#8211; and ramen back then was ramen. Ramen was not $11 a bowl. It was like, &#8220;Hey. I spent $3 and I got six weeks of food.&#8221; There&#8217;s so many different aspects. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You hang on to the things that you are so afraid to lose because you know that as much as you save, you could lose this job. And this job can be the only opportunity for you crawl out of a hole of debt that you&#8217;ve been told to invest in. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amount of times that you hit up for get rich quick schemes, for borrowing money, and everybody who&#8217;s asking to borrow money from you is your family, your homies, your best friends. You all grew up the same way and you can&#8217;t say no because you know where they&#8217;re coming from and you feel guilty for all the money that you make.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I think being in tech from a low socioeconomic background is more guilt than it is ever pleasure.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do your friends and family from home feel about how far you&#8217;ve come?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of them make fun of me. Not that I&#8217;m the one that made it or anything like that.They&#8217;re just like, &#8220;Dude. You were the class clown and you never took anything seriously.&#8221; And they&#8217;re seeing me being featured on random articles or something or being mentioned in certain things. And they&#8217;re just like, &#8220;Who are you right now? When did you grow up and become and adult?&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think a part of that is because when you grow up in a different socioeconomic background it&#8217;s so much easier to get caught in those loops. I still know people who are at Best Buy and who it&#8217;s easier for them to climb up that corporate ladder than to take a risk and leap somewhere else. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My dad keeps giving me all these random rules to live by so that I won&#8217;t lose my job. His rules are so outdated where it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you ever check e-mail from your work computer.&#8221; It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Wait. What?&#8221; I think we got into an argument today because I sent him a Google link from my work computer and he was so afraid that I was going to get fired over it. I think that fear rules because people—whether they&#8217;re people of color, or from a different socioeconomic background, or people who&#8217;ve ever just been fired before —are in a constant level of fear to never let anybody they ever know, make the same mistakes that they did. It&#8217;s one thing to get fired if you have a safety net, but if you come from a lower economic background getting fired is not an option.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one thing to get fired if you have a safety net, but if you come from a lower economic background getting fired is not an option.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>We&#8217;ve definitely touched on this, but how do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? What is really exciting to you? What frustrates you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exciting, again, is that something is going to come out, that I&#8217;ve never even thought of. Whether that&#8217;s a good thing or a bad thing, I don&#8217;t know. We have all these really, really great minds that are learning to exercise a muscle in ways that they&#8217;ve never knew was possible. This big focus on pushing towards diversity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My biggest fear is that it becomes noise, versus action. I really hope that the right people get involved, not just these companies that want to solve the problem, and not just recruiting in HR, that&#8217;s like, &#8220;No, we should totally hire more people of color, and women,&#8221; but people who are in a position to hire, or in a position to move a product forward, I hope that they will look back and say, &#8220;You know what? I can skip this product cycle, and we can really invest in our team, here.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m afraid that the bubble is going to burst, and what that means for the bubble to burst, especially for the people who came out of nothing, and worked their entire asses off, just to get to the brink of it can have it burst on them. People who are entitled to get a dose of reality, if that does happen. The stereotype is just like there&#8217;s no wrangling it. There are so many emotions out there like I don&#8217;t know what to feel because it&#8217;s too much effort to try to wrangle  those emotions because it&#8217;s mainly fear.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. What advice would you give to folks from similar backgrounds to you who are getting a start in tech or are hoping to get into it? What do you wish you&#8217;d known in the beginning?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wish I knew that I belonged here and I didn&#8217;t have to continue to try and prove myself everyday.

I wish that I knew not to be so afraid of losing what I have in working here, and that a risk is worth taking. That it&#8217;s really, really, really hard to take when you know what you can lose. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so hard for people who come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to start their own company. Probably people from affluent backgrounds just sitting there and judging you and the statistics the way that they are, probably people who were male, white, CIS just sitting there and judging you as I was like a person of color just asking for money. Those are the biggest things that I wish that I knew.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I wish I knew that I belonged here and I didn&#8217;t have to continue to try and prove myself everyday.

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Hi. Hello. Okay. Before we start, are there any particular topics that you want to go deep into for this interview?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m pretty interested in cognitive diversity, not just racial or any particular backgrounds, but rather being able to think outside of a very homogenous fashion. I’m also passionate about helping Asian Americans crack the bamboo ceiling. </span></p>\n<p><b>We&#8217;ll dig into that. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay. Sweet.</span></p>\n<p><b>Let&#8217;s start at the beginning. Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born in China, and then I came here when I was four, lived in Ann Arbor for like three years through second grade. My dad was a researcher. He came here on a world health fellowship, and stayed to do research in the hearing sciences. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We moved to Portland when I was seven, and stayed there until high school. Portland was fairly white, and homogenous in that sense, so I definitely felt like my childhood was fairly sheltered. As an only child, I was sheltered and given all the resources to succeed, which a luxury. Luckily, my tiger parents were good about giving me room to roam. I went to USC on a full ride scholarship but I just hated college. </span></p>\n<p><b>How so?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I chose USC for a purely rational reason—no debt—but it was the wrong culture for me. I think the general disconnect had to do with the overall the LA/Orange County bubble. I went for the academics, but I also expected a certain life experience and social aspect.  I did find my groove eventually, but the first two years were really hard on me. I was different and didn&#8217;t really fit in.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The path to PM was nonlinear and circuitous. My career has been very stochastic full of many detours.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At USC, I kind of boomeranged around, I started pre-med and then realized I didn&#8217;t love advanced chemistry and I actually failed a test for the first time in my life. I had a pre-med counselor who was like, &#8220;I think you should find the intersection between what you&#8217;re good at and what you enjoy.&#8221; He was like, &#8220;You have really good interpersonal skills. You should think about something related to that.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I decided to pursue a joint degree in psych and econ. I discovered an emerging area called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroeconomics\">Neuroeconomics</a>. I really enjoyed blending sciences and disciplines because I never felt like I was very good at one thing. Growing up I felt proficient in most things, but I wasn&#8217;t amazing in one thing. My true forte was blending ideas in an interdisciplinary way where I can bridge information and connect gaps. I identify as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipotentiality\">multipotentialite</a>, someone who has many creative pursuits and no one particular calling in life. </span></p>\n<p><b>So you graduated with psych and econ degrees. Walk me on the path from that to being a PM.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The path to PM was nonlinear and circuitous. My career has been very stochastic full of many detours. I graduated after the big financial crisis in 2008. After college I decided to take a year off and apply to law school. I moved back to Portland and worked for a non-profit called the ACLU, which was an eye-opening experience. Working on the ACLU really opened my eyes in terms of what I wanted in a non-profit. I wanted to go into nonprofit legal consulting and bring a little bit of for-profit efficiency to non-profits. Seeing an organization like the ACLU struggle super hard during the recession and seeing people lose morale was hard. Being in an environment where people join because they were true believers and then become disillusioned by the economics and the inefficiencies was a huge turnoff. My experience at the ACLU made me question if there was a market for nonprofit law. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After I applied to law school, I decided to travel through Asia for a couple of months. I came to SF to pick up my Chinese Visa. Around that time, my very good friend from college and her boyfriend moved here and he started working at <a href=\"https://www.sunrun.com/\">Sunrun</a>, a solar startup. One day I went to visit their office and I was really blown away by how young everyone was. At non-profits, usually you’ve been there for a while, but everyone at Sunrun was super young and fun. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once I got a taste of that environment which was very palpable—smart people having a good time—I knew I had to be part of the action. I just wanted a foot in the door.  I applied to every job opening at Sunrun. I slept on a futon for a couple weeks in Berkeley and just interviewed around.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It took me a while to even understand what product management is because everyone had their own definition. I took every PM out to lunch and coffee and just tried to understand how they got to where they are.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My first job at Sunrun was a customer service rep job. I remember jumping up and down in a restaurant bathroom when I got the call that I got the job. It paid pennies but it didn’t matter because I wanted that job so badly. Working at Sunrun wasn&#8217;t a linear path like law school or med school. I was just going to give it a year to see how it would work out. I was going to defer law school, have a great time in SF, and then go back on the linear safe path. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I worked there while it was under 100 and I was the second girl on our customer support team. I started answering phone calls from really angry customers—just being yelled at by people for a good eight hours a day was pretty character building. I started relaying a lot of their really angry complaints over to our product team, and try to categorize and bucket them into clusters of problems. That was when I realized, wow there&#8217;s this domain called product management and they&#8217;re all really smart and elite people at Sunrun. But everyone came from a certain pedigree. It was a Stanford, GSB company where mostly Stanford kids were able to do the cool stuff. It was very clear to me I was an underdog from a tier two school, and it would take a great deal to crack into product.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It took me a while to even understand what product management is because everyone had their own definition. I took every PM out to lunch and coffee and just tried to understand how they got to where they are.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> They were all skeptical, saying &#8220;You don&#8217;t have a degree in computer science, or you don&#8217;t have an MBA.&#8221; That was binary. You had to either have one or the other in order to be a PM. And I was like, &#8220;Well, if I don&#8217;t have any of these, what can I do to win over credibility?&#8221; </span></p>\n<p>So I started doing a time share with our Director of Product and convinced our HR team to  give me an opportunity where I can do 50% product and 50% customer care and that was the first time anyone had done that. I was basically doing two people&#8217;s jobs because it&#8217;s never going to be fifty-fifty perfectly. A lot was expected out of me and I was basically compared to someone who had just joined the company with four or five years of product within Solar. It was really hard because I worked hard, but I also didn&#8217;t have the right context for things, nor the experience. At the end of that trial period—it was supposed to be three months—I kind of knew I wasn&#8217;t going to get an offer. The director expected a lot out of me, rightfully so, but it still hurt because it felt like I tried my hardest but wasn&#8217;t good enough. From there, I was like, &#8220;Well, if I can&#8217;t do product at Sunrun, I can try to approximate into product.&#8221; That was when I decided to apply to <a href=\"https://opower.com/\">Opower</a> which was still going to be within the same renewable clean tech space, but I would finally work at a software company. I joined as a technical project manager. I think Opower was a really great move for me in the sense I felt like I got closer to the software and technical side. Opower was great in the sense that for the first time, I got to work with engineers, and they hired me to do a lot of implementation work, integrating their core platform with the utility clients.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entire Opower product is based off of behavioral science, which I get because that&#8217;s what I studied in college. Every product was based off this study by Robert Cialdini where he found out people will consume less power when they&#8217;re compared to other people similar to them, so it&#8217;s kind of like tapping into the whole keeping up with the Joneses complex. Yeah, I had a great time there, but ultimately I didn&#8217;t have the pedigree they wanted for product. A lot of their non-technical folks were able to go into product, but then they hired a VP of product who came from Google, and basically was like we&#8217;re switching our entire product org to be like Google. Again I was back in the position where you either you have a computer science degree or an MBA to be a PM. So I basically was like, &#8220;Fuck,&#8221; I&#8217;m in the same boat as I was before even though I&#8217;m pretty damn sure I can do the job, because all the work I was doing as a technical project manager was very much like routing feedback over to product. So from there I was like, well, if I can&#8217;t make inroads into product within this company, then I should just look externally, and that was when Sigfig reached out to me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.sigfig.com/site/#/home/am\" target=\"_blank\">SigFig</a> a financial services startup. They said they needed someone who could do partnerships, project management, and a little bit of product. So in a way I was able to leverage my strengths as a project manager, but also negotiate my way into product too. They hired to me to work on partnerships with AOL and Yahoo Finance. They promised me &#8220;After you launch these partnerships, we&#8217;ll give you an opportunity to do product.&#8221; For me that was the turning point where I had to stop trying to prove to people—like I can do product, give me a chance. Now I finally have the PM title while doing this hybridized role. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was very much enamored by the fact that I could work at a series A company and finally work as a PM. My degree of naivete really got me to take the plunge without that first assessing the company scrupulously. Do they have the right product market fit? Are they making money? And the answers were no [laughter]. So as a PM there I basically did everything from working on partnerships, to building out a new investment tool product, all the way to operations helping them manually sign up people. It was just a lot of schlepping, and I think that experience made me realize the PM role is so not glamorous. I lost a lot of hair in my first couple of months just from the sheer stress. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working at a company where you don’t know if it&#8217;s going to be alive in a year or two from now was terrifying.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I think in one day I cried four times once—once in the bathroom, once in the alley outside office, on my home, and then finally at home.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I felt like I was expected to pick up this company and put it together when everything else was collapsing around me. I tried really hard and basically lived at work before realizing it wasn’t going to work out. I think the most harrowing experience wasn’t just the fact that I was set up for failure. It was the fact that I had a friend sabotage me at work.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I never felt that degree of violation nor mistrust in anyone in my life. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think up until that point I had always thought people had your best interest at heart. I never had a mindset of protecting myself from someone who was the offender. That to me was kind of a huge pop to my ego. And my world view just really changed afterwards—not everyone has your best interest at heart in this world.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I should have seen this coming, but I didn&#8217;t realize that we would have a conflict of interest in the sense, she knew me outside of work. She was doing legal for them. She was also doing HR. She was also doing Ops and she basically knew exactly how much everyone made. And she found out that she was the person paid the least even though she had a law degree. And I noticed over time that she had a sense of bitterness building up. She started sabotaging me at work. She quoted things from Lean In and Sheryl Sandberg saying things like, &#8220;I&#8217;m just trying to help you. Women have to help each other out.&#8221; She told me “no knows what you&#8217;re doing at this company. You need to join operations full time and work under me.” She tried to manipulate the CEO into thinking that none of my work was substantial, and I started doing ops work for her because she didn’t know how to automate the customer sign-up process. I found out I was reporting to her, which was really strange. There was huge conflict of interest. Then over time she started stripping away my responsibilities and cutting me out in meetings, and basically just tried to squeeze me slowly. I realized that she was out to get to get me, when one of the other PMs there was like, &#8220;She&#8217;s not your friend anymore. You need to watch your back.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was when I started CC-ing our CEO on every email, and basically making sure that there was one source of truth, instead of her saying, &#8220;I talked to the CEO and this is what he wants you to do.&#8221; I never felt that degree of violation nor mistrust in anyone in my life. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think up until that point I had always thought people had your best interest at heart. I never had a mindset of protecting myself from someone who was the offender. That to me was kind of a huge pop to my ego. And my world view just really changed afterwards—not everyone has your best interest at heart in this world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That sense of betrayal was also just a huge loss of innocence for me. I was very bitter after I left the company in the sense it wasn&#8217;t just a job that didn&#8217;t work out, it also was a friendship that betrayed me. I decided to take time off and figure out what I really wanted to do because I feel like when you go through that degree of relationship trauma as well as work trauma, it makes you question everything. And I started questioning my relationship with SF three years in asking myself, &#8220;Is this a place where I want to be long-term? Do I even want to be a PM anymore?” I gave myself a couple months off and lived on my savings. I told myself worst comes to worst, I&#8217;ll just move back to Portland to my parents&#8217; house.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During that time, I started reflecting more and writing. I found writing to be very therapeutic for me because I was able to process a lot of the trauma, and stress, and ruminations. The absence of stress in my life was a great way to figure out what was wrong. I think it took my body actually two months to recover from working so hard and going through that traumatic startup experience. I remember hitting people up randomly on Twitter, and connecting with people&#8217;s writing, and meeting them in real life—there is no agenda. I wasn&#8217;t going to go out and get a job, it was more like I just wanted to talk to smart people and learn from them, and see if my aspiration in becoming a product manager was really grounded and was this the right direction for me. Around that time I just also started applying, interviewing, and talking to start ups as well as larger companies. I remember there was this guy that I&#8217;d met a barbeque at Stanford a year ago. He was a grad student who&#8217;s going over to work at Facebook. So I asked him, &#8220;What&#8217;s the PM profile there?&#8221;. Because I never thought I would get into Facebook. It was actually going to be a reach for me. I was curious about the PM philosophy there and I wanted to see which company I would align with the best. He had gone through his engineering camp with another girl who went through the RPM program. I remember calling her and she answer and she&#8217;s like, &#8220;You have a 503 number?!” We bonded over the fact we’re both Oregonians.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I remember hitting people up randomly on Twitter, and connecting with people&#8217;s writing, and meeting them in real life—there is no agenda.

She got into the <a href=\"http://fbrpms.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook RPM program</a>. Which is like a rotational product management program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I applied. At that point I felt like I basically had zero fucks to give anymore. It was kind of like I had reached a point where I was like, if San Francisco doesn&#8217;t work out, then I will just go back to Portland and figure it out. And it kind of got to a point where because I stopped caring and talked to so many smart people. I started interviewing around without a deliberate attachment to an end outcome, I think I accelerated my own growth and learning around product, and was able to have conversations with people and interviews that felt very organic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t know how to describe it, but it&#8217;s almost like you find your flow to a certain degree. You&#8217;re writing about things, you&#8217;re reflecting, and you&#8217;re also just like—“I just need to spread my luck surface area really thin.” I would go out of my way to tell people about my startup experiences, being very open about what worked, what didn&#8217;t work. And around that time I think I started meeting a lot of random people off of Twitter and also off of this CoffeeMe network, which was like Tinder for professionals. I remember meeting this one girl named Cindy Wu who co-founded a science crowdfunding start-up. I told her about what happened and how much betrayal and trauma I had gone through. Surprisingly, she was very not sympathetic. She was like, &#8220;So what are you going to do next?&#8221; And that moment of her asking &#8220;What are you going to do next?” was lightening. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can commiserate, I can complain all I want, I can write about all this, but essentially it&#8217;s not going to help me move on.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> remember meeting this one girl named Cindy Wu who co-founded a science crowdfunding start-up.

I felt like I found my flow talking about my story. It seemed very nonsensical—how did you go from pre-law to solar to energy efficiency to fintech but looking back, all these companies had something in common. That was behavioral change, trying to get people to switch from using the utility power to go solar, trying to motivate people to use less power, and trying to encourage the everyday person to invest more. I had subconsciously been attracted to companies that had a certain behavioral change component. I feel like if you tell your narrative enough times you find certain patterns, so around the time that I actually interviewed at Facebook, I literally felt I was so in the flow the interview became a series of organic conversations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I didn&#8217;t think I would get the offer. I also had an offer from another start-up that I had been very interested in, and basically I would have worked as the second PM. I started weighing the cost of benefits if I stay in the startup world or do I go to a larger company and learn from the best. I came to the conclusion I just want to be the best generalists as possible and go to a place where I can learn through osmosis and be with smarter people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s a certain degree of impostor syndrome going into a company like Facebook where I don&#8217;t have the pedigree and I don&#8217;t have the CS degree or the MBA. I am surrounded by very high achieving people who got this job straight out of college. I felt like every step along the way I had to prove to people that you should give me a chance. I have the potential, maybe not the background. I also felt to a certain degree like a martyr. Every employer had underestimated me, and I had proven them wrong [chuckles], but as long as I don&#8217;t underestimate myself, that was the key to me moving forward. I don&#8217;t think I intentionally tried to be a job hopper. I think every single company I worked for I wanted to stay for four years. Sunrun was two and a half years and then the Opower and SigFig stints were more brief, but I&#8217;ve never intentionally been like, &#8220;I need to leave.&#8221; I think that circumstances change, and your relationship with your employer is very much a personal relationship too and there are variables out of your control. For me, it&#8217;s always been like there needs to be some type of value compromise where I feel cared for so I can give you my all. I think I just have a lower threshold for what is acceptable and know what I deserve. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But in retrospect, you can connect the dots and be like, &#8220;Oh, this is why.&#8221; And I still live in this kind of optimistic uncertain way, where I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going to do in six months from now or a year from now. I don&#8217;t see a straight linear path, but it&#8217;s worked out so far by surprise [chuckles]. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like that a lot of people who don&#8217;t have the pedigree nor the background, nor the linear path end up taking a harder path like me, but you have a more rich and interesting story. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started writing because I wanted to reflect on these hardships and figure out what I could extract  in order to process the trauma and the emotions. I was writing for relief. I didn&#8217;t write for an audience. Writing is a very personal thing. I remember writing about my first 30 days as a PM and how I started losing my hair, which really resonated with people because I didn&#8217;t hold back. I admitted how scared I was and shared lessons, trials, and pitfalls. Me putting that out there on the internet was very cathartic, but it also rewarded me for taking a risk. I didn&#8217;t know other people were also struggling in the same way as I did. I started creating this reinforcing cycle where as long as I&#8217;m open and honest and vulnerable in my writing the internet embraced it. People started reaching out to me and meeting me in person. We connected over shared hardships was really magical. I was like, &#8220;Wow! I didn&#8217;t know I could meet so-and-so because I thought they were super accomplished and they sound really fancy on the internet.&#8221; But I read their work and they read my work and by the time we met, it was like a third or fourth conversation in. There was no small talk. I think that type of virtuous cycle of putting yourself out there, making yourself vulnerable, but then connecting with someone else unexpected the internet’s secret power.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I feel like that a lot of people who don&#8217;t have the pedigree nor the background, nor the linear path end up taking a harder path like me, but you have a more rich and interesting story.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a multipotentialite who has many callings and curiosities, I don’t think I am going to be a PM forever. I enjoy writing far more and I also enjoy connecting with people and meeting them and figuring out what makes them tick, and who can I connect them to help activate their ideas and passions.  I don&#8217;t really know a job that embodies those aspects (maybe venture?) but in the meantime I want to work on things as close as possible to writing, publishing, and media because I think that&#8217;s where my passion is. When I&#8217;m passionate about something, work just doesn&#8217;t feel like work, right?</span></p>\n<p><b>Yep.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, I&#8217;m still trying to find that alignment. I just don&#8217;t know where, or when [chuckles].</span></p>\n<p><b>What have been some of the struggles that you&#8217;ve experienced over the years in the industry that have inspired a lot of your writing?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started out writing about product management in order to establish credibility because I felt like unless I had some way of visibly putting myself out there and saying, &#8220;These are the things I learn and these are the things I did,&#8221; people wouldn’t give me the benefit of the doubt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I really felt like I had to overcome a lot of initial bias, and me establishing myself as an expert in product management would be a way to give me instant credibility, and also prove to people that someone with my non-traditional background can still do the job. Writing about product management from a diverse background helped change the industry mold for a PM. Once I got my Facebook offer I wrote about why we should give liberal arts majors a chance. It was partly due to the fact that I felt very different from everyone in the interview process, and I was told, &#8220;You&#8217;re one of our diversity spots. Like, we need to recruit people who are going to be different, and not have the cookie cutter background.” And that made me think “why did I have to go through so much of those hardships?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wrote about why liberal arts actually trains you to be a good PM. And that really helped connect a lot of people to my story, and people who also felt like they couldn&#8217;t crack into it because of their non-traditional background. I wanted to prove to people that you can differentiate yourself. In fact, those things that do make you different can add up and help you become a really great PM. When I go into a meeting I don&#8217;t think I know everything, and that makes me more inquisitive. The fact that I come from a very diverse background of econ and psych makes me think about problems differently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wanted to bring awareness around cognitive diversity. You can come from a different background whether cultural, education, or gender. You can look at the world through a different lens. Point of view is not something we can really measure, but I think you can extract someone&#8217;s worldview and perspective through their writing. Through writing I could share about what made me different. All those disadvantages that made me different became strengths over time. And other people could resonate with my differences.  And in a way</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it felt by writing about cognitive diversity and hardships I could over time change the industry norm that a PM had to be a cookie cutter, CS degree major, MBA, or someone who had ivy league degree. Beyond labels you are a patchwork of different identities and experiences, and that&#8217;s what makes you really strong at the end of the day.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I wrote about why liberal arts actually trains you to be a good PM.

As long as I keep going through life trying new things and meeting new people, and experience new things I will continue generating content. But I can&#8217;t say I only write x. It&#8217;s a mix. There&#8217;s pieces of social commentary, there&#8217;s pieces of psychology, there&#8217;s pieces of tech, and then there&#8217;s pieces of my own personal experience. So I don&#8217;t really know how to call it, what genre. Maybe the modern human condition? Hopefully one day I will be able to write a book, but I don&#8217;t really know what that would be. I did have a friend who just published a memoir, and he&#8217;s like twenty-six, twenty-seven I think.</span></p>\n<p><b>I love that.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I feel like I should secretly start writing my own memoir until I actually do something of substance, and then have the ability to publish it.</span></p>\n<p><b>My plan for this year—my resolution—is to start writing a memoir.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, do it.</span></p>\n<p><b>And just cover the first twenty-eight years.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People don&#8217;t want to admit that they&#8217;ve been preparing their memoir for awhile. But can you imagine being forty-five and then looking back and being like, what did I do in this world? You actually do need to prepare yourself.</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m curious to hear your thoughts on the current state of tech in 2016. What&#8217;s exciting to you, what frustrates you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I definitely have a love-hate relationship with tech as well as with San Francisco. I think part of it is just the fact that I am morbidly afraid of only having one way of looking at things. Every time I get out of San Francisco I&#8217;m always so relieved that I&#8217;m no longer in this very insulating and myopic space. I think people have been generating successful companies in a very homogeneous, formulaic manner. You need to have gone to certain school or worked at a certain company, and then from there you meet certain people, and then you generate ideas together, and then you get funding. There&#8217;s just so much in-bred talent, it&#8217;s almost like everyone&#8217;s a purebred. And over time purebreds breed with purebreds and there is no hybrid vigor. Ideas just get more and more diluted. A lot of ideas behind products are serving the one percent. When you don&#8217;t have an awareness of how other people live then you keep circulating the same ideas. My biggest concern is how homogeneous and monoculture we can become. For example, yesterday I went to Garfield Community Pool. It was kind of like a shitty pool with beat up locker rooms. It was not your nice, posh gym, but everyone there was nice. I had like five people tell me, &#8220;have a good swim.&#8221; You know? I just felt like, wow, these are the type of people who come to a pool for a sense of community, not to further themselves. I want to be with real people without self-interested motivations.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;When you don&#8217;t have an awareness of how other people live then you keep circulating the same ideas.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think a lot of what the industry has turned into is like, how can I further myself and be the next unicorn? It&#8217;s not about connecting with other people. And I even feel this through networking. Like so and so makes and intro—they want to connect with me and I feel obligated to talk to them because they&#8217;re a mutual friend, right? When I was in Tel Aviv people who didn&#8217;t know me would like offer to connect me to someone else. There was no notion of a referral system based on social currency. Tel Aviv had a culture of default openness. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you are driven by motives—and a certain how I should replicate a pattern of success—you stop thinking about new ideas, and you kind of stop innovating, right? So I think right now it&#8217;s just like there&#8217;s too much homogenous thinking. There&#8217;s a certain pattern of success that everyone wants to replicate and be the next blank, and be the next unicorn, right? </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And there&#8217;s not enough awareness of what is going on outside of the Bay area. What&#8217;s the rest of the world doing?</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was talking to startups in Tel Aviv, they were like, &#8220;Yeah we know the Israeli market is super small. So every product we make we think about building this for the rest of the world.&#8221; And I don&#8217;t think a lot of companies within the Bay area think about it, because it&#8217;s like they&#8217;re preoccupied with who&#8217;s going to be on TechCrunch, who&#8217;s going to be featured on Product Hunt? Do I know the right person? Who&#8217;s going to retweet me? And it&#8217;s all become like this insular circle jerking community of like, &#8220;You recommend me, I recommend you.&#8221; I don&#8217;t think tech in the Bay Area is as open and authentic anymore. And it makes me sad because </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I want to be friends with people, not because they work at X, I want to be friends with people because I genuinely appreciate them, and we have something in common, and it&#8217;s not just over work or us working in an industry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I want to meet more people like I did at the community pool. They were just by default very open and nice, and they came to a pool to have a good time and to exercise. It wasn&#8217;t in order to meet certain types of people. And I see that with networking too, where people are very motive driven. And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;What can I do for you? What can you do for me?&#8221; And that immediate transactional relationship carries throughout the entire industry now. And I don&#8217;t know how to correct it. I don&#8217;t want to be friends with people in order to get something out of it. And I think there&#8217;s a certain degree of reciprocity in every relationship we have that&#8217;s not immediate, right? So I honestly am kind of sad by the current state and I can always tell when some company is going to be the next cool kid, but I know that cool kid title will never be sustained, right? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone plays in the whole like, &#8220;Maximize your mentality, I need to be the next big thing, and I need to be super flashy and sexy.&#8221; And to a certain degree I don&#8217;t think sustainability is top of the mind. For you to be a world class company that really addresses human problems, you have to be sustainable over time too. Right now, I&#8217;m just seeing a lot forgiving money getting doled out by virtue of someone having connections or someone having proven themselves once and then working on ideas for the one percent. I also see people just trying to get acquired super fast or trying to make some fast cash. That notion of sustainability of you working on a problem for a very long time and feeling like it&#8217;s solving human people problems, not just moving metrics or making a lot of money, is becoming lost.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VCs have to realize a lot of their investments are not going to pan out. In two years from now there&#8217;s like a cooling effect, which sounds really bad, but I actually think a cooling effect would be really good, because that&#8217;s going to separate the wheat from the chaff. The strong, sustainable companies that are doing it slow and deliberately and focus on solving people problems instead of lifestyle companies or things for the top 1% will last. I think that a cooling down effect will course correct things from the current trajectory, but at this point, it almost feels like the Wolf of Wall Street a little bit. </span></p>\n<p><b>Let&#8217;s do one more question. What are some of the biggest lessons that you&#8217;ve learned, and what advice would you give to people from similar backgrounds? Just like normal people, who aren&#8217;t Ivy Leaguers, who have the talent, and the aptitude, and the potential, but there&#8217;s kind of system in place that they&#8217;re going to have to swim upstream in. What advice would you have for those folks who want to get into tech? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think a lot of it has to do with your own self-worth, and you not letting defined standards make you feel that you&#8217;re not qualified.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I think if you can generate something of value and make it visible, and show people I did this then you prove yourself. No one&#8217;s going to hire you based off of potential. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don&#8217;t have the right background or pedigree, you&#8217;re always going to face a lot of doubt, and the best way to counteract doubt is to have a visible output of your work, right? Whether that be you built something, you wrote something, you shared something with the world that was helpful.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you had enough time, I think you start building your own track record where it&#8217;s not about someone looking at your pedigree, but looking at what did you produce. What you generate is way more telling than someone who went to an Ivy or someone who has an MBA. I think in a way you almost have to come up with your own standards and definition for every role that you apply. I think if you do this enough times, there is less and less stigma against you.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think a lot of it has to do with your own self-worth, and you not letting defined standards make you feel that you&#8217;re not qualified.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, my my narrative of having worked for, what is it, four companies now? It actually seems really interesting, but when I was going through it it was a shitty experience. I kept thinking &#8220;Why can&#8217;t I just find a linear path to becoming a PM?&#8221;  So, I think </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">if you see all those trials and tribulations as growth opportunities then you’ll will have a more interesting story to tell.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have to turn disadvantages into your advantage.  I think if you feel like you&#8217;re not going to get into a certain job or company because of your pedigree, you should just start doing your own thing.  If you do it enough times, that incremental value accumulates over time and it&#8217;s going to shift people&#8217;s focus on what you don&#8217;t have towards what you do have.  Which is like, &#8220;I produced X.&#8221;  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think eventually if enough people do this—you basically debunk the whole system of you need to check these boxes in order to be qualified for something.  And I&#8217;ve seen this trend in PMs now.  A lot of people aren&#8217;t hiring for technical backgrounds anymore because there are a lot of strong operators who can build stuff but they don&#8217;t validate if it&#8217;s the right product. How do you build products that connect with people and build an emotional connection? That&#8217;s not something you can learn through coding or through an MBA program. There needs to be a certain degree of empathy and all those soft skills that people don&#8217;t measure actually add up. I don&#8217;t know how you can exemplify those soft skills without a really compelling narrative. Me talking about how I think in terms of behavioral science and psychology when it comes to product development is very refreshing and different. To a certain degree, tech now has the fundamentals, we have the Internet, and we have the cloud. It&#8217;s all about the next layer of human technology we can build. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That degree of empathy is something that you have to earn through hardship and through failure.

Tell me about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I used to be resentful about growing up in Connecticut, but as I get older, I think I become more and more Connecticut-y. It was a very Puritan, affluent, seat-of-the-American-Revolution type of town, and </span>my siblings and I were the token Asian kids in all of our classes. This one time in history class, we were talking about Charlemagne or something, and the teacher said, “Did you know that everyone of European descent is actually related to Charlemagne?” And everyone in the class just turned around and looked at me. So unsurprisingly, I didn’t really feel like a part of the community.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My parents both worked. I didn’t really think anything of it when I was growing up, but I had a lot of time to myself. There was this expectation from my parents: “We’re not going to entertain you. You have to entertain yourself. Go to school and get good grades. Do your own thing.” I drew a lot, wrote little stories, all the kid things. In high school, I was super into smudgy digital paintings of fantasy things and making weird emo websites.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;My siblings and I were the token Asian kids in all of our classes.

So unsurprisingly, I didn’t really feel like a part of the community.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>When did you first get really interested in tech? Or did you not get interested until you were kind of in it?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was always into it, I think, but I didn’t know it. My dad encouraged me to code sites. </span>When I was 11 or 12 I was making Neopets fansites and things like that.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In high school I had this realization that it wasn’t something girls were ‘supposed’ to do. </span>There was this message floating around, “you’re a geek girl. You built your own computer.” I just did it for fun. From there I thought, “well, I must be a tomboy,” and that became part of my identity. In retrospect it’s very disturbing. “I’m a non-girl. I don’t have girl friends. I’m one of the guys. I am literally not a woman, because women don’t build things.” I didn’t realize how problematic this was until I was in my twenties.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there, I went to <a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Carnegie Mellon’s</a> design school, which was great. We had a lot of female professors that we respected and my class had a good mix of genders and at least some diversity.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My dad encouraged me to code sites. </span>When I was 11 or 12 I was making Neopets fansites and things like that.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In high school I had this realization that it wasn’t something girls were ‘supposed’ to do. </span>There was this message floating around, &#8216;you’re a geek girl.

Advertising is a weird beast.</p>\n<p><b>Yeah, I have friends who have transitioned from ads to tech, too. They told me about the ad years, which sound way rougher, honestly.</b></p>\n<p>I think everything is just less hidden. I think things are more, “welp! It’s going to be like this, and that’s the way it is!” There’s some truth to the Mad Men stereotype, the glorification, the partying, using client dollars and working yourself into a stupor.</p>\n<p><b>Yeah. I think I saw in the news—a girl in Singapore that worked three days straight and died of heart failure. She was like 20, you know, a copywriter.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s so not worth it. But you think, this is what I have to do to get ahead.</span></p>\n<p><b>Walk me through the path from agency to tech to independence.</b></p>\n<p>In short, I saw what they charged for me and what they were paying m<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">e. </span>This was probably true at any creative agency of that era. Not only were they paying me a quarter of what they were charging for me, but they were also lying about there being x numbers of designers on the project. It was just me. I thought, maybe I should just do this on my own, even if I can get only a few clients. If I charged half of what they were charging, I could make a living.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> At that point, I wasn’t used to making a ton of money anyway.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I graduated during the recession, so I know what it’s like not to be able to get a job. </span>I sent out over sixty applications trying to get my first gig, and only ended up getting requests to interview from two people. This is after attending a great university with a string of internships under my belt. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was ready after graduation to work as a barista or a librarian to move to San Francisco, so I was still up for that as a last resort.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I saw what they charged for me and what they were paying m<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">e. </span>This was probably true at any creative agency of that era.

I had no idea what I was doing, but even with my then-paltry San Francisco connections, I carved out a living.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was posting on <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dribbble</a> a lot, and one day <a href=\"http://markdotto.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Otto</a> (who was at Twitter at the time) said, “Hey, why don’t you come have lunch?” I still love Twitter and use it a lot. Everyone seemed super nice, and it would be a prestigious place to work, so it checked all the boxes. I stayed for about a year, doing brand and marketing design. The company grew from 500 to 1000 people while I was there, which started to feel too big.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s when I started peeking over at Pinterest. It was just 35 people when I joined. What really attracted me was the userbase, which was not a typical techie-first audience. It was people who had jobs outside of Silicon Valley, who lived all across the country, and had families and other aspirations. The ethos of the company felt really homey, where we’d unironically make Valentines for each other. I always wanted to go independent again, but I figured I’d stay at Pinterest for 4 years as my last gig. Then, they grew to 300 people in the space of two years, which was even more stressful than when Twitter grew. I could only take two years of hypergrowth before I had to leave.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I sent out over sixty applications trying to get my first gig, and only ended up getting requests to interview from two people. This is after attending a great university with a string of internships under my belt.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve been independent for about two years now.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are the things that were really exciting that you took away from your time working in-house? And then what was not so great?</b></p>\n<p>I met so many good people working full-time. It’s one of my fantasies to move to the middle of nowhere and have a crazy farm, but it’s hard to leave the Bay Area because I know so many awesome people. I do feel like for all its faults there’s a great community out here, especially a female community, which is something I’ve needed and cherish.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a lot of stuff I didn’t love, too. </span>By the end of my full-time adventures, I was having health problems, things I’d never experienced before. I had full body rashes and new allergies. I was constantly getting sick to the point of being bedridden, and doctors couldn’t figure out what was going on. I don’t have any of these problems today. It’s as if my body was like, nope. You’ve got to chill the fuck out.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout my life, I’ve always wanted to seek creative criticism and wanted to get to the next level, but I never doubted myself. My early 20s and mid-twenties was all doubt, though. When I was leaving full-time work, I was evaluating if I should even stay in design. I was ready to quit the industry, quit being a designer because I’d become convinced that I was not good enough to hack it. I wasn’t producing good work, it was like in sports, I had the yips. It’s really depressing looking back on that era, because I know now that there’s so much out there for me. I’m glad I got out when I did.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;By the end of my full-time adventures, I was having health problems, things I’d never experienced before.

Confidence through the roof, and then she moved to tech, where I met her at my tiny little startup, and I watched our young, inexperienced bosses just destroy her confidence and it&#8217;s never really come back even though she&#8217;s worked at better and better jobs and does incredible work. And I just still see her not fully believe in her work, even though I&#8217;m like &#8220;look at what you&#8217;re making,&#8221; you know? And I&#8217;m like, what did tech do to her to make her feel that way?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s still a bit of a mystery to me. When I left I had this realization that I was internalizing a lot of things. One example is how old I look. </span>I’m almost 30, but Lyft drivers will ask me if I’m headed to class. A worker at the DMV asked if I was there to take the driving test. I’m sure I’ll be happy about this when I’m older, but it’s easy to feel like my face is betraying me.</p>\n<p>I realized it wasn’t my face betraying me, though. It’s my face, it can’t do such a thing. Part of being independent meant I could stop feeling like I was fighting others’ notions of me, that I could stop fighting my own face.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Throughout my life, I’ve always wanted to seek creative criticism and wanted to get to the next level, but I never doubted myself.

I got so sick of thinking, “Oh, if I dressed exceptionally well (but not too well), people wouldn’t discount my opinions. If I smile the right amount (but not too much); if I use enough emojis in my emails.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. You wrote a <a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/a-woman-who-happens-to-tech-c76b6a6d8527#.xtn92lzf8\">medium post</a> highlighting some of your experiences in tech, and that resonated with quite a few people, including myself. For those who haven&#8217;t read it, who will read this, walk me through some of those experiences.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was debating whether or not to leave tech altogether, I was so jaded. I spent about a year being totally burned out. I couldn’t even click on links about “woman sues x for discrimination” or “x scandal” because they would make me so angry. But tech keeps drawing me back in, because of that same attitude I had as a kid, where I didn’t know I was interested in tech. I just wanted to make cool stuff, to express myself, to be heard.</span> Tech is not the point. People are the point, and tech’s supposed to be in service of people.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I’m so looking forward to the day when teens are making one-use apps that are like, Beyonce lyrics and things like that. The things we see as deeply technical are going to get more democratic and more accessible until they become as common as shooting off an email. That’s my hope.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the meantime, I’ve sort of given up the idea that I can succeed in a traditional tech role. I’m sure a job is out there for me, but it’s not going to be in the majority. It doesn’t make much sense for me to look, statistics not being on my side, especially when I can carve out my own business and feel like I have power again.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Tech is not the point. People are the point, and tech’s supposed to be in service of people.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>I think you can probably relate, where one of my biggest issues was feeling like I didn&#8217;t have any runway. And just knowing the work that I could do if I was allowed, and not being able to perform in a way that would have been good for the company. I felt like I was constantly being kept in a box and prevented from helping in significant ways.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s like there’s a code you can’t crack.</span> I’d see a problem, see a way forward, a way to get it done. But then I would come up against friction: “You have to do this list of process to get that done.” So, I’d do those things and then the response would be, “You follow the rules too much, why can’t you just take initiative and do it?” So, I’d break the rules, usually emulating male coworkers, and then suddenly I’m branded a troublesome employee. At that point, the game is rigged, isn’t it? There’s no path forward, to the point where I’d ask, “would it be better for me to do nothing?” and I kid you not, the answer was sometimes, “that’s probably for the best.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This didn’t work for me. I’m genuinely curious if it would work for anyone. I was a very bossy, stubborn child. I was always raising my hand in class in the front row. I was that girl. But after this slow draining, this slow reward after reward for being malleable and feeble, I was becoming one of those people who were averse to conflict for the sake of appearing easy to deal with.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’d see a problem, see a way forward, a way to get it done.

Or was there like a moment when you were like, &#8220;Ok. Here&#8217;s my plan on getting out.&#8221;?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had this story in my head that I was just an unhappy, ungrateful person. That even if I had the world, I’d still be a grouchy, angry person who wouldn’t be able to sleep at night. It had been building for a while, but I think I woke up one day and thought, this is not sustainable. I have everything, and I’m wasting it. Two generations ago, my family was fleeing war and hiding in haybales, getting bayonetted at by soldiers. For me not to take the leap when I could does nobody honor.</span></p>\n<p><b>So how much of that has resolved for you working as a freelancer?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It changed so quickly. Of course I had moments where I was insecure, where I worried that no one would want to work with me, where I thought the money would dry up. Instead, I found that there were really loving, enthusiastic people out there who just wanted to make stuff together. It was a revival for me, a restoration of faith. My work immediately improved. It was such a relief.</span></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s such a bummer that so many people can go from extremely confident people and end up in an environment where we are turned into people who don&#8217;t feel valid whatsoever, end up having to repair it ourselves on our own, and then end up thriving.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a self-fulfilling cycle, when someone says, “I don’t have faith in you.” People would be surprised constantly at my age, my experience, and I realized they were making all of these underlying assumptions about me. There would be people who were like, “Oh, Ash is so sweet.” And I was like, “whoa, that’s an adjective a mother or boyfriend should be using, not you, coworker. Besides, did you not see all the Instagrams I took in the cemetery? All the black I wear?” To undo all those assumptions is a whole &#8216;nother job.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s such a bummer that so many people can go from extremely confident people and end up in an environment where we are turned into people who don&#8217;t feel valid whatsoever, end up having to repair it ourselves on our own, and then end up thriving.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had managers call me sweetheart when they weren’t thinking, off the cuff. </span>I’ve had people scold me for writing emails that were not strongly worded in the least. I’ve had people tell me not to go to company sponsored classes because I’d be ‘in over my head,’ that I ‘didn’t have enough experience’, and then I’d see a bunch of men there that were way less experienced at coding than I was. I would have managers not tell me important information because of some virtuous paternalism, and then it would limit my ability to do my job. And that would result in people labeling me incompetent, junior, thinking, “maybe there’s a reason we don’t tell her everything.”</p>\n<p>People don’t do it out of malice. Almost all of these people are nice humans, they have families and will smile when you talk to them. It’s just all these assumptions they don’t realize they are making which slowly wear away at women’s reputations.</p>\n<p><b>Did you have any mentors in the industry or people that inspired you on the positive end?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My first job, I worked with a badass art director, Christina Rinaldi. She was my first example of what being a working woman could mean. She was first and foremost a great designer, so creative, but she was short like me and wore heels. She never tried to hide the fact that she was female.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now I feel fortunate that I’m surrounded by lots of awesome women. My friend Alice Lee uses the term ‘friendtors.’ I have this loving coven around me. I’ve had male mentors as well, which I think is important. I don’t think a lot of men naturally gravitate towards mentoring women, but in this climate it can be hard to find a female mentor.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had managers call me sweetheart when they weren’t thinking, off the cuff. </span>I’ve had people scold me for writing emails that were not strongly worded in the least.

My parents I think are just pleased I’m self-sufficient. They try to be supportive, but I do think they wonder what I do every day. My dad came to my senior project at school and looked around at our work. He said, “There is some theme here, but I don’t know what it is.”</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m always curious to know the secret sauce or the common trait that allows people to start their own thing, which is absolutely not what most people want to do. What do you think that is for you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can’t say for sure. I’m pretty stubborn, which helps. I think for me, I just want to be free. I want to solve problems and tell stories without all the man-made conflict. There’s a lot of that personality in Silicon Valley, the one that gets a little kick out of debate club, of watching people squirm and setting stuff on proverbial fire. I’ve turned into a giant California hippie. I’m into the idea of cooperation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think the other thing is that I’m actually scared and embarrassed most of the time. Like, I have this phobia that my phone is going to bounce into a sewer grate twenty feet away when I’m holding it, I’ve slipped on banana peels and run into glass doors. That constant state of anxiety is a blessing, though, because when I get scared of running my own business, it’s kind of just another fear for the pile.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you feel about the state of tech right now?</b></p>\n<p>If someone else tells me tech is a meritocracy, I’m going to fucking scream. I think there’s a lot more awareness that we’re all biased and raised to be racists, even (maybe especially) minorities. And I think the goal of talking about it is to just be more mindful. No need to be perfect, just be aware and try not to do nasty stuff, apologize when you’re hurtful. But some people are still so defensive about it. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can say, “hey, that was kind of misogynist, please don’t say that,” and the response is, “I’m not a misogynist!!” And that totally derails an expression of discomfort into a cosmic, immovable perception of someone’s ego, which was not the point. </span>It’s like saying, “you’re standing on my foot,” and the other person saying, “I’m not fat!”</p>\n<p>Wouldn’t you want to be told? I think it’s so ironic, tech is always asking for quantitative affirmation, for data, but the data that says diverse companies do better is ignored. I’m an optimist, though. The way things are going, if you’re going to ignore inclusivity, you’re going to be a dinosaur in a few years and the diverse companies are going to crush you.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I guess we’ll see.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;If someone else tells me tech is a meritocracy, I’m going to fucking scream.

There is so much conversation around pipeline, but not many people talk about retention. What do you think tech could do to not lose more talent?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s a hard one, because the only way I could figure out how to work in tech and not have my creativity destroyed was to exist on the fringes. </span>Number one, we need more diverse founders. I saw some sad statistic recently that women founded companies make up a single-digit percentage of companies funded here. There are plenty of female entrepreneurs who don’t do things tech finds glamorous: fashion bloggers, YouTube stars, self-help gurus. So the idea that this is a meritocracy and that women just aren’t interested in being entrepreneurial is ridiculous.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think we also need to put our monies where our mouths are and be open to criticism and dialogue. Again, it’s just so deeply ironic—people will seek out user feedback and try to get people to bash their apps so they can improve them, but then shrug off any critique on how their company about page is a wall of young white men.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other thing I’m doing right now that feels more subversive is making things for the female gaze rather than the male gaze. So not everything has to be a stoic flag on a hill. Just be better humans day to day, or try to be.</span></p>\n<p><b>Have you seen your personality change since you went independent?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, I feel more like myself. Now if I don’t want to do something, I’m pretty clear about it, to the point where I’ll surprise myself. Like, I didn’t know I had an opinion on that! I don’t put 3 emoticons in every single email. I still put them in because I like them and think they’re funny, but not to seem cute or innocuous. I’m a lot better with boundaries, I won’t check email on weekends—well, I shouldn’t say never; sometimes it’s necessary, but if so, someone’s going to pay Oprah dollars for that time.</span></p>\n<p><b>Honestly I feel 10 years younger.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People see me and they say, you look great. I&#8217;m just like, God, what did I look like before?</span></p>\n<p><b>Covered in rashes.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blotchy and sad.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in 5 or 10 years?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m really enjoying my life right now. I would love to get to a place where I’m doing only independent projects of all kinds. I’ve always been one of those people who’s been interested in 20 things at once, which I think is sometimes punished in full-time work. “Oh, you’re erratic, you can’t focus.” And it’s less about focus than multi-tasking. I want to build apps, I want to keep publishing books, and it all seems possible.</span></p>\n<p><b>What advice would you give folks who have had similar experiences to you in tech or even just girls hoping to get into tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s a big one. One thing is that </span>most of the women I know have gone through this deep experience, almost a second, older adolescence where they figure out what they actually want, versus what they are told is desirable.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Everyone was pushing me into management.

Taking the time to outline what it is you as an individual want is so important.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It will probably confuse people (when I left Pinterest, some random guy I knew in high school literally commented “noooooooo!” on my announcement) but if you know it’s what you want, it won’t bother you so much.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Most of the women I know have gone through this deep experience, almost a second, older adolescence where they figure out what they actually want, versus what they are told is desirable. I think people are very quick to tell women what they want and shouldn’t want.

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Okay, let&#8217;s start at the beginning. Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p>I was born on an Air Force base in Arkansas, but I grew up in Huntsville, Alabama. My dad was a pilot and my mom was a dietitian. I was a fairly nerdy and shy kid. I remember my first experience programming was in fourth grade &#8211; which is very unique. It was kind of amazing that my elementary school had a computer lab at all. I would hang out in there because it had a few fun video games (here&#8217;s looking at you, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_(video_game)\">Oregon Trail</a>). One time I figured out how to play the Star Wars Main Theme with MS-DOS. That was the first computer program I ever wrote. Unfortunately, that was the only real computer program I wrote for about 17 years. In middle school I would tinker with Geocities and Angelfire for hours at night, but I had no idea that people could build websites for a living. I even took the first ever AP Computer Science class in my high school (where I ended up playing 1000% more Quake than learning any CS because the teacher didn&#8217;t know the material). Even though I showed interest and had aptitude, I never really knew I could be a software engineer. It just wasn&#8217;t something that was on my radar.</p>\n<p><b>I am curious to know what it was like being a creative, slightly nerdy kid in the south? As someone who was a creative kind of nerdy kid in the south.</b></p>\n<p>I felt like a fish out of water. In some ways, that experience made me more creative. I would escape into painting, drawing, books or video games. I would day dream a lot.</p>\n<p>I think that&#8217;s why I eventually decided to study graphic design and art history at Auburn University. My grandmother was an artist and I was always involved with art, so I knew that I wanted to do something visual. But, I also knew I wanted to do something with computers. Graphic design seemed like a natural choice.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s funny, as a kid my grandmother actually taught me how to use a computer. She had an ebay shop (her username was cellar, which is clever) where she sold antiques, and she would pay me by the hour to upload images with her FTP client and manage some of her listings. I didn&#8217;t realize at the time what a cool experience that was. I was a young woman, maybe 10 years old in Alabama, being taught how to use a computer by her <em>grandmother</em>.</p>\n<p><b>You studied design/art history in academia. What was the impetus for being like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to learn to code now.&#8221;</b></p>\n<p>It was out of necessity. I graduated in 2008 which was the beginning of the recession (but we weren&#8217;t calling it that yet). I was completely broke and the only design jobs I could find involved some kind of web development. I had minimal programming experience in school, I had only done some ActionScript, some Flash, things like that, but nothing seriously.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I had a professor at Auburn that told me, &#8220;just tell them you can do something, and figure it out when you get there.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>So, I started taking jobs where HTML and CSS knowledge were required. Then, one where I needed to learn jQuery. Then, one where I had to know some PHP. I would just study like crazy for interviews, and each time I would get a job that was a little more technical and was a little more programming focused.</p>\n<p>Eventually I wanted to double down and legitimize myself as a software engineer. I ended up moving to New York City to go to a programming school which is now called Recurse Center. I found the program by accident, I was just reading articles late at night and I saw a post saying Etsy would sponsor women to go to this school. So, I applied. And, I actually lied to get in. I told them I had JavaScript experience but I didn&#8217;t. I knew the entrance exam would involve writing a Fizz Buzz application, so I just memorized it so I could write it in the interview. I knew if I could just get in I would figure it all out, and thankfully I was right.</p>\n<p><b>So you were in New York. What eventually transitioned you to Silicon Valley?</b></p>\n<p>I accepted a job from Etsy (in New York) out of Recurse Center. It was my first real software engineering job, and at the time it was my dream job. Unfortunately it was a rough transition. At that point, I had 3 months of coding experience and was working in a team that well&#8230;just wasn&#8217;t working. I was in a tough situation and things were not working out with my manager.</p>\n<blockquote><p>One day my manager told me, &#8220;Martha, you&#8217;re a bad programmer and you&#8217;ll never make it as an engineer.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>And it crushed me.</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah, that&#8217;s literally enough for you to never go back into development again.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, I almost didn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>Eventually I just kind of washed my hands of it and moved on. Deep down I knew that he was wrong. And, I knew I really wanted this. I&#8217;m so thankful I realized that.</p>\n<p>So, I ended up moving to San Francisco and joining Uber. That decision changed my life. I&#8217;ve found a team where I&#8217;m a good fit, and I&#8217;ve been kicking ass. I was promoted last year, and I&#8217;m hopeful it could happen again this year.</p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s so great. Tell me a bit about what elements of your work really excite you and what really activates you in your work.</b></p>\n<p>I really love what I do. So, I happen to be on a  platform team at Uber. That means my customers are my peers, other engineers at the company. It&#8217;s incredibly validating and exciting for me when they enjoy using the tools I&#8217;ve built to help them do their job. I also just really like writing scripts and building applications and watching them work. I feel like a wizard, sometimes, especially when I can help someone debug a random issue they&#8217;re having. Software is a really fun field because you can constantly learn something new and improve yourself. I like that I&#8217;m opinionated about certain technical decisions because I have experience that formed those opinions. I&#8217;m also proud that I&#8217;m known for a high bar of code quality. Just seeing myself improve really activates me.</p>\n<p><strong>What else have been some of your biggest roadblocks and struggles, and just hardships you&#8217;ve had to overcome?</strong></p>\n<p>There were, and are, struggles. It&#8217;s hard for people to assume you&#8217;re not very technical, or that you&#8217;re not an engineer at all. Or, to be the only woman engineer on a team (or in a company). Before I went to NYC, I was working at a company where I was the only woman on the engineering team out of around 70 people, and I remember, we had this communal chat room where we all would just chat all day long. One day someone posted some pornographic images in chat, and I remember saying, &#8220;This is inappropriate, don&#8217;t post that in work chat.&#8221; <em>They told me to stop  being a girl about it.</em> I remember, they had no HR. It was like a startup at that point, so I just had to deal with it. Another time we had a meeting to talk about our benefits, and there was no mention of maternity leave. I just remember raising my hand and asking, &#8220;Is that something that you offer?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No, we&#8217;ve never had to offer it before.&#8221; Those two events really made me think about what I was doing, or the kind of environment that I was in.</p>\n<p>In Silicon Valley you hear the word &#8216;meritocracy&#8217; thrown around a lot. I don&#8217;t believe tech is a meritocracy.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sometimes I joke that there&#8217;s a silicon ceiling in Silicon Valley. And silicon is harder than glass.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>[laughter]</strong></p>\n<p>I also think women&#8217;s contributions aren&#8217;t recognized as often as their male peers. I think we&#8217;re underpaid. I&#8217;m reminded of a quote in Ender&#8217;s game, as a woman you really have to be &#8220;so good at what you do that they can&#8217;t ignore you.&#8221; Struggling against these things has made me work harder and become a better person and a stronger engineer, but it&#8217;s frustrating as hell. I honestly believe if you are a minority in tech, you are probably extraordinarily good at your job. You really have to be, to overcome people&#8217;s misconceptions about you.</p>\n<p><strong>In your pre-interview, you mentioned the challenge of surviving tech culture without losing yourself. Tell me about that.</strong></p>\n<p>Absolutely. I have this conversation with a lot of young engineers. It&#8217;s (understandably) easy to want to assimilate yourself into techbro culture. Early in my career I would wear the hoodie, laugh at the inappropriate jokes, and water down my femininity so I would be taken seriously. I don&#8217;t do that anymore. I finally realized if I don&#8217;t bring my full self with me to work I&#8217;m not doing myself or anyone else any favors. I think it does everyone some good to see engineers around the office that don&#8217;t fit the stereotypes.</p>\n<p><strong>Based on your life experience, what advice would you give to folks from similar backgrounds to you in tech?</strong></p>\n<p>Be good at teaching yourself. Be self motivated. Be okay with failure and days lost to an errant comma. Learn the vocabulary. Be precise when you say something. Don&#8217;t struggle alone with a problem for too long. Learn to ask questions effectively so people can help you quickly. Always read error messages thoroughly. Every bug or mistake is a learning opportunity.</p>\n<p>Know that this is worth fighting for. I hope you can find the strength within yourself to keep going when people tell you that you can&#8217;t do something. They don&#8217;t determine whether you can or can&#8217;t do something, you do.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Know that this is worth fighting for.

When I was 8, we moved to the Philippines where I lived for 15 years, so I pretty much grew up there. </span></p>\n<p><b>What was it like growing up there? Especially as someone who had a taste of the States.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was difficult at first because I didn&#8217;t speak Filipino, so I had a tutor to learn it. It was weird at first because obviously I look Filipino, but other kids treated me differently because I didn’t speak the language and I sounded different.  But I was young so I adjusted quickly. I started college when I was 16 and majored in Computer Science.  The plan was always to come back to U.S after we graduate, but I had a little detour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my senior year, I had an unplanned pregnancy. It was really difficult being in a Catholic university in a conservative and predominantly-Catholic country.  I felt like I disappointed my parents and was a cause of embarrassment in the family.  I was a good kid, I had good grades and a good life, I just made a bad decision.  I was fortunate that my mom really pushed for me to finish college.  A lot of other girls in the same situation would have dropped out of school because the family wouldn’t be able to face that embarrassment. I got married then a few months later I had my daughter.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;In my senior year, I had an unplanned pregnancy. It was really difficult being in a Catholic university in a conservative and predominantly-Catholic country.  I felt like I disappointed my parents and was a cause of embarrassment in the family.  I was a good kid, I had good grades and a good life, I just made a bad decision.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had to postpone a final project presentation because she arrived 2 weeks early.    Because I was busy with my senior year, I didn’t have time to attend childbirth classes or read books.  I didn’t even know an epidural existed until years later!  A week after giving birth, I had to go back to school for final exams. I wasn’t planning on attending graduation but I found out that I graduated cum laude and actually 3rd in my class. My parents attended and they were happy and proud of me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After graduation, my husband and I each moved back with our parents. My parents offered to look after my daughter so I could work.  My mom was a stay-at-home mom and didn’t get to use her Engineering degree and she said “I want you to have a career.&#8221;  But in the small hometown where we lived, there were no software jobs.  This was back in 1999 and unless you lived in Manila, there wasn’t much to do with a CS degree.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not that I had the time or energy to really think about my career. I was pretty much in survival mode and all I needed was a job so i can feed my baby. I got a job teaching at a small technical college and after a semester, I worked for another company but didn’t really use much related to CS.  My husband and I split up in the meantime.  It was a lot of stress for a young marriage.   </span></p>\n<p><b>What did you do to try to turn things around?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After my daughter turned 2, I decided it was time to come back to the US to find a better job.  My sister was kind enough to lend me money for a one-way ticket to Texas where she and my other sister lived.  The hardest part was leaving my daughter with my parents.  But I had to until I could find a job and be able to afford to support the both of us.  It was pretty scary. It was 2001 during a recession and it was hard to find a job.  I had a few temp jobs doing random things, like sorting mail and data entry.  Finally, a small software company hired me to do customer service. I was able to save some money, and after 7 months of being apart, my parents brought my daughter here. I stayed at that company for 7 years, and I went from customer service to QA.  In the middle of this, I remarried then after 3 years got divorced to get out of an unhealthy relationship.  On top of that I had $24,000 in debt.  I really made all my stupid decisions in my 20s. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;After my daughter turned 2, I decided it was time to come back to the US to find a better job.  My sister was kind enough to lend me money for a one-way ticket to Texas where she and my other sister lived.  The hardest part was leaving my daughter with my parents.  But I had to until I could find a job and be able to afford to support the both of us.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I then moved to a big semiconductor company where I stayed for 4 years. My life started stabilizing in my 30s.  It took me 2 years to get completely get out of debt.  I was making better money.  And I was in a healthy relationship.  After Thanksgiving in 2012, most of our business unit got laid off. It was my first time to experience this. It was scary especially being in a single income household.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All these years I was in a career crisis. I didn&#8217;t really know what I wanted to be when I grow up [chuckle]. I always hear “follow your passion” but this was never clear to me.  I have a lot of things I’m interested in but none that I’m both passionate about and am good enough at to make a living.  If I had followed that advice, I’d probably be a failed travel blogger. So back to getting laid off.  Part of our package was tuition reimbursement. The idea was for the company to pay for you to acquire some skill to get a new job. It wasn’t enough money to get a new degree and believe it or not, I used to dream up my ideal job and think, if only I studied to become a lawyer or an accountant! In the end, I thought, okay, practically speaking, with this amount, what can I do?  Well, I have a CS degree and I haven&#8217;t written a single line of code since I graduated so maybe I should learn a new language.  I searched for the top jobs in my field.  I looked at jobs at Google, Amazon, and Apple, and I was just curious, what kind of skills are they looking for?  Long story short, I signed up for an online Python class.   It was difficult at first to get started, but I realized that the concepts that I knew were the same, just the syntax was different.  It was like falling in love again!  It was exciting solving each problem, the same feeling I had solving problems in BASIC when I was 9, and Pascal in college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the meantime, Amazon had contacted me and many of my co-workers through LinkedIn because a lot of the skills we had in embedded software were what they were looking for.  I went for the interview thinking, &#8220;This is really going to be a practice interview. There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m moving to California.&#8221; [chuckle].  I got a job offer, and it was compelling enough for me to consider it. It was a hard decision to leave my support system, and move to a place that I&#8217;ve never been to before where the cost of living is just so high.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The move turned out to be the best thing that happened to my career!  I continued learning Python and applying it at work.  I found that the better I got, the more I felt enjoyment and passion in my work. The move also turned out to be great for my daughter, being able to play in one of the top high school drum lines in the US. She cried at first because she would be leaving friends and going to a new high school.  But she said, &#8220;If you think that&#8217;s what best for us, then I will support you.”   </span></p>\n<p><b>Like a little adult.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. I think because it&#8217;s just the two of us, I tend to talk with her about everything, including finances. So she understood why we made the move.  Anyway, I feel like I have so much energy and desire to learn new things.  Next year she’ll be off to college so I’ll even have more time to focus and go on to the next phase of my career. </span></p>\n<p><b>What a story. What overall is the most exciting to you about working in tech? What things are you really proud of and what about the work really activates you?</b></p>\n<p>What I love about working in tech is being able to work on products that change people&#8217;s lives.  I read the reviews on Amazon Echo and it’s amazing to see how customers use device, especially disabled people.  It’s pretty exciting and inspiring.</p>\n<p><b>People are speculating that technology like the Echo is the future.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes it’s very exciting to be part of that! </span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m curious to know what it was like culturally going from the Philippines to Texas, then from Texas to Silicon Valley.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Culturally, going from the Philippines to Texas was a breath of fresh air for me.  In the Philippines there was such a stigma of being a single parent.  You and your child get either judged or pitied on.  Hopefully things have changed there since then.  Regarding moving from Dallas to the Bay Area, I love the culture of learning and trying to be the best at what you do.  There are so many movements, organizations, meet ups in tech that it’s not hard for the enthusiasm to rub off on you.  I’m not saying it didn’t exist in Dallas, but maybe I just was not in that environment. </span></p>\n<p><b>What has your experience been work-wise as a single mother?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest difference for me is not being able to travel for business.  It has to be planned and I could only go if I had someone I trusted, like my parents, to look after my child.  I think that being a parent is hard whether you’re a single parent or part of a two-parent household.  As far as my daily work, when my daughter was younger, I had to force myself to be efficient because I didn&#8217;t have the luxury of staying extra hours if I didn’t manage my time well.   </span></p>\n<p><b>What&#8217;s it been like, leaving your support network in Texas, and then trying to find support networks here?  Have you found them yet?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was difficult leaving my family and friends. I’m a bit towards the introverted side, so it took effort and courage to put myself out there and make new friends.  I mentioned that my daughter is in the drum line at her school’s marching band.  Volunteering for that enabled me to meet other parents who were very welcoming.  It definitely involved getting out of my comfort zone.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I always come across difficult problems to solve at work.  But they’re almost never as bad as the difficult problems I’ve had to face in life.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Have you had any particular mentors in your career?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, in Texas I had a good manager who mentored me when I was new to QA.  I’ve also had several good managers since I moved here.  One managed me remotely from Seattle and he always talked about improving my skills thinking not just about my current company but for my future career.  I thought that was kind of refreshing. Maybe that was another one of those cultural differences back in Dallas where I didn&#8217;t feel like I could be that open with my managers about my career because if it may not line up with what is best for their team.  You have this fear of being the first to go in a layoff if they knew you had any thoughts about leaving.  Here, no one expects you to stay in one place for 10 years, or even 5 years, so you can be much more open.  </span></p>\n<p><b>It’s like to keep you, they have to nurture that.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exactly. Having a good manager is important to me, so when I interview, I make sure it goes both ways.   </span></p>\n<p><b>What do you look for in a job now compared to earlier in your career?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I look for somewhere where I can add value to team or company, in an environment that supports autonomy and creativity. It would be great to work on something that customers love, and I can say, “I worked on that!”   </span></p>\n<p><b>How do your friends and family feel about how far you&#8217;ve come?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My parents were always supportive of me and cheered me on every step forward I made.  Today, I feel that I’ve made my parents proud.   My daughter always thanks me for being a great mom.  That means a lot to me.  </span></p>\n<p><b>How do you think the combination of your background and all of your life experiences impact the way that you approach your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I always come across difficult problems to solve at work.  But they’re almost never as bad as the difficult problems I’ve had to face in life.  I also am not confused anymore about what I want to do with my career.  Getting rid of that lingering doubt helps me focus better.    </span></p>\n<p><b>Let&#8217;s go macro for a second.  How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016?  Like what is exciting to you, what frustrates you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think the Connected Home and Internet-of-Things will be big this year.  I’m excited to be part of that.  But I think it will be important for people to distinguish between the ones that improve your quality of life and others that are just innovation for innovation’s sake.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology aside, I see a lot of exciting and frustrating moments about improving diversity in tech.  Women in Tech in particular is close to my heart, having a daughter who is exploring careers and deciding what to major in.  I see a lot of movement around this and I feel hopeful.  She took Java programming this year at school to test the waters and see if she liked it enough to minor in Computer Science.  She had a good experience and now she is thinking about majoring in it.  She might still change mind of course, but my hope is for her to experience a more gender-diverse tech world than I did.   </span></p>\n<p><b>What are your goals for 2016? Either for work or for yourself.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a lot of goals.  At the start of each year, I write my goals for the year  and I like to revisit it throughout the year to see if I’m making progress.  The career goal I set for myself this year was to switch roles from a QA Engineer to a Software Development Engineer in Test.  I talked with my manager about it and I’m happy to say that I am working on that transition now.  My personal goals involve getting better at programming, reading more, traveling more, living healthier, watching more concerts, getting back into playing the drums and maybe even playing in a band! </span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in five or ten years?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would love to be a software developer and build something.  In 10 years, I’d love to be able to at the top of my industry.  I don’t know what that will look like yet.  Maybe those jobs don’t even exist yet, just like many of the tech jobs now didn’t exist 10 years ago. </span></p>\n<p><b>My last question for you would be, what advice would you have for folks that are going through some hardships, or had crazy life obstacles thrown at them and are trying to figure out their career?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have a goal, make a plan and focus on the process of getting there.  There are times when life is crazy that you don’t have the time or energy to even focus on your career.  But it’s not always going to be a hardship.  Set realistic expectations given the situation that you currently have.  For example, when the kids are young and you don’t have help, maybe all you can focus on is raising them and doing &#8220;good enough&#8221; at your job.  Accept that that’s where you are right now.  They will get more independent as they grow, and you can execute on your plan one little step at a time.  Manage your time well.  We all only have 24 hours in a day.  Figure out what’s important to you.  For me, getting 8 hours of sleep is priority.  If you feel like you never have the time or energy, try to identify and fix the unimportant things that suck up your time, or things that cause you stress.  It might be debt, health, relationship stress.  Read books and learn from other people on how to deal with these problems.  There’s no need to learn all of life’s lessons the hard way.  It makes it easier to work on your career when you can lessen or eliminate other stresses in your life.  Lastly, for parents, don’t let your life revolve around your children.  They will turn 18, graduate and be on their own. Don’t forget to treat yourself with love and kindness.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Have a goal, make a plan and focus on the process of getting there.  There are times when life is crazy that you don’t have the time or energy to even focus on your career.  But it’s not always going to be a hardship.&#8221;</p></blockquote>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b></b><b>Why don&#8217;t we start at the beginning? Tell me about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I grew up in the Midwest in a town called Waterloo, Iowa. I lived there my whole life and went to undergrad at The University of Iowa for Mechanical Engineering, then moved out to California to study Systems Engineering at UC Berkeley, where I literally knew one person (hi Scott!). I was only supposed to be here for 9 months—the length of the program—but so far I’ve been here for 9 years…whoops.</span></p>\n<p><b>Funny how that happens.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah.</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m curious what it was like being a first generation American in Iowa being raised by immigrant parents.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My parents both left Vietnam in the 70s and started out with almost nothing. As immigrants, they were always kind to others because they were just grateful to be here.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a native Iowan, I will vouch for the fact that </span><a href=\"https://www.thrillist.com/lifestyle/nation/my-life-living-midwestern-nice\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Midwesterners are very nice people</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naturally, when you combine that Midwestern niceness with being an immigrant, you get some extra nice folks. </span></p>\n<p><b>So interesting. You&#8217;re first generation college too. Did you parents expect you to go to college?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both of my parents sacrificed so much for my brother and I to go to college that it seemed like a shame not to go. Their expectations were pretty strict, both in and out of school, but any struggles I had always seemed to pale in comparison to to theirs. So what if I had homework? At least I was fortunate enough to go to school.</span></p>\n<p><b>Walk me through your time at Berkeley, and then eventually getting into tech. Did you know you would end up in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spring of 2008 was a pretty shitty time to graduate, regardless of most degrees. The economy was so bad that 1 out of 4 of people my age was unemployed, and I was one of them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting a job seemed like a bit of a pipe dream, so I moved in with my aunt in San Jose. There wasn’t any Wi-Fi at the house, so I would walk a mile every day to Barnes and Noble in the mall to look for and apply to jobs. I think I ate at every single place in the food court during that time, haha.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I applied to over 250 jobs, had a couple dozen interviews, and did a bunch of odd jobs like data entry, event promotion, and tutoring to get by. At the time, my monthly budget was $600 for rent, food, and everything else.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a year and a half, even with two engineering degrees from well-regarded universities, I didn’t receive a single job offer.</span></p>\n<p>My lucky break came when my friend’s mom wanted a new brand for her law firm. Her son connected us and I started by designing her a logo. She liked my work and we enjoyed working together so much that I ended up rebranding her website as well, based on the new logo. Her site was the first I had ever designed and built. On top of that, we developed a friendship that continues to this day.</p>\n<p><b>Awesome. So walk me through the experience of getting into tech. What happened after that first website was built, and how was that experience for you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I was working on that first website, people I met at networking events or just any casual parties would ask what I was doing, so I would say “I’m working on building a website.” A lot of people responded with “Oh that’s cool, I know someone who needs a website” or wanted one for themselves, so I got more and more clients just by word of mouth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through a friend, I found a job with a web consulting firm in San Francisco, but around the same time I started working for them part time, I also received a full time job offer at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I applied to over 250 jobs, had a couple dozen interviews, and did a bunch of odd jobs like data entry, event promotion, and tutoring to get by. At the time, my monthly budget was $600 for rent, food, and everything else. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a year and a half, even with two engineering degrees from well-regarded universities, I didn’t receive a single job offer.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>I worked the two jobs in parallel but my heart was really in web design and development, so I decided to quit the energy research job at Lawrence Berkeley and focus on what I loved doing. I remember thinking: “Am I crazy? It took me a year and a half to find a job, and now I&#8217;m leaving after five months?” Everything turned out great though, as I eventually became partner at the consulting firm and stayed for 4 years.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During that time, we built websites for governments in Indonesia, Angola and Mongolia and worked with a bunch of city planning and transit agencies all over the US, and traveled for two months out of every year for those 4 years. I would say my experience with that was really great.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, I’m a product designer at a company called Plate IQ.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The product allows restaurants to dive into how much they’re spending on purchases, sort of like what mint.com lets you do for personal finances. We let you know that last month you spent 40% of produce purchases on fancy mushrooms, or that you currently owe half a million dollars in outstanding invoices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also can automatically calculate costs for every dish on a menu, letting chefs and owners understand how each ingredient contributes to their bottom line.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an industry where the margins are already so small, this kind of data is really meaningful for our customers.</span></p>\n<p><b>Very cool. What have been the most exciting things to you about working in product design and working in tech? What is it about the work that really excites you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love product design because I like to build bridges between what a person expects and what technology is able to offer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love that I can expect zero to 2 meetings in any given day, and how I can take an idea from concept to completion in sometimes just a few days. It’s a really powerful experience being able to iterate through ideas and develop them so quickly.</span></p>\n<p><b>Has anything in tech been on the tough side?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being the only woman on a team can be tough, especially if there are 9 other guys or something, and then there’s you. Even small talk can be awkward if a guy says “I’m working from home today, the wife is sick” and doesn’t think about how that might make you, as a female, feel objectified. “The wife,” like, “the car”? If you have a name for your car, you should definitely have a name for your wife.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One time my friend got reported to HR by someone at work because her “hair flips were too sexy.” Sometimes, I’m just like, are you fucking kidding me?</span></p>\n<p><b>As someone who didn&#8217;t grow up with a ton of money, what is it like seeing Silicon Valley and being in it for so long?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s pretty crazy sometimes. I went through a phase where I enjoyed going to all these after parties, hackathons, and conferences. Every tech event had a t-shirt but none were ever made for women, so I collected a bajillion poorly fitting men’s T-shirts in the process, haha.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes I feel like everyone is patting each other on the back about how good they are at helping startups help startups help other startups, and no one is doing anything meaningful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s me being super cynical, of course. I think there are a lot of companies out here doing great work, fueled by epic rockstar developers and Red Bull. Okay, that’s me being cynical again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But seriously, startup culture can be amazing. Who honestly wants to work in a real life Office Space? If a startup can make money and provide free meals and unlimited time off and let their employees to go Vegas and Hawaii for team building, that’s awesome.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah—I remember when I first worked in tech—I called it &#8220;the underbelly&#8221;—the scene of everybody who spent all of their time partying and congratulating each other, verses the ones that weren&#8217;t at the parties because they were working on things that really meant something to them. It&#8217;s just a funny correlation to me. Another thing that resonated with me in your pre-interview was that—being raised in Iowa—you were taught to be nice, and that you had to unlearn how to be nice when you moved here, which I also went through and it was really hard.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you from the Midwest as well?</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m from North Carolina where it&#8217;s like—you&#8217;re a nice Southern girl and you say &#8220;hi, how are you&#8221; to everyone in the grocery stores. And I very quickly—I&#8217;m just a cold-hearted human compared to the way that I was when I first got here. I&#8217;m curious to hear how it changed for you for that process.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure, I actually had a friend tell me last year that I have become more condescending since he met me 9 years ago when I first moved here from Iowa, and that absolutely sucked to hear. And I could totally see how he would feel that way, and I was glad to hear it, and I really thought about it deeply because that’s not the kind of person I want to be. </span></p>\n<p><b>You also mentioned in your pre-interview that going to Hacker School changed your views on feminism. I&#8217;m so curious about that.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hacker School (now called </span><a href=\"https://www.recurse.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recurse Center</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) was one of the most inclusive working environments I have ever had the privilege of being a part of. The three months I spent in New York really changed how I felt about feminism because I had never before been part of an organization that openly said, “Sexism is not okay here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of that, the batch of Recurse Center I went to was 40% female, and it was the first time in 6 or 7 years that I was part of anything that was more than 1-5% female. If I had a question, I could ask a guy OR a girl! If I sucked at something, it wasn’t because I was a girl. </span></p>\n<p><b>That’s huge.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah.</span></p>\n<p><b>You mentioned another thing in your pre-interview about the concept of self selection, and how you&#8217;ve seen it influence hiring of people? </b><b>I&#8217;m curious to hear more of your thoughts on that.</b></p>\n<p>“Culture fit” is such a big thing here. It&#8217;s hard to even coach somebody that you think is qualified for a position at a startup on how to pass the culture fit part of an interview in the Bay Area. I would have to know what the culture was like at every single startup and have intimate knowledge of every team at that particular startup to tell you how you need to act if you want to get hired there [chuckles], which is crazy.</p>\n<p><b>I still can&#8217;t believe &#8220;culture fit&#8221; is a term that companies are allowed to use. It seems so obvious that that&#8217;s just a bias that is not a positive thing anymore.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, the problem with using “culture fit” to hire is how easily it can be used to push discriminating practices under the rug. When people have these huge time and budget constraints it’s easier to go with their gut feeling instead of thinking about the real reasons they’re rejecting a candidate. I’ve seen people go the easy route and hire all their friends first, and then everyone else later. “Culture fit” makes it hard to get your foot in the door if you don’t know someone or have an extraordinary ability to market yourself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s complicated because I can see myself hiring people just like me. But that’s what everybody else does too. But there aren’t many like me to start off with, so that’s a problem. Because now all the non-me&#8217;s are hiring people not like me.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The problem with using “culture fit” to hire is how easily it can be used to push discriminating practices under the rug.

You mentioned also, the importance of finding a champion at work.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I forgot I wrote all these things! I was like, &#8220;Was there all that space?&#8221; [laughs]</span></p>\n<p><b>You wrote a lot, but it was really good. You were throwing great stuff at me. </b></p>\n<p>Yes. I was asking people for advice because I was having trouble at one of my jobs, because I felt like nobody that worked with me was my champion. That person doesn&#8217;t have to be trumpeting everything you do, but they should at least be willing to listen to you.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My friend suggested that no matter how good you are at something, if someone opposes you personally, you might as well leave unless you want to play office politics. Honestly if you’re talented, there isn’t any reason you should have to put up with that kind of bullshit. And I mean the passive aggressive, leaving you out of important conversations, denying opportunities kind of bullshit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At one point in my career, I was told “everyone is a designer these days”, as if it were some trendy thing and I was just jumping on some bandwagon. As much as I respected this person for other reasons, he wasn’t qualified to be the gatekeeper of my career.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So after a bit of thought, I quit that job, became a designer, and haven’t regretted it since.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;My friend suggested that no matter how good you are at something, if someone opposes you personally, you might as well leave unless you want to play office politics.

And I mean the passive aggressive, leaving you out of important conversations, denying opportunities kind of bullshit.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>And undermines all of your talents and expertise. Yes, that&#8217;s frustrating. What do you look for in a job now versus when you started, what is really important to you now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I started, I was looking for anything because I was unemployed. So I took any opportunity I could get, whether that was designing a simple, static 5-page website or rolling on a Segway through an ice arena promoting HP photo printers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that I can afford to be picky, I look for problems I think are interesting to solve, and for people who respect me. I think being respected at work is huge and sometimes feels like a luxury, even though it shouldn’t be.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also look for good listeners. I used to have a manager who would always say “I understand,” but as a way of cutting you off instead of letting you know that he actually understood. I know others who say the same thing, but you can tell they actually listened because they follow up with a relevant comment or question.</span></p>\n<p><b>Big difference.</b></p>\n<p>Yeah.</p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m so curious, how do you think that your background and the culmination of your life experiences affect how you approach your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hmm. In the beginning I was just grateful for everything that was offered. I never negotiated for more money whenever I had a job just because I was just thankful, but later on I was chatting with a friend and he said he struggled with the same thing because he grew up poor as well. And he said he came to this realization that it’s not wrong to want to grow in order to reach your potential. Why should anyone ever feel sorry about that?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I used to say I was interested in design, and I was interested in working as a designer, but most responses to that had an undertone of, “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh that’s cute, you’re interested in design. Too bad you’re not a real designer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It took me a long time to realize that I wasn’t hurting anyone by being honest instead of modest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So now I say: “I am good at what I do. I would love to work with you.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;In the beginning I was just grateful for everything that was offered. I never negotiated for more money whenever I had a job just because I was just thankful, but later on I was chatting with a friend and he said he struggled with the same thing because he grew up poor as well.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>My last question for you would be, what are some of the biggest lessons that you&#8217;ve learned that you would give to folks that come from similar backgrounds? What advice would you give to folks that are hoping to get into tech but may not feel like they can?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re still in school, you have SO much time to figure it all out. The technologies and tools will change by the time you graduate anyway, so just focus on learning the fundamentals and building friendships and relationships.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be genuine, be generous, and tactful. I have never regretted being nice to someone. Rather, my most difficult friendships and relationships were often because I took someone’s generosity for granted or was nasty to the other person for no good reason.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be thoughtful about your decisions so when there comes a point where you thought you had your dream job and then 6 months in, all you want to do is quit, it’s a decision rather than a reaction. And believe me, this will happen. Startups are crazy like that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s not really one single thing that you can take to heart that will grant you success in every endeavor, but I do think it’s important to ask yourself what you want to achieve. And what is worth giving up to have that?</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

It wasn’t that I didn’t want to socialize, I just couldn’t seem to figure out how to do it. Or how everyone else was doing it.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I went to a small private elementary school, there were about 35 kids in my whole grade, and everyone there was nice, like there wasn’t any bullying or anything, but it was just an incredibly homogeneous school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got this label of being the “smart kid.” But the reason people thought I was smart was because I got good grades. And also because I had started kindergarten early, ‘cause I started reading really young, so I was a year younger than everyone in my class. When you’re like 8 years old, that one year makes a big difference. And I didn’t think getting good grades was interesting at all, and reading was just like, something that happened. Like </span>I literally found a book on the side of the road and I took it home and it was this book of animal poems and that’s how I learned to read.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Getting good grades was just what was expected of me by my parents, you get straight A’s in school, like that’s what you do. I didn’t feel intellectually challenged in school at all. And so I kind of hated that label, I hated being “the smart kid,” it was like because I got good grades in school, that was all anybody knew me for. Because everybody gets a label, right. There was one girl who liked to draw, so she was the “artsy kid.” But if you were the “smart kid” you couldn’t also be the “artsy kid” because you can only have one label at a time. And I hated being reduced to something so one-dimensional just because I’d done what was expected of me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I found a lot of the people and the kind of stimulation I was looking for online. We got AOL when I was 8, and I would play a lot of RPGs through chat rooms and mailing lists on there.</span> I loved MUDs, which are these text-based RPGs, no visuals, everything is a written description.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> They’re still my favorite kind of game. Especially the smaller ones, where the people who made the game were just other characters you hang out with in the game, and there was such a strong sense of community that was built by the players themselves, not handed to you by some big game company or whatever, and the makers were always building new areas for you to explore and doing silly things, because it was just text, right, so it was easy to make more stuff. But </span>those games became my world, like my whole social world.</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;We got AOL when I was 8, and I would play a lot of RPGs through chat rooms and mailing lists on there.</span> I loved MUDs, which are these text-based RPGs, no visuals, everything is a written description. Those games became my world, like my whole social world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>I’m really old school about games, I like where people just sort of agree on a set of rules and then the rest is left to your imagination. I love how you can turn those worlds into anything you want. I think at some point in real life, like way into my adult life, I realized “fuck it,” like you can do that in real life too. Everything is malleable. It’s this really beautiful thing, like games are actually just reality and vice versa.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I kind of stopped playing games in high school but then I ended up spending a lot of time on random online forums and making friends on there. It was the same sort of thing where you had to figure out all these social norms and learn how to make friends and politic a bit. </span>And that felt more natural to me, reading and typing and making friends that way, than doing it in real life, where in real life people kind of look at you and tell you who you are based on something that’s sort of out of your control.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Like I didn’t know my dad had an accent until I was in junior high. I didn’t know I didn’t look white until somebody told me. I didn’t know I was like, a woman, until I started getting that kind of attention.</span></p>\n<p>I think I just got along better with people online because nobody knew who anyone was in real life and it didn’t really matter. Like I was in this guild for awhile and they finally figured out I was 9 years old and then it got awkward. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a big deal if you even knew someone’s first name in real life instead of their character name or username. I mean this was all pre-Facebook or whatever. And I remember people would have, like, one photo they would upload to the game website and be like “This is me! This is what I look like!” So yeah it was just very detached from the real world and I liked that I could just be me and not be this flat “smart kid” character, where like, any time you had an original thought people were like “oh, it’s ‘cause she’s smart!” which seemed incredibly reductive and boring and not interesting to me in real life.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think I just got along better with people online because nobody knew who anyone was in real life and it didn’t really matter. Like I was in this guild for awhile and they finally figured out I was 9 years old and then it got awkward.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway. So then I went to a Quaker high school, which was super impactful in the way I was brought up. It was much more challenging and interesting. It just kind of like—it just gave me really good framework on the rest of life. Quakers are sort of like the hippy branch of Christians that are all about equality, and everything was about sitting in a circle and talking out your feelings. They believe everyone has this same sort of “that of God” inside them, everyone has something worth sharing, and that’s what brings us together. So it was just really influential for me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&#8217;s see, what else? My dad is Persian, but he grew up in Germany, and my mom is Chinese-Indonesian, but she grew up in Indonesia. I was in suburban Pennsylvania so there was a lot of culture mixing and everything. My mom lived in Indonesia when I was younger and my dad was in Pennsylvania. </span>I spent a lot of time in Indonesia and a lot of time in Pennsylvania. I&#8217;ve always just kind of felt in between everything. Everything is kind of the same, it&#8217;s all a matter of perspective and I think that&#8217;s carried with me throughout the rest of my life.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went to college at Tufts in Boston, came out of college, wanted to move to San Francisco because it was warm and different. I had been on the East Coast—North East—my whole life. San Francisco was like a whole other world for me. Being in a super suburban environment was—I just kind of felt like I never really belonged. It was not a great place for creativity to thrive. I even felt like being in Boston or D.C. or wherever, there was just such an East Coast way of doing things, and on the West Coast it was like, &#8220;Be free! Be yourself, whatever.&#8221; </span>I was really overwhelmed when I first moved to San Francisco because I was like ,&#8221;Oh my god! There are other people my age that are doing things that are crazier than me, and like, how did I miss out on this? My life is over. I&#8217;m 21.” <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not true, of course—and I sort of learned to get into the flow and the balance of things. Everyone here is so, so introspective and there is always something you can fix and change about yourself. And that appeals to such a big part of my brain and is very exciting. But then, I think especially in recent years it&#8217;s kind of been around managing, like, alright, there&#8217;s a point where you can be happy and where you can decide what you do and you don&#8217;t want to do. So, yeah.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was really overwhelmed when I first moved to San Francisco because I was like ,&#8217;Oh my god! There are other people my age that are doing things that are crazier than me, and like, how did I miss out on this? My life is over. I&#8217;m 21.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>When did you first get interested in tech as a career?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kind of by accident. So I was—I thought I was going to go into environmental policy after Tufts. And then I ended up doing stuff around impact investing and working with foundations and university endowments to invest their money into more socially conscious things. That ended up giving me a little bit of a detour. I ended up going to San Francisco and working with a strategy consulting firm that specialized in nonprofits. And so I got placed with an education nonprofit. And that education nonprofit happened to also be a website—it was called GreatSchools. And so they provide free K to 12 data for parents and teachers and students and whatever to help them choose a school. I just thought that was really cool because they were just offering this information for free. They were just doing it because they thought it made sense. That was my first introduction to technology, through the nonprofit site. I saw technology as kind of a way to influence ideas more quickly than I was able to in nonprofit roles. I still felt like I had the same sort of goals and objectives as I did in nonprofit world. There are a lot of things that are so slow-moving when it comes to nonprofits, and with tech it’s just like, &#8220;You have an idea? You can get implemented. You can do it.&#8221; So that really appealed to me.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Sometimes I feel like playing around in venture, and sometimes I feel like playing around in startups or whatever. But I want to be wherever the best place is for ideas to happen.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Walk me through your next steps. You&#8217;ve done entrepreneurship. You ended up in VC. You&#8217;re working in open source world. Walk me through all of that.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t really know how I ended up doing all sort of different things [chuckles]. I think after being at the education nonprofit, I left to start a company with my roommate at the time, because that&#8217;s what you do. It was sort of like me wanting to try my hand at something fun. I don&#8217;t think there is really anything deeper to it. I was learning how to code at the time and teaching myself how to code. It was fun and we kind of made something. I was super inexperienced. I remember when we made the website. I was like, “I think I can put a website together, maybe,” and my co-founder was like, &#8220;Sure. Whatever.&#8221; So it was just kind of like a fun project for us, that started growing into a business. And that was really exciting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We went through the 500 Startups accelerator. We went into raising money, and kind of seeing how well-supported startups and venture were—and how well the ecosystem works. Basically, if you have an idea, there&#8217;s going to be capital out there to support you. No one is saying that startups don&#8217;t get funded enough. I think, fundamentally, it was just really creatively enabling to realize that you can do that. I kind of wanted to be able to provide that to other people too, right?</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I love the idea of being able to enable other people to be creative. I love the, just the idea of helping people be the most &#8216;them&#8217; that they are, and just pulling out whatever is unique and special about people and really encouraging it. And so funding can be a really great mechanism for that because you&#8217;re enabling somebody to do something.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So being on the venture side afterwards—we ended up selling our company to a food brand—because we realized cooking was not our lifelong passion. But it was fun. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I ended up joining this venture capital firm. It was a lot of fun. I just started feeling really sucked into [chuckles] the machine of it all. And that&#8217;s not a knock against funders, it&#8217;s not even a knock against venture capital. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I’ve moved around a lot of different sectors because I actually didn&#8217;t really grow up thinking of myself as a creative person, but now people keep telling me I am, so maybe I am. In just the sense of I kind of want to do whatever I feel like doing. And so </span>sometimes I feel like playing around in venture, and sometimes I feel like playing around in startups or whatever. But I want to be wherever the best place is for ideas to happen. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And I felt like, with venture—and I think that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been drawn to the funding side, even with impact investing stuff before.</span> I love the idea of being able to enable other people to be creative. I love the, just the idea of helping people be the most “them” that they are, and just pulling out whatever is unique and special about people and really encouraging it. And so funding can be a really great mechanism for that because you&#8217;re enabling somebody to do something. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, I think they&#8217;re—it sounds like that on paper with venture, but it doesn&#8217;t always work out that way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And right now, working in open source and basically I&#8217;m trying to help people understand a lot of the risks and problems in supporting open source infrastructure right now. And the best part about it right now is being able to work with really, really creative people all the time. I love hearing people’s crazy stories. I love hearing how they&#8217;ve had to grapple with other people. </span>I think the coolest thing about open source right now is that it is just—it all comes down to community and working with people and there&#8217;s nothing you can really automate about it, it would just never work. So you have to learn how to talk to people, you have to learn how to get along with lots of people and make it all come together somehow. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I feel really happy just being around creativity and feeling enabled and validated and all that.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think the coolest thing about open source right now is that it is just—it all comes down to community and working with people and there&#8217;s nothing you can really automate about it, it would just never work.

Tell me more about what it was like being a lady entrepreneur. Being part of that world, fundraising, eventually selling. What was that experience like?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wasn’t doing most of the fundraising so that made that part easier. [laughter] It was actually kind of funny. </span>I was the person building the products and people would always go, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re a female coder!&#8221; or whatever, which was sort of funny, but I guess worked to our advantage because it was a positive expectation for people. The thing that bothered me about being a founder was that if I told people that we had a food company, they would always assume my co-founder was female and they would just be like, &#8220;Oh, women, food. Makes perfect sense. Women do fashion companies and food companies and stuff,<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8221; and I never thought of myself as that—it was just something that we wanted to do at the time and it was just like, &#8220;You&#8217;re my roommate,&#8221; you know.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was the person building the products and people would always go, &#8216;Oh, you&#8217;re a female coder!&#8217; or whatever, which was sort of funny, but I guess worked to our advantage because it was a positive expectation for people.

Women do fashion companies and food companies and stuff.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;&#8216;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I felt like I was being forced into some sort of weird stereotype that I didn&#8217;t really identify with. Yeah, actually, I really love cooking, personally. I still do, but it doesn&#8217;t make me womanly, that I like to cook. There are plenty of guys who like to cook. It was just this weird pushback against my gender. </span>The same thing happened in venture, where everyone calls you a woman VC. I was like, I don&#8217;t want to be a woman VC. I just want to be an investor, like anybody else.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It definitely has its advantages. I have no way of proving this, but I felt like it was easier for people to open up to women in a one-on-one conversation. At least, I found that I would learn things very quickly, like really personal stories, about founders that I talked to. That was cool. Then on the other hand, there would be boundary crossing with other investors in other firms, or with founders I talked to, where it suddenly gets a little too close, and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to manage this.&#8221; </span>I feel like there&#8217;s always this adjective being attached to everything I&#8217;m doing, that&#8217;s like, &#8220;You&#8217;re the female.&#8221; Like, &#8220;So cool. You&#8217;re a woman.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yep, I&#8217;m a woman. I don&#8217;t really know what else you want me to say.&#8221; I only want to do things that feel really natural to me, so this stuff feels really natural, and so that&#8217;s why I do it. It feels awkward when somebody retroactively puts this adjective on me that I don&#8217;t even feel like I identify that strongly with.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be a woman VC. I just want to be an investor, like anybody else.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>You brought up that you downplay your gender in the workplace, which I could totally relate to when I worked in tech. I am so much more feminine—I&#8217;m still not super-feminine, but I&#8217;m so much more feminine now as a photographer who works for myself than when I was in tech. </b></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s odd because sometimes I don&#8217;t know whether I feel like I don&#8217;t identify that strongly with the woman label because identifying with it would downplay my own power and influence, or whether because I truly don&#8217;t identify with it. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So it&#8217;s like a really odd thing to manage. I make a point to wear basically the same thing all the time.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s odd because sometimes I don&#8217;t know whether I feel like I don&#8217;t identify that strongly with the woman label because identifying with it would downplay my own power and influence, or whether because I truly don&#8217;t identify with it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>All black? Yeah me too. [laughter]</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just dress down, like don&#8217;t wear anything that&#8217;s too form-fitting, err on the side of pants and sneakers and stuff. People joke around with me about it. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Honestly it makes a difference.&#8221; It makes me feel like when I talk to people they&#8217;re at least not looking at my body or something. It&#8217;s sort of weird that we have to do it. But </span>I hate being looked at. I think that’s why I prefer writing to speaking, honestly. Or just being behind a screen. Because then I feel like people are paying attention to my ideas instead of my face or what I’m wearing or whatever.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I hate being looked at.

But definitely a lot of the—I&#8217;m standing in the circle with a bunch of people, and all the guys get asked what they do, and the woman is just assumed to be, &#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s probably someone&#8217;s girlfriend.&#8221; Even if the conversation is highly relevant to what I&#8217;m doing, I jump in and make comments about the ideas like anyone else would. And they kind of just look at you like, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s cute,&#8221; and keep talking. The most validating time, I have to say, to have this happen was being in VC. Because </span>when you say the word VC, the mic drops and everybody&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh my God, you have money.&#8221; Which I thought was just funny because people&#8217;s tones would just change completely when they realize that. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yep. You probably shouldn&#8217;t do that.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m standing in the circle with a bunch of people, and all the guys get asked what they do, and the woman is just assumed to be, &#8216;Oh, she&#8217;s probably someone&#8217;s girlfriend.&#8217; Even if the conversation is highly relevant to what I&#8217;m doing, I jump in and make comments about the ideas like anyone else would.

My story changes a little bit every time, because it honestly was a lot of different reasons. I think that, honestly, I was feeling a little bit burned out by venture. It was truly the most fun and the most hard job I&#8217;ve had so far, but after I left I really thought about, &#8220;Do I even want to be in tech any more? Like, I should just go.&#8221; Like, &#8220;Fuck this place.&#8221; And really thought about moving out of San Francisco. Really thought about whether I just want to do something completely different. And even experimented and talked to people about it and really gave it some serious exploration, and in the end I realized, &#8220;I actually love technology.&#8221; Like, </span>there&#8217;s a reason why I came into this sector. I really, really, really, really love it. I could not picture myself anywhere else. And that comes with all these other strings attached, but I love being here. And so I kind of had to find, &#8220;What is it that I still love about it that can make me happy?&#8221; And I realized that chasing after the next unicorn or trying to get into the next hot deal is just not fulfilling for me.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And I think it required a lot of mental adjustment, too, because you get told—when you&#8217;re in the startup-venture binary—being in venture is like you hold the purse strings; you have all this cachet and people invite you to things and people think you&#8217;re important and whatever, and so you get this false sense of status which is kind of ridiculous. And it felt weird to be like, “Why don&#8217;t I want this”, or like “Why doesn&#8217;t this make me happy?” It took awhile to just let that go and say this is not where I want to be and if I do this I&#8217;m going to be really unhappy and I want to be around things that make me happy and so it just started with like, &#8220;What can I do that makes me happy?'&#8221; and like “Where do I want to be?&#8221; and that&#8217;s how I ended up here because once I started talking to people in the open source world, I just felt really happy. I felt really at home. I felt like people understood me and my mindset and I wasn&#8217;t feeling like I had to defend this core sense of identity all the time so, yeah, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a reason why I came into this sector.

I still feel like I have great friends in the industry. I just felt fundamentally not like me, which was like this gut feeling. I felt like there were constantly people around me telling me I had to be a certain way that I wasn&#8217;t and I guess I actually didn&#8217;t really realize how feminine my outlook is, if you can call it feminine. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In VC for example, people talk about, “Are there enough women in venture”, and they talk about discrimination. I actually don&#8217;t think the discrimination is that obvious. It&#8217;s not really about, did someone make a sexist remark at you or something, but it&#8217;s more of, I feel like my point of view was just not compatible with venture. Where venture is highly, highly competitive, and it&#8217;s about bravado, and I don&#8217;t know, just posturing, being something you&#8217;re not, whatever. And this is true with founders too, I think. I&#8217;m super, super cooperative, I like finding ways to bring everyone together, and let&#8217;s work towards a solution. I&#8217;m really inspired by multiple sectors, and how do nonprofits and for- profits work together. Like venture and foundations. And so I love just thinking across a lot of different things, and I felt like that was just not a point of view that was appreciated. Even with startups, it&#8217;s like, “execute execute,” “hustle hustle.” And then just, aaahh, I just want to—it was so binary for me to think that way, and I think very fluidly. And there&#8217;s trade-offs for both, but it&#8217;s just I think I felt burnt out over time, because I felt I was being forced to be this binary supercharged hustler. It&#8217;s like, “That is not who I am, and is that okay world, if I&#8217;m not?”</span></p>\n<p><b>Did you have early support networks when you came here, and where do you find those now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, that&#8217;s a good question. Nobody has asked me that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did not really know anybody when I moved here. I had one friend from Tufts who I didn&#8217;t know super well but we&#8217;re now really close friends. I had a couple people that I knew through this fellowship that I was doing when I moved out here, and cobbled together a friend network from that. Those people ended up becoming my closest friends, so I felt supported in that way. And my partner, who’s my biggest source of support and positive influence in my life, he came out of that circle of friends, too. </span></p>\n<p>In terms of support network for tech, it happened slowly and over time. I&#8217;m trying to think back. There were a couple people that were really, really useful and supportive early on. Literally, a couple<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Anything I knew that I wanted to do, probably came from popping into a network of sorts. When I learned how to code, there weren’t a whole lot of bootcamps or courses. It was still a fairly opaque process. I joined the Women Who Code group in the meetup here, and it just gave me such a safe space to do something that was so intimidating. I&#8217;m so thankful for Women Who Code. Just having people around you who are willing to be helpful, and sharing resources, that was just very helpful, to tap into something where by tapping into one thing, you&#8217;re connected to a whole bunch more stuff. Then with being a founder, 500 Startups helped tap into a certain network as well. I think that&#8217;s probably the benefit of accelerators for a lot of people. It’s like, &#8220;Oh, now you&#8217;re part of this network and part of this family,&#8221; or whatever. Then with doing VC, I think being at a fund that already had a great reputation was so, so helpful. People would just be like, &#8220;Oh, I know your partner,&#8221; or, &#8220;I know your investments.&#8221; And like, &#8220;You guys are a great fund,&#8221; and whatever. That&#8217;s like the ultimate tapping into a network. VCs are everywhere. That probably expanded my network the most. </span></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve never been great at asking people for individual support, like one-on-one support. People will make fun of me for it. I kind of suck at finding mentors and whatever. But I just try to be nice and make friends. Trying to give as much as I can is—I know it sounds like everybody says it, but—when you do that a little bit, it ends up coming back and helping you. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I just try to take a really—and there have been some friends of mine who have really influenced my thinking on that, of just being like, &#8220;Give, give, give! Be super, super, super fucking nice,&#8221; and like, &#8220;Never give anybody a reason to hate you.&#8221; That works really well. I guess I never really thought of myself as a super social person or like a networky kind of person. I think of myself as actually sort of antisocial, but then all my friends are always like, “You are the most calendered antisocial person I know.” So, I don&#8217;t know. It sort of happens, I guess. I try to be nice and friendly, and stuff just sort of comes my way that way. I wish I were better at asking for help though.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been great at asking people for individual support, like one-on-one support.

You can probably relate. I had no money or power in tech, so my currency was social. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, totally.</span></p>\n<p><b>I would intro people to people, or I do favors for people, or whatever. I would do anything for people because it was free, and that&#8217;s like literally how I built my value in tech</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s actually a funny mindset. I used to, like, literally—“I will help you with whatever, just let me help you.” Now I have to think about, “All right, what do I actually need to say no to, to manage my time better”, and it&#8217;s been a funny mindset to transition out of, or like, scale out of. Because I really want to be helpful to everyone. But, oh yeah, I can&#8217;t just go and do 20 different projects. I need to do the one that I want to do. But I think it&#8217;s like—it has felt that easy to just sort of be helpful wherever I can. But to look back at it, I feel like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how all that worked out.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, if you haven&#8217;t read <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown/dp/0804137382\">Essentialism</a> yet, it&#8217;s probably a good time in your life to read it.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oooh.</span></p>\n<p><b>It talks about the paradox of success and how we became successful because we had this vision, and we work super, super hard and we&#8217;re opportunistic. So you get to this level of success and then you suddenly have a million inbound options and opportunities to choose from. You have people who want to work with you, people who have cool projects for you, job offers, people who want to get coffee with you. An you&#8217;re an opportunistic person, and you want to be helpful so you want to do all those things, but then you end up stuck at this plateau because you&#8217;re busy, your energy&#8217;s now distributed towards addressing all of these options and opportunities and then you forget what you&#8217;re even going for in the first place. It&#8217;s a great book, would recommend.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That actually describes my life right now. I need to read this.</span></p>\n<p><b>I always have a copy at my house, so when you come and take your picture I&#8217;m probably just going to send it away with you.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yay. [chuckle]</span></p>\n<p><b>What are your biggest motivators? What drives you?</b></p>\n<p>What drives me? I really believe strongly on the power of creativity in individuals and to unlock that underlying ability. I know that&#8217;s super cheesy but it&#8217;s just so true. When I think about everything even in my personal life, like my personal interests, friendships, relationships, everything—it&#8217;s all about enabling some personal weirdness about myself and other people. If people feel like they can&#8217;t be really them, how can we make it so that people feel comfortable? I love one-on-one conversations with people because it&#8217;s just a matter of kinda drawing all their stories and, how do you do that to hopefully get them to open up? It makes me happier than anything else in the world. I&#8217;m very story driven. I just love hearing things that are different about other people, getting other people&#8217;s perspectives. Its why I love doing what I&#8217;m doing right now, because it&#8217;s tons of weird stories and you have to talk to people and earn their trust and then they might open up to you. Everything I do, I want it to be around that.</p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s awesome. It’s like what I tweeted like a week ago or something. &#8220;There are extroverts and introverts, but there&#8217;s need to be a word for people who get their energy exclusively from one-on-ones.&#8221;</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes.</span></p>\n<p><b>I am that person [chuckle].</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s a word that&#8217;s really hard to scale a time to, because I love meeting people even if it&#8217;s somebody that in the end there&#8217;s no real way for us to work together or whatever. I just love sitting there and listening to them. Like, &#8220;That&#8217;s awesome, tell me more” [chuckle]</span></p>\n<p><b>How do your friends and family at home feel about the work that you&#8217;ve done?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mom has been actually super awesome and supportive. Both my parents have been really supportive. I wouldn&#8217;t have thought they were going to be when I first graduated and everything. My dad is always super, super encouraging—motivating me to &#8220;do what you need to do.&#8221; He&#8217;s always supported all my weird travel adventures and everything. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I remember when I first told them I wanted to start a company with my roommate. They didn&#8217;t know what was going to happen, but they were so, so, so supportive. Then I went to VC and they were really supportive. They&#8217;ll send me articles, right, because they&#8217;re my parents. The articles will change depending on whatever I&#8217;m doing and they&#8217;re researching all the time, which is so nice of them. My mom—when I told her I wanted to do open source stuff she&#8217;s like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what this is, but I&#8217;m reading about it all the time.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Oh my God. You&#8217;re reading about open source? What? Do you even—even my friends here don&#8217;t know what it is.&#8221; It&#8217;s been really, really awesome to have that level of support from my parents. And with friends—</span>I think the friends I keep over time are friends who understand my kookiness a little bit. Even within tech and stuff. So they&#8217;ve all been really great and supportive. I think that&#8217;s one of the most important things is: just having people around you who believe in you.</p>\n<p><b>Yeah, for sure. How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? What excites you, even particularly in open source? What frustrates you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m so curious what is going to happen in the future [chuckles]. Everyone is obviously talking about—I don&#8217;t want to say the word, but—bubbles. But it&#8217;s kind of funny, so the short time that I was in venture, was apparently, now looking at the charts, one of the peak times in spending, so no wonder I thought it was fucking nuts, and last quarter, spending dropped like crazy. So, I can&#8217;t tell from the outside necessarily what is going on, but my friends I&#8217;ve talked to have said yeah, we&#8217;re investing way less, we&#8217;re examining things a lot more carefully, and so it&#8217;s kind of like, man, I wonder what it&#8217;s like to be in venture now. So, yeah, but I think, my theory is, </span>it&#8217;s very hard to think long term about an industry that has a short history. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My theory is the world has periods of high high growth and periods of figuring out how to sustain that growth, like grappling with whatever we&#8217;ve done. And so maybe right now we&#8217;ve passed through the hyper hyper growth periods and now we&#8217;re thinking about how to sustain things, and so, I mean, there&#8217;s plenty of politics around all this stuff, but there&#8217;s more talk about nonprofits and funding long term research and partnerships and initiatives that are reaching across certain sectors, and we&#8217;re talking about basic income and it&#8217;s not a joke anymore. That&#8217;s so cool.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very hard to think long term about an industry that has a short history.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m really excited about maybe potentially we&#8217;re entering this time where people are thinking a little bit more around sustainability and ensuring these long-term things are around, that we can help fund creativity. I feel like creativity itself has been so validated as the power of the individual to make significant contributions which is why stuff like basic income doesn&#8217;t seem crazy. I mean it should be crazy. I think it&#8217;s just so funny that people are into basic income because other things sound like socialism or communism to them but then it’s like, &#8220;Oh, no, basic income is great,&#8221; and it&#8217;s partially because we believe in people. I think it&#8217;s a really cool time right now because that&#8217;s what I believe and I really hope that more people invest in it and care about it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The one thing that bothers me right now or feels weird is just all politics and conversations getting more polarized than it was before, and I&#8217;ve definitely noticed this about diversity conversations in tech, where I can&#8217;t even take part in them. It&#8217;s just really frustrating because </span>I think that there’s two philosophies around diversity. One is around hyper-polarization and separation into different shells, like, &#8220;I&#8217;m black and you&#8217;re not,&#8221; or, &#8220;I&#8217;m a woman and you&#8217;re not. You can&#8217;t understand me. You can&#8217;t possibly understand me.&#8221; That&#8217;s one school of thought and the other school of thought is more around things like unconscious bias where it&#8217;s like, &#8220;We&#8217;re all sexist. We&#8217;re all racist.&#8221;  We&#8217;re all scared and vulnerable and know what it feels like to be rejected on whatever level, and so use that as a uniting, empathic connection. Obviously, I resonate more strongly with that camp, and I feel like it’s missing from the conversation around diversity, because diversity can be all about highlighting what makes you different from others, or it could be all about highlighting what&#8217;s common between us. I really hope that is part of the conversation. I’m not very optimistic that it is and that makes me kind of sad.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think that there’s two philosophies around diversity.

I just believe that positive communication is the key to everything. Or people just being able to trust each other and be vulnerable with each other is the key to everything. I think that maybe is why building support networks and stuff doesn&#8217;t feel unusual to me, because it is just a natural part of that—of building trust with somebody else. You honor them and their willingness to trust you, and you expect likewise. I think that&#8217;s just a really powerful currency and a way of just communicating with people and making people happy. It&#8217;s the most, most important thing of anything I do with work. Making sure that I have other people&#8217;s trust and confidence and that I don&#8217;t ever violate that. That people feel welcome and included and no one ever feels shitty because I think those emotions are so universal. </span>Everything we do can kind of be boiled down to, &#8220;Do I feel shitty and rejected for who I am, or not?&#8221; I&#8217;ve felt that in so many different ways growing up and I never want to inflict that on anybody else.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Everything we do can kind of be boiled down to, &#8216;Do I feel shitty and rejected for who I am, or not?&#8217; I&#8217;ve felt that in so many different ways growing up and I never want to inflict that on anybody else.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Sounds like a very good quality for a founder or VC to have.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, or a person.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in five to ten years? Do you think you&#8217;ll still be here?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe. It&#8217;s hard to plan that far ahead. I&#8217;d like to be a little more flexible, and travel. But this still feels like my home for sure. I don&#8217;t know. I really suck at thinking far ahead for anything. [chuckles] I kind of just think ahead to like the next year. As long as my bills get paid, and I&#8217;m having fun every day, then I know I&#8217;m in a good place.</span></p>\n<p><b>What about this year? What are you like working on either yourself or for work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now it&#8217;s kind of a funny—I never really know how to explain what I&#8217;m doing right now, because I&#8217;m basically being supported by a foundation to bring more transparency to an issue that&#8217;s really important to technology. So I see sort of like the first half of this year just kind of being around getting people together, getting them talking, writing about open source so that it’s accessible. That helps bring some of those stories out of just within their communities and more to other people who might not have heard them. So that&#8217;s like a really important part of it. The reaction has been so much stronger than I expected. That&#8217;s a really positive thing. I feel like now it&#8217;s kind of time to also start thinking towards how can I help support that stuff long-term. So thinking through like what would an organization look like that can help support and sustain, or just be a resource to people in those communities who need support or need help and there’s nowhere really like that right now. I think that&#8217;s the fun part that happens next as people get excited and engaged. The question is, &#8220;What do we actually do about it?&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><b>The last question: What advice would you have for people from similar backgrounds who are hoping to get into tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;d say, &#8220;People are just your best resource.&#8221; I think that&#8217;s especially true in tech. And it&#8217;s especially true in Silicon Valley tech more than anywhere else.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where people are just so willing to help in this industry maybe more than anywhere else. I haven&#8217;t worked much in other industries but it just seems like it here. </span>So if you don&#8217;t know how to do something or you want to learn how to do something, just cold email people and say hey. Or go attend an event and introduce yourself to people. Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for help and then also give as freely as you receive.

I have three sisters. I come from very old-fashioned Italian background. I wasn&#8217;t encouraged to do a lot in terms of career. It&#8217;s kind of the mindset that you get married, you have kids, you stay home or get a small job, but your husband has the main job role. That&#8217;s what you do. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I ended up going down a path that wasn&#8217;t necessarily… I guess the word I&#8217;m looking for is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fulfilling</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I got married at twenty-three, had my son at twenty-five, and became an aesthetician. Though I was grateful for my job, it was not stimulating, and financially, it was not fulfilling. I wanted to also be an inspiration for my son. How could I tell him to do all these things, like learn how to code and that tech was the future, when I wasn&#8217;t going down that path myself?</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I got married at twenty-three, had my son at twenty-five, and became an aesthetician.

I majored in Communications, since I knew I was good at that, even though I knew I wanted to do so much more. I started taking classes through the University of Massachusetts. I did all my classes online, and after I accumulated enough credits, I was accepted into the bachelor program. I looked at the program and realized this would take me years to complete. As a mother in her mid-thirties, I didn’t have the luxury of time that someone in their early twenties may have. I needed to figure out a different path. I started looking into internships, and found an internship with a PR company. The woman who hired me was named Xinea. Through her, I was exposed to tech startups and Bitcoin. I worked with her for a few months, and then I got a call from Facebook. I interviewed, but did not expect to actually get the job offer. Surprisingly, they offered me a position with the Ads department. It just seemed like everything I was aiming for just kept happening—which, I don&#8217;t how that happened, but it worked out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Facebook, I worked on a tool that enables you to customize what kind of ads come into your feed. While I was there I took advantage of many of the programs they offered to their employees: They offered some free coding programs, like a PHP coding program for just women. It was my first experience even using the command line. I didn’t even know what Terminal was, let alone PHP or Python. Being able to see that you can manipulate or create tools using these languages was just very exciting. I eventually looked into different coding boot camps. I looked into Hackbright, an all-coding female boot camp. I attempted to start my application, and then I stopped; I saw the acceptance rate was about four percent. Because I thought, &#8221;I&#8217;m a parent, I&#8217;m a wife, I&#8217;m in my thirties. I have no business doing this. I don&#8217;t know anything technical to be able to say that I want to be a software engineer.” I put that on hold for about a year. I started looking outside of Facebook for jobs, because I was really interested in engineering, but also more of the security aspect of it. I found a job with WhiteHat Security; the position was in marketing, which is fine. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I still felt like there was a part of the tech world that I wanted to be in, but I didn&#8217;t feel that I had that traditional background to get there. I didn&#8217;t go to a major big-name school; I didn&#8217;t have a computer science degree; I was in my later thirties; and I had children. It just seemed like everything that was supposed to have already happened, I missed out on. I talked to my husband, who was very supportive. He&#8217;s a self-taught security professional and one of the most intelligent people I know. He helped when I felt like giving up. He encouraged me to apply for Hackbright. He kept me going.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I attempted to start my application, and then I stopped; I saw the acceptance rate was about four percent.

I received a email that said I was not accepted and to try again in six months. I just felt that if I lost this opportunity, I would lose it forever. This was my moment. I wrote them an email and I said, &#8220;I was so nervous on my interview, I did not represent myself in a way that truly conveyed who I am. Please give me another chance.” They wrote me back, and they said, &#8220;We have never allowed anyone to re-do an interview. But your email was so encouraging that we are going to allow you to interview again.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My second interview was much better and I was accepted! Once I started my cohort, I still felt a little bit like a fish out of water, but it was understanding the technology and understanding what it is that they teach women that don&#8217;t know anything about software development. You can come in to Hackbright with a background in tech, or you can come in knowing nothing. That&#8217;s basically where I came in, I was starting from the ground up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After I graduated, I went through many interviews. I was going through multiple software engineering position interviews, but I still felt that I wanted to to pursue security. I found an opening at Lending Club and it was through a network of people I knew. They offered me a position on the Application Security team. Now, two weeks into it, I am an Application Security Engineer. I was an aesthetician [laughs]. It&#8217;s so random and exciting.</span></p>\n<p><b>Tell me more about the challenges of getting to this point—like you commuted four hours a day. What were some of the challenges of this experience, and the hardships that you had to overcome?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had mentioned before that when I first started becoming interested in learning how to code, I had a very limited technical background. I was not a IT or Comp. Sci major that decided, “Oh, I think I want to be a software engineer.” I started asking some of the engineers at Facebook about how I can learn how to code and what is it like to have that job. The one engineer who would sit next to me was very encouraging. He would say, “It takes a lot of practice” and offer to show me how he fixes bugs in the code. Not everyone is that encouraging or helpful unfortunately. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We had an event at Facebook, and it was an Ads event to teach people in other departments what the Ads team does. The event had a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Game of Thrones</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> theme, which I was very excited about. I remember talking to someone from another team. I wanted to ask about the code but was slightly intimidated since I was very new to the world of code. So I got the courage and I said, &#8220;So what code does this code run on?&#8221; And there was a female engineer there and she turned to me and she just laughed in my face. She just laughed at me because I wasn&#8217;t part of that group, I was not an engineer, and obviously a noob. At that moment, I realized that high school was never over.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I remember talking to someone from another team.

At that moment, I realized that high school was never over.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from my own personal challenges, I also had the challenge of maintaining my family life as well. I knew that once I started my four hour a day commute, it would be a difficult to find someone to pick up my son from the school bus. I have two other step-children, so there&#8217;s three kids altogether that need to be cared for. Fortunately, between my husband and family—and sometimes I would even have to leave class and do pick up—we worked it out.  I would get home at 8:00 or 8:30. The kids go to bed at 9:30. I wouldn&#8217;t see them very much, but fortunately they were all understanding. It was hard to feel so out of touch with my family but I felt it was important to do this for myself—and also for the kids. They need to see the importance of not giving up and hopefully the importance of learning how to code. </span></p>\n<p><b>What are some of the most exciting things to you of working in tech and coding? What part of the work really activates you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My first week at my new job, we all had a one-week bootcamp to get us to understand how the technology department operates. We went over everything from setting up dev environments to database schemas. I was in these classes with people who went to big colleges or had years of experiences or master degrees in computer science. Seeing that I was able to contribute to the conversations—and even knew about some topics that maybe some of them didn’t—felt really good. It reminded me that I had made the right choice to quit my job and take that chance. Understanding technology and knowing a coding language really gives you magic powers. It&#8217;s like being Harry Potter. You have a power that not many people do. And I think for me, I feel more excited about it because it was something that three years ago I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to say that I would be able to do this. It&#8217;s all still very surreal.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Understanding technology and knowing a coding language really gives you magic powers. It&#8217;s like being Harry Potter. You have a power that not many people do.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>What are the biggest motivators behind your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My husband first, then the kids. My husband is very encouraging to me and that in turn motivates me. I want him to see that I can go from knowing so little, to having tech-related conversations without any issue. Tech is his world and I want to join him and be part of it. Steve would be proud of anything I do, but it makes me happy that I am joining him in “The Matrix.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We tell the kids that coding is very important to learn. I feel it&#8217;s important for the future for people to understand how to code and being in tune with technology. We sent the kids to coding classes. I wanted them to see me making that effort to learn the topic that we preach about so often. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, I am motivated by becoming an inspiration for someone else who is in a similar situation. I started taking phone calls for people that are interested in Hackbright or another coding bootcamp, people who maybe aren&#8217;t sure about the commitment. I actually just got an email today from one young lady who said, &#8220;I really appreciate that you encouraged me and told me the benefits of going down this path. I was just accepted to Hackbright!&#8221; You get to the point when you&#8217;re older that you realize there are things that, if you want to do them you&#8217;re going to have to sacrifice. I didn&#8217;t want to take no for an answer. I didn&#8217;t want to say my time is up. I wanted to be part of the Harry Potter group and know the magic.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where have you found support networks along the way? Obviously your family, but have you found them in the industry as well?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I found most of my support through co-workers in the security industry. I had some mentors, and they&#8217;re all men, which I love, because I feel that a lot of women want to be in the industry: They want to be software engineers, they want to be QA testers, they want to be in security, but the ratio is more men. I&#8217;m the only female on my team right now, which could make people uncomfortable. I am very comfortable with it and I don’t even think about the ratio. Maybe others don&#8217;t feel that they have that support, but I actually feel that I have had a lot of support. </span></p>\n<p><b>How do your family and friends from your past feel about how much your life has changed and all the work that you&#8217;ve done?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a coworker, Katie, that still can&#8217;t believe that I&#8217;ve made it to this point, because she said—her and I, we took a Python class together at Facebook—&#8221;I can&#8217;t believe it. You said you wanted to do this and here you are and you&#8217;re working. You&#8217;re an engineer.&#8221; She gave up on learning Python. It wasn’t for her, but it was nice of her to congratulate and be supportive. Honestly, I don&#8217;t know if my family quite grasps what it is that I do. I think they get it, but not really. They are extremely supportive in knowing that I wanted to do something and achieved it, but I am not sure they understand the job.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you think the culmination of your background and your life experiences impact the way you approach your work as an engineer?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting my first tech job made me feel like a fish out of water. I felt like I knew nothing. So to survive one day at a time I used my experience in marketing, PR, just working with people in general. This is a huge asset to have. If I came straight from just a tech background, you know I went for a tech major and maybe I didn&#8217;t have that interpersonal skills, it wouldn&#8217;t make it as easy for me to just go up to someone and say, &#8220;I&#8217;m not really getting this, but, with your help I may.” I feel that my communication skills have come into play and I feel it is something that can really help the team when working with other teams and developers. </span></p>\n<p><b>As far as 2016 goals, what little things are you working on right now, either for work or for yourself? Like what are the things you want to accomplish this year?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2016 goals are learn as much as I can about being an applications security engineer. Understanding the vulnerabilities, understanding how to secure code and understanding all the acronyms that I hear during the day. It&#8217;s all new to me. Lending Club gave me an opportunity to learn, and I&#8217;m going to run with that. I want to still practice everything I learned at Hackbright because that was the golden ticket that got me in. I also would like to continue to help other women that are in the same place that I was in. I had moments of serious doubt and I can’t believe I thought about not taking this chance. If I could help sway more women to trust in themselves and just go for it, that would be wonderful. </span></p>\n<p><b>From kind of a high level, how do you feel about the state of technology in 2016? What really excites you, and what would you like to see change?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s a good question. I am very impressed with the way that technology is progressing. I like the ideas. I like that there&#8217;s always something new. It&#8217;s hard to keep up, I have to say. You think you have found the best tool to help with a current project, and then something new and more advanced comes out. I really enjoy that and love seeing the speed of progression. The amount of intelligence out there right now, even just in Silicon Valley is huge. I work with so many insanely intelligent people which has me very excited about the future and what is to come. </span></p>\n<p>As far as what I would like to see change, right now, and it has been for the last couple years when I&#8217;ve been working, my goal has been to get into security. Rewind a little bit, when I was at Facebook, I knew I wanted to get into security. I had no idea how to do it. This is before even seriously considering Hackbright. I went to Jen Henley, who is the director of security operations at Facebook, and she sat down with me and just kind of gave me a guide on what to do to get into security. I started volunteering with their security awareness events, and then I went to work for WhiteHat Security. My husband is in security, and so by osmosis, I learned to love it. I think that it is an area of technology that is overseen. People are looking for the next best company, the next best app, but they&#8217;re not looking at the dangers that are involved in it. They are not taking the time to understand all the possible vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited. All of our lives are on technology. Everything important to you in online, your information, your personal lives, your photos, your family, and if someone&#8217;s not out there protecting that then all is lost.</p>\n<p><b>What advice would you give to folks who are feeling like they have similar backgrounds to yours? Maybe they feel like their ship has sailed, they&#8217;ve had kids, they are in their thirties, they feel like that there&#8217;s no way that they could get into tech now, but they would love to. What advice would you have for those folks? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My advice is, time is going to pass anyway. Someone told me this a couple years ago and it resonated with me. It&#8217;s true. Time is going to pass anyway, and you don&#8217;t want to go down the road and think, “You know, I wish I did x, y, z.” For me, I went to a start-up convention and I just looked around and saw these people making these exciting new tech tools to improve our everyday life and I just thought, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I need to know this, I want to be part of this</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If someone is working in a position and they&#8217;re unfulfilled or dream of changing positions and making a career change, and they think, “I’m too old or I have kids, I can&#8217;t do it,” then my advice is that time is going to pass regardless, and you don&#8217;t want to regret it not taking that chance. You only have one life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You could go down it by going through a boot camp. You could look at CodeAcademy or, just take a Girl Develop It class for beginners. Start somewhere and I promise the momentum will take you the rest of the way. I took some online courses and GDI classes before I went to Hackbright. Just getting that little bit of experience is enough to drive you to continue on and finish the journey. I went from what I was doing—aesthetician work at ten dollars an hour a couple days a week—to a great job as an Associate Application Security Engineer. It was not an easy journey. I got denied a lot. I interviewed a lot, I got turned down a lot. My path was not paved with open doors. I faced a lot of disappointment in all phases of my journey. It worked out, and I would say don&#8217;t get discouraged. Just keep going, because it&#8217;ll happen.</span></p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Okay, great. So why don&#8217;t we start at the beginning. Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, my early years&#8230; I come a from a city that feels pretty much like a small town in North Mexico called Chihuahua. Historically and geographically, it has been pretty isolated and is a bit of a singularity in the sense that the proximity to the border creates a culture that is similar to the American Southwest, but at the same time has a unique feel of Mexico. There&#8217;s a lot of pride about being from that area and that pride manifests itself in the observance of traditions, which include the strict definitions Mexico has about the role women are expected to play in society. </span></p>\n<p>I was born there in the 1980s, and I come from a long line of people that have grown, and lived, and stayed there forever. Compared to previous generations, I’m actually one of the rare stories of “people who left town.” <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My parents have a very Mexican success story: my dad runs his own business and occupies a very masculine role in the family; my mom went to college and finished her master’s degree, but then chose to be a stay-at-home-mom after she had us.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was born there in the 1980s, and I come from a long line of people that have grown, and lived, and stayed there forever. Compared to previous generations, I’m actually one of the rare stories of &#8216;people who left town.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the beginning, things seemed to point that I was going to be another kid that grew up there and was destined to get absorbed by the grind of the area. Outside of family businesses—and because of the proximity to the U.S.—most people there end up working in factory jobs. It&#8217;s either being part of an assembly line of some sort or managing manufacturing process and operations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went to school and studied electronic engineering, and throughout my studies, the mindset and the way people thought about their job opportunities in the future were like: &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m going to get this awesome job at this huge company’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maquila</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (manufacturing site) where I can put my skills to work.&#8221; That was just something that never felt quite right for me, just as many other aspects of my environment back then didn&#8217;t.</span></p>\n<p><b>So you pursued electronic engineering. Did you have technical inclinations in childhood? What made you interested in that in the first place? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What made me interested in that is that I&#8217;ve always had this—I&#8217;m drawn into trying to understand how things work. I&#8217;m a very analytical person and a perfectionist; this makes me want to understand the excruciating details of how things work and connect. It’s funny, because it applies also to the perception of the self. I always thought it was the norm, but one of my first distinct memories as a child is about troubleshooting myself: being very aware of the things I perceived, the people I saw, and how they interacted with each other and with me. </span></p>\n<p>For me, going into a STEM degree seemed like just an extension of my deep interest in understanding how the world works.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Electronics seemed like such a fascinating field too, it was not something that I just learn by observing, I had to study and play with it. So it always occupied a special space in my mind.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;For me, going into a STEM degree seemed like just an extension of my deep interest in understanding how the world works.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the first tangible events that inclined me pursue that degree was my first experience with Internet. I think I was about 12 when we first got Internet in Chihuahua. I remember going to this summer camp where they had like, I don&#8217;t know, 50 or 60 kids, and they were showing us “the Internet”. I was fascinated and wanted to know more about how that magical thing worked. Two things interested me. First, you have a piece of hardware—a computer—that creates this space for people to communicate.  Secondly, you also have a bunch of other things that somehow exist inside that space. Obviously, at the time I couldn’t wrap my head around it or make the differentiation between hardware and software, but being able to participate in something that felt much bigger than me made me realize I needed to learn more about it. </span></p>\n<p><b>You were, from what I read, the only woman in your graduating college class. Was there any push back to you pursuing this field?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. </span>There was always push back and commentary around pursuing engineering. I think this even started a generation before mine. My mom wanted to be an architect and back then—that was around the seventies—my grandfather completely put his foot down and told her, &#8220;no, you can&#8217;t study that. That&#8217;s a man’s profession.” Women that want to get married—because that&#8217;s basically what the role of women in society is in Mexico—did not pursue those careers back then.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I remember growing up and seeing that, while my mom enjoyed her life and loved being with us, she also regretted not pursuing the path that she actually wanted to follow. I think she got a chance later in life to put that passion to work when my parents built their own house, but I feel that she always had this regret.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There was always push back and commentary around pursuing engineering.

This is such a rigid and cerebral major. It doesn&#8217;t seem to match what you would want out of your life. You have a good track record, why don&#8217;t you go to a field that would put your skills to a better use?&#8221; Of course </span>the definitions of “my life” and “my skills” were generally constrained by the narrow view of what a woman should want and be capable of.<strong>   </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I even remember having a very good friend in my class tell me things like, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re going to have to name you an honorary man because otherwise we can&#8217;t get things done.&#8221; Or being told by a male colleague &#8220;Well, see this is the thing; I&#8217;m not going to be able to treat you like a woman because you&#8217;re smarter than what a woman should be. So I will need to make an exception about how we treat each other.&#8221;  At the time it seemed oddly flattering, but it was always me, and the rest of women, and then my colleagues.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I had to deal with others not only discouraging me with best intentions, but also questioning my ability to get things done, and making me feel really alienated.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My time in college had these interesting factors: </span>I had to deal with others not only discouraging me with best intentions, but also questioning my ability to get things done, and making me feel really alienated. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had the luck that my brother actually pursued the same degree—we&#8217;re just one year apart—and he was relentlessly supportive of me and a great help. We took several classes together, and having him there to tell me &#8220;I know you, and I know you can do this. You&#8217;re great, and nothing else matters. Keep going at it,&#8221; was really, really helpful. Him, and having my parents supporting my inclination for pursuing things that were out of the norm, were the two things that fueled me to keep going.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, as the only woman in an engineering class, people think that you have to leave behind your femininity. There’s this attitude of, &#8220;You can&#8217;t be an engineer and dress like a girl. You can&#8217;t be an engineer and expect to be taken seriously, if you&#8217;re wearing something that&#8217;s this color, or if you&#8217;re doing your hair in a certain way.” </span></p>\n<p>Dating in college was funny: I would tell people what my degree was, most of them were like, &#8220;Why are you studying that? Women don&#8217;t study that.&#8221;  Or even have guys abruptly end conversations under the basis of &#8220;you’re not the type of woman I&#8217;m looking for&#8221; after finding out what I studied<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—standing 5’9” didn’t help either :).</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Dating in college was funny: I would tell people what my degree was, most of them were like, &#8216;Why are you studying that?

Then you ended up going to grad school in the United States. What was the motivation for moving to the States? </b></p>\n<p>That comes way later. Moving to another country was never in my initial plan, it was something that just became possible as I advanced in my engineering career.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I first interned for a car manufacturer subsidiary, where we designed car cluster systems and quality tests. These systems are basically the panel in your dashboard that tells you whether your engine is okay, you have enough gas, and things like that. Part of it required coding in different languages, and gave me enough experience to then apply for a developer position in a Fortune 500 auto parts retailer as part of their IT operations in Mexico. I was fortunate enough to get a developer role there. It was not really aligned with what I thought I would end up doing with an electronic engineering degree, but it seemed like the right choice to make at the time, since most of my other EE prospects were back in some stage of manufacturing and I wanted to create and understand.</span></p>\n<p>The closest I could get to building stuff was software. It was engineering work and I felt passionate about learning, so I grew into the role regardless of the usual “you’re one of the few women” challenges.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I eventually moved into a leadership position because I had a really good mentor that believed in me and gave me the shot, even if I was still pretty much fresh out of school. When I became a team lead, I started noticing that I wanted to learn more about how to be more effective at both managing projects and people—these were skills I never had developed with my original degree. It took me a long time to crystallize an awareness that there was a gap in my knowledge in those areas; then to actually get to the point where I could execute on it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So there I was, leading a team of developers about two years and a half before I could even start acting on my pursuit and when I found out that Harvard had online courses that could be used to apply for a full program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They don&#8217;t accept you right away. They require you first take three courses relevant to the program and have certain grades—B+ I think. One of the programs was really aligned with the things I wanted to learn and do.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was working full time at that moment and you had to pay upfront, so I could not stop working if I wanted to study and I didn’t want to be tied up the terms of a scholarship. I didn’t have a great plan, but I ended up throwing myself into it, like &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s take this on.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>Completing the first courses at Harvard while working full-time was rough. I had a demanding position that would have me at work at 7 am, back at home around 6 pm—but often still on-call—to watch class and then figure out how to stay awake to work on my assignments.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Completing the first courses at Harvard while working full-time was rough.

I had very little spare time and most of my paycheck was actually either funding current classes or going into a savings account for whatever I had to do next. I knew I really wanted to do this, but I had no clue how I was going to make it happen. I could only keep going. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I finished the courses I needed to get accepted into the program and had saved enough money to move over to Cambridge and find a job over there. I could not afford to just be a full time student and the student visa process could take another year or more. I was already running low on an empty tank after two years of the numerous personal, professional, and health tradeoffs I had to make to get to this point. Waiting more wasn’t in the realm of possibilities if I wanted to finish. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I quit my good paying job and moved in time for summer school and looked for work for a few months. I finally found a contractor job as a developer that left me in an interesting immigration and financial situation.  I could only take projects the staffing company approved, but unfortunately the region hit a bad economic time, and most of the jobs that we were expecting to find were not there anymore. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The situation was pretty precarious, without projects I didn’t have an income, but I still had to figure out my school and living expenses. I couldn’t take any other jobs under the risk of deportation, and I also spent a good chunk of my non-school time looking for projects and taking dead-end interviews that didn’t pan out and turn into real opportunities. My family helped, but they could only do so much with the distance and the currency exchange. It was a really interesting time in my life. </span>I not only got to experience the challenges of being alone in a completely new place and working on my degree, but I also became very sensitive and aware of what it means to be an immigrant in this country; the adversities people need to overcome even if they have the best intentions and all the qualifications to pitch into a community.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I not only got to experience the challenges of being alone in a completely new place and working on my degree, but I also became very sensitive and aware of what it means to be an immigrant in this country; the adversities people need to overcome even if they have the best intentions and all the qualifications to pitch into a community.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Yeah. Tell me more about what it was like—being at Harvard, working full time, being an immigrant in a new country—did you know anyone else like you at all? </b></p>\n<p>Not too many people. And that was actually really hard on me. While in Mexico, I could rely on my family and had constant and reliable support from them. This proximity evaporated the moment I moved to the U.S. This change, combined with all the job and immigration challenges, caused me to gradually lose my self-confidence and my belief that I could get things done.</p>\n<p>People in privileged situations tend to optimize for the things that will give them the highest returns, including the relationships they engage in. At the time, I was not looking very hot in those people&#8217;s book, so it was hard to both make connections and friends who were truly interested in being part of my life. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It also didn’t help that everyone was incredibly busy; people had jobs, many goals, and tended to be in networking-all-the-time mode. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were a couple of organizations that I reached out to, and that started incorporating myself with more, but it still felt kind of forced. Maybe I had the wrong expectations about it, but it felt like you had to script your interactions and wear a mask to look appealing—to motivate people enough to start a relationship. That was really tolling and very different to what I was used to in Mexico.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;People in privileged situations tend to optimize for the things that will give them the highest returns, including the relationships they engage in.

Having them was incredibly important for my sanity, but there was very little they could do to help with the job and immigration woes. For example, during a dry season of contracting projects, one of my professors offered me the opportunity to TA a class. It didn&#8217;t pay a lot, but it was a chance to get some money in and I felt really excited. I brought this offer back as a potential project to the company sponsoring my visa, but they declined since it was more expensive for them to have me make a little money than none at all.  Looking back at this makes me wonder what could I have done differently to take on opportunities like this. </span></p>\n<p><b>So interesting. What happened after your graduated?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I actually ended up not completing my degree in Cambridge. We had a computer science fair in winter. I was showing off a project and had the luck to run into a <a href=\"http://dropbox.com\" target=\"_blank\">Dropbox</a> recruiter. We started chatting and he set me up for an interview. I started the interview cycle knowing my savings were pretty much dried up, the project situation hadn’t picked up, and my staying in the country would be difficult—if not impossible—if I couldn’t find a new project or an alternative soon. A few months without projects meant no visa sponsorship, which would result in dropping my studies and going back home to scramble. I was facing a harsh reality: I had a narrow chance of finishing my degree, after about a year of doing everything in my power to try to make things work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went through the interview cycle with Dropbox knowing I liked the company and I HAD to figure things out. The team was great and I knew I wanted to be part of it. Fortunately they liked me too and made me an offer, right after my other contract and visa fell through and I had a few days left to pack my stuff and go back home. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This offer allowed me to stay, but I still had to finish school. Dropbox agreed to give me a few months to wrap up most of the coursework back in Cambridge, while I negotiated with my career adviser to take the remaining classes from California. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I came to the point where I grabbed the few things I had and asked my boyfriend—who is German and had his own immigration woes—if he wanted to come with me to the other side of the country. He said yes, and we moved to California to start what would be my first year working full-time at Dropbox, finishing the remaining coursework, and finding time for a project I had started in the fall with some summer school folks.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I would often wake up at 5 am to have meetings with my partners in Europe, go to work, come back, code for an hour, and then work on my assignments until I couldn’t keep my eyes open. Six months of trying to do these three things was enough to put me in my place: I fainted at work, ended up having pneumonia, and was completely immobile for three weeks.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s a little bit of a parenthesis worth going into. That same year, I started working on a small tech venture with a few people I met in summer school. Most were part of an international program and were back in Europe when we started working on this knowledge management social network. At a high level, this project was looking to solve issues around reputable and peer-reviewed sources for academic research and how you get specialists to connect with the industry. It’s a hard problem to solve and I worked on this in between failed interviews and class assignments, because it was motivating and interesting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When all other things started to go south, the project had kept me from feeling like a complete failure, so it was only natural that I decided to continue to work on it while I ramped up at Dropbox and worked on my few last courses remotely.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This wasn’t cheap: </span>I would often wake up at 5 am to have meetings with my partners in Europe, go to work, come back, code for an hour, and then work on my assignments until I couldn’t keep my eyes open. Six months of trying to do these three things was enough to put me in my place: I fainted at work, ended up having pneumonia, and was completely immobile for three weeks.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I felt really frustrated and angry because I knew that I had put myself in that situation and jeopardized my well-being; at the same time it was really hard to decide between this moonshot I had contributed to create from scratch and the ability to build a stable future with my partner in this country. I wanted to be and belong somewhere again, so I chose the latter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having to let go of that project will forever linger as a “what-if” that I may come to regret. However, I had to do what was right for getting my health and my work situation normalized, to finish my degree, and to get to the point that I could actually stay in the U.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After I moved here it became really apparent was that the opportunities and the things that I could achieve here were eons away from the stuff I imagined in Mexico.  A woman&#8217;s place in the US is not as narrow and constrained as it is in the Mexican society and there is a lot of space for creation.  I just had to figure out how to stay.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;After I moved here it became really apparent was that the opportunities and the things that I could achieve here were eons away from the stuff I imagined in Mexico.  A woman&#8217;s place in the US is not as narrow and constrained as it is in the Mexican society and there is a lot of space for creation.  I just had to figure out how to stay.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Walk me through your experience working in Silicon Valley. How has it been for you? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s been, for the most part, a great learning experience. I feel very privileged and fortunate to have arrived to a point in my career where I&#8217;m finally doing something that I’m really passionate about full-time. I’m currently a Product Manager for the Dropbox desktop platform and the role has the right combination of technical challenge—for my analytical mind—and collaborative work to give me the space to be a positive agent of change. However, I was not immediately hired into this position. I started almost three years ago as a support engineer; getting to where I am today has been journey of its own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have to recognize that, while I set the milestones and direction for this adventure, Dropbox has been an incomparable development platform. The organization attracts incredibly talented people who are also really open, which generates a lot of opportunities for mentoring and learning. All the teams I’ve been a part of have demonstrated willingness to support and enable professional growth, overall if you have an idea of where you want to go or have concrete skills you want to obtain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tech can be a bit disconcerting for folks coming from other industries, overall when you look at really young companies that are the process of finding their values and character. When I joined I definitely went through an initial cultural shock. Between the famed Whiskey Fridays, where the whole company would party together, and the sometimes hilarious first world problems people would bring up, I felt like an alien in a parallel universe.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have to say, getting to spend time with my colleagues in a relaxed setting, allowed me to get to know them better and see there was a ton of substance behind that initial “elite party people” impression. It still took me some time to get over how disconnected from reality one can grow in this dreamlike environment. This is not Dropbox-specific, but probably more of a Bay Area thing. </span>I’d hear people upset about having to deal with scheduling their Exec—a chore &amp; task-doer service—when all I could think was that three months ago, I was making budgeting-fu just to buy groceries and eat more than lentils every day.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It still took me some time to get over how disconnected from reality one can grow in this dreamlike environment.

I could never articulate this in a conversation, but </span>on occasions it seemed as if everyone I met had just been incredibly privileged and had never seen any hardships or experienced any setbacks in their life. It was of course a wrong first impression, which was mostly catalyzed by the competitive environment and the way it pushed people in general to be more vocal about their success than their failures.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overtime, I was able to see all the humanity and the individuals behind those pristine and seemingly homogenous fronts. I believe Dropbox also realized that individuality and diversity is a key success factor, and little by little started dedicating cycles and very conscious efforts to attract and develop people from different backgrounds and mindsets.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;On occasions it seemed as if everyone I met had just been incredibly privileged and had never seen any hardships or experienced any setbacks in their life.

To me this is a huge leap and goes beyond the amount of change certain industries would be willing to challenge themselves to execute. I guess you can say that </span>while tech can come across as immature, it is also pretty quick to identify issues, think through solutions, implement them (as imperfect as they might be), observe, and self-correct.</p>\n<p><b>Yeah. Where have you found your support networks since you moved here? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My boyfriend has been my everlasting partner in crime, advisor, and even the driver of some healthy competition.  I’ve also kept close ties with my family, despite the distance. However, this time around I made it a point to find meaningful friendships and forge fulfilling professional relationships. Luckily, Dropbox is a great place to meet amazing people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a way, I think a lot of my friends ended up choosing me first, before I even knew we could be friends.  Some of us gravitated together because we were expats or were completely overwhelmed by the stark differences between where we came from and San Francisco. This immediate empathy and understanding that comes from knowing you don’t have to explain all your thoughts, instead you can go through an experience together, and give each other the courage to keep moving and making your voice be heard in this enormous jungle.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowing other people cared, even if they were not close friends, also helped a lot. It’s funny how you don’t have to even know a person to show that you care and make a difference in their life. If I have to be honest, </span>soon after I moved, I still had this insecurity that held me back from reaching out or forging relationships with people because of past experiences. I was a very introverted and withdrawn person for about a year before I could get over myself and open to people again. I have to thank those few folks that cared, and those who didn’t give up on me and became my friends. Those people who opened their houses and just asked me random questions about who I was and didn’t realize they were helping me get back on my feet again.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve also had great mentors and teammates. My previous manager was a big influence and a great professional support. A lot of things didn’t immediately work to get where I wanted to go, but she was incredibly encouraging and didn’t let me cave in, even if this pursuit meant leaving her team.  Similarly, my current manager, went beyond anything our previous work relationship required, and was the architect for some of the opportunities that allowed me to prove myself and build the skills needed for my current role.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Soon after I moved, I still had this insecurity that held me back from reaching out or forging relationships with people because of past experiences.

I would love to hear your thoughts on Silicon Valley versus the tech scene in Latin America. What is similar and what is different? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh god! First of all, I think that something that Latin America is constantly limiting itself to what other countries are doing in terms of innovation. Mexico in particular, is also very constrained by outdated regulations and ancient cultural paradigms. As a country, Mexico operates in an extremely hierarchical fashion, and in my experience, this is contrary to what you want in an environment when you want fast innovation like a start-up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Innovation requires a collective and targeted effort, a group people pushing forward new ideas and solving problems to achieve a common goal. It doesn&#8217;t matter who comes up with the solution as long as there&#8217;s movement and breakthroughs that either move you closer to your objective or prove that it’s not worth pursuing. In Mexico this is mostly inconceivable, company culture stems from the concept of El Jefe, the boss, who is this almost epic figure who is both the CEO and looks at the big picture, but also needs to make all the calls and solve every other problem.  This is not only problematic because El Jefe rarely ends up being so epic, but it also disempower individuals and very few people get to experience a truly collaborative and semi-democratic environment. Mexican companies have a lot of problems to move forward if they don’t find a way to properly manage this. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funding is also a huge issue. There is not that much capital laying around, and most people who have it not want to risk in technology bets, they prefer going for re-appropriating concepts proven elsewhere, or flat out projects that would further a political or social position. </span>Mexico favors homogeneous and understood situations, being an exception or different can be a stigma more than a competitive advantage. This is a huge deterrent for innovators.</p>\n<p>It’s a really interesting situation, because Mexico is in a privileged position to solve and understand problems that affect markets that Silicon Valley can’t wrap its head around, because they don’t exist here. If we, Mexicans, could self-analyze more and emulate less, the country would be in a much better spot.</p>\n<p>Being an entrepreneur at scale is not common in Mexico. In general, this is reserved for people who come from money or have political connections.  Most of the new business are mom and pop shops, and even then, people who want to start their own, often need to do it as a side job first to build some capital.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Mexico favors homogeneous and understood situations, being an exception or different can be a stigma more than a competitive advantage.

What is exciting to you? What is frustrating to you? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will come across as very odd, but </span>I’m intrigued to see how the tech scene matures and deals with economic de-acceleration. The possibility of economic troubles is never exciting, but I think there is a lot of great development and ideation takes place in less plentiful times.  Ideas and societies need to stand the proof of time, so I’m very curious about how things will fare after a bit of healthy natural selection.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking about more positive things, I&#8217;m also really interested in seeing the momentum and impact around initiatives to make tech more diverse and to tighten its relationship with communities.  There still are a lot of opportunities to drive positive change.  It sometimes frustrates me to be faced with the sweeping assumption and perception that tech is an evil and selfish industry.  It’s imperfect—as any human endeavor—but there is definitely a lot of willingness and talent that is being used towards the common good.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’m intrigued to see how the tech scene matures and deals with economic de-acceleration.

How do you think the combination of your background and life experiences impact the way that you approach your work? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My life experiences have definitely made me overly aware other people&#8217;s feelings. I ended up developing a keen sense of empathy that I sometimes have to manage. It’s funny because, it can be overwhelming at times and I end up burying myself in technical or analytical tasks to balance it out. I rarely externalize this though!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My background is a obviously helpful and aligned with the things I want to accomplish nowadays. Having seen so many worse case scenarios, allows me to see things others tend to overlook and play devil’s advocate. You know that one important thing you forgot to do in that really important project? It’s most likely one of the things I’m thinking about right now. In a way I tend to take the posture of the forgotten because I have experienced it first hand many times. I think that&#8217;s one of the biggest values that I bring in both my role, and my daily interactions with people. My ability to understand, not only how people do something, but also their motivations, and to analyze a given situation and break it into smaller digestible chunks that can be looked at from various perspectives.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you think tech could do a better job of integrating different backgrounds and viewpoints into their product? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To begin, I think it’s really important for tech companies to validate their products outside Silicon Valley. Doing user studies people from different regions and occupations to figure out if what we’re building is actually valuable across the board. Getting users in the Bay Area can be pretty much of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The time designing a product has a good understanding of technology, and they validate products with people who live in an area where technology is prevalent and have expectations that are quite aligned with the ideas companies are producing. If it’s not done carefully, these exercises can be the equivalent of asking yourself if you like what you just did. A diverse set of users and opinions can immediately and positively impact the way we develop and think about products.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can take that a step further by bringing people from different backgrounds into companies, which is a really hard problem to solve.  There are some historical and cultural components to the current makeup of the tech workforce. You can think about this situation in two time dimensions: today, we need to make sure people from different backgrounds and with the right skills have the opportunity to join tech; longer term, we need to make sure we increase the pool of people with skills and make these more attainable and accessible. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m personally particularly interested in the future investments we can do to improve this situation. How tech companies can partner with academia, government, and other institutions to make sure <a href=\"http://www.stemedcoalition.org/\" target=\"_blank\">STEM</a> education and critical thinking skills become part of the norm for future generations.  This is key, not only to make tech more diverse, but also to prepare for what humankind will face in the next 30 years in terms of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence\" target=\"_blank\">AI</a> developments.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is entirely possible that the job market as we have it today will cease to exist due to increased automation and technification. It is crucial that we think how we can empower future generations to thrive in this abysmally different context. Think about the impact a very specific type of technology will have, self-driving cars, for example, can turn around the enormous transportation industry and displace a number of direct and indirect jobs.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tech is in this privileged position to both further products and experiences, but also to see these type of potential social and human crisis before they happen.  We should think about products, yes, but also about how we can contribute to create a sustainable future and human development opportunities for the coming generations. How can we help schools to create curriculums that prepare people not for the jobs we had 30 years ago but for the jobs that will exist in 30 years?</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in five or ten years? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I couldn’t well you </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">where</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the world I’ll be.  Hopefully around here, the weather is really nice! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professionally, I would love to take the curiosity I had to put on hold, and start my own company. That little worm is still in the back of my mind. I would love to work in a project that challenges on my ability to look at problems from a fresh perspective, and also allows me to do something that&#8217;s humanly impactful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My daily work is pretty satisfying, but creating something that can result in a perceivable improvement to human problems I care deeply about, would be beyond amazing. I feel really proud about the technical and design feats behind the experiences a product like Dropbox delivers; how seemingly small changes can make people more productive and happy. However, the learning and knowledge space is still something that profoundly resonates with me, and I would love to explore ideas in the boundary where information becomes actionable-knowledge.  I honestly don&#8217;t spend a lot of time thinking about specifics, because I know that once I start something my brain gets in this override mode and other things become secondary. It’s not time yet, but it’s definitely in the horizon. </span></p>\n<p><b>My last question for you would be based on all the things that you&#8217;ve learned, what advice would you give folks from similar backgrounds to you that are hoping to get into tech? </b></p>\n<p>Don’t let anyone define or put a limit to what you can do. Not even yourself.  A lot of the times the issues that hold us back, are only the manifestation of our own insecurities and how much weight we give to people’s opinions in our lives. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>My 20 year old self had no way of knowing I could come to where I am. That reality didn’t exist, I had no precedents or role models. All I had was a world of questions, some incomplete notion of self-worth, and a lot of tenacity. I let the questions and the curiosity lead me, instead of letting what I or others thought I could do, define me.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of those questions led to dead-ends and failures, but also taught me something. My questions grew bigger and my answers started coming faster. The only costs were to keep trying and not giving up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to get in tech, just do that, try. As painful—as bad as it can be, you will learn from doing. You will not accomplish anything by staying static waiting for your shot to come. Always be doing and always be open to changing the way you think about yourself and the problems around you. Most skills are a matter of time and patience, but the ability to analyze, self-correct, and motivate yourself will always be crucial to grow, regardless of the end goal.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Don’t let anyone define or put a limit to what you can do.

I got my start as the editor at my college paper there. It was a self-supporting newspaper with a 250-person paid staff. That was where I learned to write and edit, how to manage people, how to fire someone. It put myself through school writing five articles a week on top of my course load, it was good practice for the internet.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I grew up thinking I wanted to be an elementary school teacher. But by college people would argue when I told them that. &#8220;No, you want to be CEO of something.&#8221; Outside perspectives can be helpful when you’re 19. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By graduation I knew I wanted to own my own business, so I started a silk screening shop, and it was the pits. I had trouble motivating to go in and work, so took a part time maid job to force a schedule. I would clean from 7-8 a.m., and then I would go to “the studio,”  which was a rented U-Haul space. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One day when the fire marshal came to the door. I literally had a room-sized drying machine that would routinely set t-shirts on fire. And I mean, like once every maybe 30 minutes something was smoking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He knocked and said, &#8220;We need to do a check of the premises.&#8221; I was thinking, “Things are on fire </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">right now.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> As I am here answering the door, things are catching fire.”  So I said, &#8220;Oh! Well, my boss isn&#8217;t here. Can you come back another day?” And he was like, &#8220;What are you doing in here?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Painting t-shirts.&#8221; And I made a motion like I was using  a paintbrush. He was like, &#8220;Okay. We&#8217;re good then.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then I went back and put out all the fires that had caught in my absence. I eventually got out and worked as a secretary for a year or so. It was incredible to just go home at 5 p.m. and be done with my day. </span></p>\n<p><b>How did you get into tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One day a friend called from the Bay Area and said, &#8220;I get $3K if you&#8217;re hired as an editor. You’re interviewing.&#8221; They were offering hiring bonuses for referrals because tech needed warm bodies. That’s how I became the assistant editor at the prestigious </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Windows NT Systems </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">magazine. </span></p>\n<p><b>What was that like?</b></p>\n<p>Well, I was broke. I was living in a crawlspace in a garage in San Mateo. Literally the door to my closet was a cabinet door seven feet off the ground with no ladder. I would climb up onto a nightstand and heft myself up into the room.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But even if I’d had money, there were no apartments. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No one in San Francisco would rent to you if you were in tech because there was such a backlash against tech workers coming to the city.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was in this weird place where I was like, I have an English degree and I am making $20,000 a year. I can&#8217;t afford to live without roommates, and literally no one will even talk to me because I&#8217;m technically working in tech right now. </span></p>\n<p><b>Really?</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. It was bad. That magazine eventually closed, so I applied for a new job as an associate managing editor for a magazine called </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Web Techniques</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it was for C-level web execs. I worked my way up from there to senior editor and then managing editor by the time I was 25. The editor in chief was 26, which was unheard of at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I still wasn&#8217;t making enough money to live in San Francisco, so at night we would go through our PR invites and hit all the launch parties that advertised free food and drinks.  And then sometimes you couldn&#8217;t get a cab back. We had all this inflatable furniture in the office left over from the conferences our company threw, so we would go back and sleep on the inflatable furniture in empty cubes.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I remember at one of those parties there was a girl in head-to-toe Prada, and I said to my editor, &#8220;That girl&#8217;s outfit cost more than her parents’ car. What is happening right now? There’s no way this can last.&#8221; </span></i></p>\n<p><b>And it didn’t. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, it did not. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Web Techniques</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> eventually closed in the bust. And over the years, the tech crowd shifted. </span></p>\n<p><b>How so?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the start, tech attracted true nerds, people who had been picked last at kickball and knew what it was like to be marginalized. There was just a wealth of sensitive, really bright, motivated, charming young men who maybe were a little awkward with women, but who were respectful of the community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was a journalist, South by Southwest Interactive was only a few hundred people. You knew everyone there. You definitely knew who all the women were, because there were so few of us. At that time, by virtue of you being there, there was more of an assumption of your right to be there, because there were so few people in the space. If you were there, you were part of it, it was meaningful. There was sexism, of course, but it wasn’t as widespread and overt.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since San Francisco became an industry town focused on tech, there’s been a shift away from people being more creatively oriented. There are fewer futurists and more people focused on money. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the social web came into play, things started to turn. You’ll approach a group of men, a few of them are friends, but maybe one or two of them don&#8217;t know you. When you approach, often the new guys make the assumption that you’re not a meaningful presence. And so, they do all of the things that people do when they discount you. They turn their body away from you. They turn you out of the circle. They don&#8217;t make eye contact in a prolonged conversation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And now, and this is gross, I sometimes find myself doing it. When I see a woman around a lot, I occasionally will assume that she&#8217;s someone’s wife, as opposed to assuming that she’s a tech person. You just don’t see a lot of female faces.</span></p>\n<p><b>How did you get into blogging?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working at the magazines, I met a lot of the people who formed what we think of as the social web today. I already had a personal site when I was editing a sidebar in the magazine about Blogger. So I turned my site into a blog.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many, many years later it became possible to making a living with your blog, but the landscape was nothing like it is today. There were very few subject-specific blogs, maybe a handful focused on tech. And then Movable Type came on the scene and gave some more powerful content management tools. I realized that you could use that to make a magazine-style blog, and that no one was looking at more traditionally female topics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I launched a site called Mighty Goods, it was the first shopping blog. It was, I think, the first content-specific blog aimed at a a female audience. It was among the first handful of blogs that focused on a specific topic. It was listed as one of Time Magazine’s Top 50 sites, so I launched a couple of sister sites — Mighty Junior and Mighty House — and all of those were eventually acquired.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mighty Girl was starting to make money, but I didn’t have children, so the ad agency didn’t really know the best way to sell me at first. There weren’t a lot of lifestyle brands buying online campaigns. I was getting pitched a lot of Pampers.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, audiences had turned to blogs to get away from the mainstream messages and commercialization. People cussed on their sites, or spoke candidly about controversial things. So to sanitize yourself to get advertising was anathema to the entire exercise.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>So what did you do?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of my background with editorial I thought, &#8220;Okay. What are advertisers looking for? They&#8217;re looking for a narrative. Right? What narrative could I provide that would let them give me money to write about whatever I want?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, I wrote up what I call a Life List, the less-morbid version of a bucket list. And that’s what I became known for. I spent a year and a half making decks and pitching, and there was some eye rolling from some of the salespeople I was working with. But eventually Intel picked me up as part of their Sponsors of Tomorrow campaign.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They sent me to swim with bioluminescent plankton in Puerto Rico, I was zip-lining, I was learning to roll in a kayak. It was all this super adrenal stuff, which if you know any writers, we’re people who like to sit in warm bathtubs with a cup of tea. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And in the time between coming up with the Life List idea and getting to execute it with sponsorship, I’d had a baby, which changed things.</span></p>\n<p><b>How so?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, before the Life List,  Mighty Girl was slowly making money, Mighty Goods was doing really well. I got a book deal to write </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No One Cares What You Had for Lunch: 101 Ideas for Your Blog</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And I was writing a regular sidebar for the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that featured unusual items for sale on eBay. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then one night my husband and I were going to dinner at a friend’s house, and he said, &#8220;We need to do some math. If we want two kids before you&#8217;re 36, we should have started trying by now.&#8221; I just went pale.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was thinking, &#8220;Oh my god. My career. I just won all of these awards, I have my book deal, my site is taking off,” I was at that dinner like, &#8220;Holy crap. It is time to get pregnant. It&#8217;s today.&#8221; </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I did. But being an entrepreneur and trying to be a primary parent blows. Babyhood is a very fleeting window. You want to be with your kids as much as they want to be with you, but work is always waiting.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was raised in the have-it-all generation. Now there’s that adage, “You can have it all. You just can&#8217;t have it all at the same time.&#8221; Well, actually you can, it’s just overwhelming and kind of crappy.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I always thought that I would re-enter the conventional workforce, but tech is so dominated by people in their 20s. There’s also a culture of hustling to make sure your value is noted by coworkers. And it&#8217;s difficult for them perceive that value if they haven’t felt the push-and-pull of a family life. I was like, &#8220;Man, I don&#8217;t want to be the person at the company who is doing less than the people around me, or even perceived to be doing less.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I always want to be the person doing the most, hustling hardest. And that amount of effort requires an unconventional schedule with kids in the mix.</span></p>\n<p><b>So you grew your own thing.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, I took on some partners and launched an events series that ran for five years. We had invite-only gatherings called Mighty Summits, and a more conventional conference called Camp Mighty. Eventually we founded Go Mighty, which is the community version of the Life List.</span></p>\n<p>And the premise of it from a business standpoint was that it was sort of like an ad network with a soul. We would bring in companies to sponsor influencer’s goals, and then often it would include a societal good component.</p>\n<p><b>Overall, what do you still feel are the most important things to you in your work? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is, obviously, the need to make a living so that you can eat and your children can eat. Beyond that, I’m motivated by people’s potential. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Connecting people with each other or with ideas, sparks a chain that creates good stuff in the world. I like to be a part of that.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I see technology as the most creative force available outside of the art world. The side of tech that still has my heart are the creative people who make things and build things, people who are globally curious. And getting to talk to those people and create things with them is awesome.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have monetary goals around health, education, and social justice. I’d like to raise $100K for each cause. Event attendees raised $80K for Charity Water, so we’re only $20K away from the health goal. Also, one of the goals with Go Mighty was to redirect $1 million in corporate advertising funds toward campaigns with social impact. So those things are still important to me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m interested in how advertising can become information, and also how we can tweak ad budgets to serve multiple purposes. I’m also thinking a lot about how we could automate systems to make it less work for people to donate money. We’re looking at such a huge income disparity, it’s time to start putting more of our best minds to solving that.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you think you got your hustle from?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was the first person in my family to graduate from college. My mom used to say, &#8220;If you liked it, no one would pay you to do it.&#8221; So it cracks me up that I’ve literally been paid to check things off of my Life List. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My father passed away when I was eight. My mother was very ill. She didn’t have traditional jobs open to her, because she couldn&#8217;t work nine-to-five reliably. So she had an antique stall, or when I was tiny, she had a newspaper route. She delivered 2,000 papers a day, and sometimes she would wake me up to go get warm donuts. Then she’d put me in the bed of the pick-up truck, and cover me with papers. I would sit in the back of the truck and throw newspapers out. That&#8217;s one of my nicest memories. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watching her make it work with the energy and resources she had was very motivational. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said, &#8220;If anybody&#8217;s ever paying you, they better see you working at all times. Don’t sit still. That&#8217;s how you lose a job.&#8221;</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Idea generation comes easily to me, so I value people who say, &#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s do it.&#8221;  I can sit in a room come up with 400 cool ideas, but at some point you need to get your bum in gear. And the bigger the plan, the more help you need.</span></p>\n<p><b>Within the lens of everything that you&#8217;ve talked about, how do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? Like, you&#8217;ve seen a couple  cycles, you probably see things repeat themselves in certain ways, and be different?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m curious to see whether there will be more of a verbal tradition, whether histories will start to be passed down and collected more, the way you’re doing here. It&#8217;s weird that tech doesn’t tend to respect experience, though it might be a byproduct of a time when older people hadn’t grown up with technology so didn’t know much about it.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you&#8217;re trying to innovate quickly, and fail quickly, experience is invaluable. Is that company a unicorn, or a horse with a horn glued to his forehead? Experience saves time and resources.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lessons that we’ve learned with other people&#8217;s money, with how we treat our communities, or people&#8217;s personal information, they’re often lost in these new endeavors. Everyone is too young to remember when the wheel was invented the first time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from that, I’m surprised that the industry is still so homogenous. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you have the relatively homogenous group of people building the future, the future is more of the same.  And I think we&#8217;ve collectively decided that&#8217;s not our jam, the future being more of the same.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, people are using the technologies provided by that legacy to make new things happen, and to connect with each other and shift things, so maybe it will work for users to meet creators halfway.</span></p>\n<p><b>What life goals you&#8217;re working on at the moment, either for work or personally?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had a difficult pregnancy, so I took a sabbatical to have this baby. It&#8217;s the first time in my life I haven&#8217;t been working. It&#8217;s strange, but it has been nice to have space to enjoy his babyhood. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’d like to do more interviews, and maybe a speaker series. For the first time in a long time working at a company again sounds appealing. The learning curve is there, and it would be cool to work with people who know more than me. </span></p>\n<p><b>My last question for you would be based on lessons that you&#8217;ve learned over time. What advice would you give to folks from similar backgrounds, maybe just chicks hoping to get into tech, based on what you&#8217;ve learned over time?</b><br />\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is power in being different. It makes you memorable and intriguing.</span></i> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People who don&#8217;t automatically recognize that probably aren’t people who you would have successful working relationships with anyway. I think it is much more to your advantage to be a woman in this field than it is to your disadvantage, if you can keep your morale up, and if you can learn to dismiss the people who dismiss you. You’ll have all the success you need just working with the people who see you.</span></p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>So tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Definitely! So I was born in Central Mexico to my parents and I am one of four children. And when I was around 8, my mother was diagnosed with cancer. So, she came to the United States to get treatment. She was also a migrant farm worker under amnesty;  it was a double blessing in disguise for her to be here. AA couple years later, we came as well. Because she was a permanent resident, she didn&#8217;t have the legal leverage to bring us legally even though we were her children. We came undocumented. Eventually, my mom, Mina, became a citizen and we thus became legal residents in the process. When I say here, I mean Redwood City, which is right, smack in the middle of Silicon Valley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t talk to many people who work in tech and who have grown up here poor. I think I just tweeted something around why people of low income backgrounds find it harder for to succeed in Silicon Valley. Yes, I grew up here,  I see have seen the changes, in the past decade or so. Yeah, I really loved growing up the Bay area. I call myself a Mexican-born, California-bred person. I don&#8217;t like the cold.</span></p>\n<p><b>How did you first get interested in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In high school, I took a computer science class. This was late 1990&#8217;s. The computer science class was really amazing. I was doing well. I was surprised. I took it just to say, &#8220;We&#8217;ll see, let me take this AP Computer Science class”. It ended up being that I really liked programming. I got a scholarship by a local engineering firm – Raychem to attend Berkeley.  The summer before my freshman year, I had my first internship in tech at Hewlett-Packard &#8211; at the age of 17.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I took an intro to computer science class but there wasn&#8217;t a lot of diversity. When I decided to change majors, my college advisor really didn&#8217;t push me to stay in engineering. But I wasn&#8217;t doing poorly and I wasn&#8217;t doing great, but I think about if I hadn’t stopped engineering, I would have been in a different path. Either way, my path came back to tech because my family lives in Silicon Valley. I went to grad school and I came back to the Bay Area and got a job in tech. It seems that everything was pushing me to be in tech. [laughter] I didn&#8217;t like that.</span></p>\n<p><b>So tell me more about what it was like growing up in the heart of Silicon Valley as a low-income, undocumented immigrant family. It&#8217;s a contrast from a lot of folks who grow up in the middle of this.</b></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s funny because I met someone that grew up in the peninsula and this person asked me where I grew up. Their second question was  “Are your parents venture capitalists?” [chuckles]. Which is so funny my parents being venture capital, my mom&#8217;s a single mom, my dad is still in Mexico. The contrast of what people think that my background is and and what the reality truly is.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I live in Redwood City, which is now the headquarters to Box and Evernote and bunch of other tech companies. When I was growing up, Redwood City was a very different place, it was predominantly Mexican. I remember one time—I worked at Stanford and I when someone asked me where I lived, they responded “That’s where all the nannies and gardeners live!” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A very drastic difference between the affluent Palo Alto and Redwood City. Palo Altowas home had a lot of traditional Silicon Valley &#8211; the Hewlett Packards of the world, the IBM&#8217;s, etcetera.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, back then, it  was a different Redwood City that exists now. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For me, I worked in Palo Alto in high school but living in a one-bedroom apartment with my whole family. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My whole family lived in a one-bedroom and there were six of us. Then my parents divorced. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We were then five; there were four children and my mom.</span></p>\n<p><b>How&#8217;s the rest of your family doing?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good, good. You know, my mom is amazing. She is one fierce woman. She has bought and maintains her own four-bedroom house. She is my inspiration, I love her. I have three healthy siblings, two beautiful little nieces. Our family is happy and stable—I think it&#8217;s because of my mother. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mother was the cornerstone and she is a thousand more amazing—more times amazing than any other woman out there that I know. Yeah, she&#8217;s doing great. I tried to stop by the other day to see her but she wasn&#8217;t there I was just too tired and I went home. I live a block away from her so that was easy…</span></p>\n<p><b>Okay, so let&#8217;s get into your work. You&#8217;ve had a really amazing career trajectory, like you&#8217;ve worked on very challenging projects for a lot of amazing companies. So tell me a bit about that.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like every one of my accomplishments and “successes” that has been published or spoken of, there are hundreds times where I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I lacked confidence early on. Then when I started at Twitter, I knew the power of Twitter, but I just didn&#8217;t know the impact of Twitter on my life. I look back and it was seven years ago &#8211; I can’t believe it!  I just really loved and continue to love, the product. Twitter was where my career and my passion for languages came together.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I came here when I was 10, I learned English within a year. I&#8217;m still friends with my teacher that taught me English! Then,  in high school, I learned French. In college I learned Portuguese, so by the time I was like 20, I had already learned three languages in less than ten years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love languages and I think that both having to work at all these tech companies, it kind of brings together my love for languages with technology, which I tell kids that technology will be one with their passion &#8211; you know, you want to be a zoologist, you want to be a doctor, you want to be a lawyer. All of these things will merge with technology because you&#8217;ll need to technology to work in these professions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that at Twitter, it was great having been part of the international team where my passion made an impact. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After I left. In 2013, I wrote a blog post about diversity in tech before all the numbers came out, before there was a lot of PR around it. When 2014 came around a lot of the diversity numbers came out, and they were abysmal as it relates to race and gender. But race and gender numbers came out, and everybody was shocked</span><b><i>. </i></b></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But to me, it wasn’t a shock because I&#8217;ve been in this industry forever.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then I was asked to be on numerous panels. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This one great panel, organized by USA Today, they wanted an entrepreneur that could be on a panel with the Reverend Jesse Jackson. They asked me, the heads of diversity from Facebook, Google, a Stanford law professor, and the reverend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The whole time, the conversations focused on implicit biases and unconscious biases. There was a lack of accountability. Everybody was talking about recruiting at this campus or going to Grace Hopper as a way to “fix” the issue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I thought to myself &#8211; that none of these program scaled. I thought to myself, &#8220;Well, why can&#8217;t we use technology to tackle and understand this issue.&#8221; That is how Atipica was born. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wanted to understand the pipeline and the recruiting funnel. Diverse applicants don&#8217;t have the networks where their resume gets pushed to the front of the line.  Therefore, their resume usually gets lost in the shuffle, part of the 75% of their resumes are never seen by the human eye. There might be biases if they look at it. Diverse applicants don’t assess themselves well. For example, I have applied for the wrong job, and  technology should have rerouted me to the right job. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve working on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The influence a name has on a resume. I often wonder, what is happening? How many diverse applicants are getting to their first interview or screening or whatever because of their name? At Atipica, we surface the applicants and interrupt biases &#8211; we don&#8217;t show names. In our product, we show just initials. We don&#8217;t show schools. We have worked a lot to interrupt pattern matching that occurs here in Silicon Valley, so that people can look beyond their implicit biases. </span></p>\n<p><b>Related to that, I&#8217;m curious to know, in your personal experience obviously you&#8217;ve had experiences that feed into the work that you do now. I&#8217;m curious to know of any sort of personal struggles that you&#8217;ve had, going into the industry, as someone from a different background, or someone who was potentially looked over for a job. Have you struggled in that way, yourself?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, so, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve had people tell me that because I am Latina, I shouldn&#8217;t wear dresses, inherently just because of my background. Me wearing a dress makes it seem more sexy than, let&#8217;s say, a non-Latina wearing a dress.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>Who would tell you that??</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Human resources. </span></p>\n<p><b>Wow.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s  a picture on the internet of me wearing a dress next to an ambassador, and it wasn&#8217;t like a short dress, it was a long dress, and it wasn&#8217;t tight, it was just like a nice, professional dress. But either way, I was oversexualized because I am Latina. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diversity and inclusion comes in two parts &#8211; there’s diversity and there&#8217;s inclusion. In early stage startups, the environments may not be very diverse &#8211; but can be inclusive. At Twitter, I felt the leaders were very inclusive and my colleagues were as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally, as a Latina woman, I don&#8217;t just hit the glass ceiling, I  also hit the glass door and the glass wall because—if I lean in, people are going to think I&#8217;m feisty and stuffI don&#8217;t have the ability to do other things that other non-POC women might do. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve witnessed a lot of uncomfortable situations coming from people in power and especially the lack of recognition by people that are in a privileged position. I have been in horribly uncomfortable situations that are illegal. Unfortunately, years ago, I decided which battles to pick and none of them were big enough to “burn” bridges. The situation is different now and I admire those women who are holding the industry accountable for their sexism and harassment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I mentor other women and I advice them to stand up without alienating people &#8211; because I had to learn the hard way. When I mentored other women I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to tell you everything that happened to me so you do not do the same and maybe I can show you how to tackle this injustice.&#8221; There is one woman that was a friend of mine. She was on maternity leave from a tech company and they stopped vesting her shares during maternity leave.</span></p>\n<p><b>Really?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. Oh my God. I guided her and told her to stay lit bit; she ended there for another couple years. She recently left for a better position at another startup. She negotiated that too. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There a lot of lessons I learned the hard way. It’s been years now since a lot of these things happened to me. Early in my career, it was really, really hard working in tech. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have let go and I&#8217;m hopeful something came out of it &#8211; for the new generation of young girls joining this industry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, being an entrepreneur is another whole different story. It’s not this “death by a thousand papercuts” as much as it was working for tech five years ago [laughter]. Entrepreneurship, at least, is very transparent. They either invest in you or not. They may have their biases, they may not, blah blah. But there are hundreds of investors, if not thousands. Whereas, working for a tech company right now is, there are two paths &#8211; you stay there or not.  So if there is something that&#8217;s not right, what are the paths you can take? As an entrepreneur, you have many numerous paths to take if that were to happen.</span></p>\n<p><b>Did you have mentors at any point in your career or did you just forged your own path?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I remember a very high profile woman I worked with. She recommended that I get a mentor, and I thought. A mentor is someone you convince to be your professional friend and rely on them. But as I saw great leaders, I understood the importance of mentors. The first Twitter employee, Crystal, did a lot to help me grow professionally.I always say that she was sort of like an unofficial mentor of mine. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an entrepreneur, I now realize now that mentors that come in different packages, male, female. There&#8217;s people that are on the venture front, there&#8217;s peer mentors that are entrepreneurs, there&#8217;s my female mentors that have much more experiences like mine. Mentorship doesn&#8217;t have to be this consistent thing, it just has to a reality. For example, I know a VC &#8211;  I can email him anything and he will respond within half a day, and be like, &#8220;What do you need,&#8221; etc. I consider him a mentor, but he might not think himself as one, and I consider my friend a peer mentor—she&#8217;s a female entrepreneur who has raised capital. I think it&#8217;s never too late to find  “mentors” in your support circle. </span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m curious to know your biggest motivators that got you through everything. </b></p>\n<p>My motivators are my family and my close friends who answer my text when I’m going through through the valley of despair.&#8221;Which all entrepreneurs go through. It&#8217;s like, &#8221;What the heck am I doing? will anything ever look up?”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But my biggest motivators are  young people that email me or come up to me after a talk. I try to do more speaking engagements to young people than I do to adults. I have gotten these amazing messages from young people that either saw my stories or read something about me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of them is actually my mentee now. He read something on USA Today and now he is part of my life. Even when I am doubting myself, these young people believe in me. A few years ago, I traveled a lot and spoke to youth in Latin America. They were so taken back by my experience &#8221;Whoa. You know you&#8217;re a Latina over there&#8230;&#8221; It is the youth, the next generation of game changers that are my motivators. Because, when they get to be my age, they can see themselves represented in this industry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I often tell young, Latino youth that tech is creating this immense amount of wealth. Right now Mark Zuckerberg is the sixth richest man. </span></p>\n<p><b><i>Tech is creating immense amounts of wealth, but  it&#8217;s not creating wealth for our communities and it&#8217;s definitely not creating wealth for our future generations</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. We need to be successful, create that wealth so that we can give back. In sum, I think my biggest motivators have always been the people on the outside that see themselves in me. I think that has always been my drive —even when I get sad, I read the emails these young kids have sent me, and it motivates me to get back up.</span></p>\n<p><b>We touched on this a little bit earlier the kind of 2009 versus 2016, but how do you feel about the state of the industry in 2016—what are you really excited about, and what would you really like to see change?</b></p>\n<p>I think the industry are having tough conversations with themselves. They need to see the monster they created and talk to see how they can move forward. There are going to be uncomfortable situations. We are facing this accountability crisis. People think, we should call others out, you know, on social media….we should like, blast them!</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m like, “I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s the most productive way” but if that&#8217;s the way you want to handle a lot of the discussions, then go for it. At least we are having the tough conversations &#8211; regardless of the medium &#8211; then the healing will begin.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in five or ten years? Do you think you&#8217;ll still be in tech in Silicon Valley?</b></p>\n<p>I&#8217;d love to have a restaurant, I love to cook. [laughter] I&#8217;ll have a restaurant in Silicon Valley. I think so, and I&#8217;m hoping that I have built a company that is inclusive, diverse—I think Biz Stone, who is the co-founder of Twitter always said, &#8220;Twitter was not the triumph of technology, is was a triumph of humanity.&#8221;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Atipica will be the triumph of humanity &#8211; but not relying on a sheet of paper to define talent and job compatibility. I&#8217;m hoping that people that don&#8217;t know how to write a resume will be able to say, &#8220;Hey, I can learn.&#8221;  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m hopeful that a lot of the startups that I advise right now grow to be successful businesses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8216;m hopeful that these numbers don&#8217;t stay the same; I&#8217;m certainly hopeful that Latinas are represented in a bigger number than we are now, especially  in product and engineering. I do think that this will be slow, as much as I love this industry, it’s an industry that has a long ways to it might not be 5 or 10 years…. it might take another couple generations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I&#8217;m hopeful by the time my grandchildren are grown, it won’t be something like this. But this is not all; I do think that everyone needs to combine their passion with what they do. I&#8217;m hoping that one day I&#8217;ll have a Youtube channel where I show my recipes [chuckles] and to continue with my hobbies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is my home—Silicon Valley is my home. Tech has been my passion, my career, and I can’t leave it completely. I don&#8217;t think that you can ever leave something.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example I downloaded a meditation app, and it seemed like a good concept, but I didn&#8217;t like the UX. Part of my tech eye is always going to be on &#8211; how I utilize tech to improve myself, and improve others, improve the industry.</span></p>\n<p><b>As closing I am curious to know what advice or lessons or just tips and tricks would you give folks from similar backgrounds to you that are hoping to get into tech but may not feel so encouraged.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Open up your networks.  You&#8217;re gonna get rejected—I got rejected after Twitter. What do I do next? I thought to myself. Keep asking. Keep asking. That&#8217;s the only way- because other people with privilege and access to networks are asking their friends all the time.  Someone from Stanford gets recruited by Facebook or goes to work at Google or someone leaves Google to go work at uber, those networks are going to perpetuate themselves to sameness. For us, we need  to hack the network.</span></p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>So, I would love to start with the beginning. Tell me a bit about your earliest years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born in Washington, D.C. Both of my parents migrated from the middle of the country to an urban center, because they had to escape their sort of tough rural backgrounds. My parents were working middle class people, educated through high school but aspiring for more, and in Washington they could have white collar jobs. I went to public schools in DC and I loved growing up there because I just got a great sense of history and news in the making – all that sort of thing. [Washington] was to a degree integrated [at that time], lots of international people were there, and obviously lots of African-Americans. Looking back I&#8217;m really glad I had that [experience growing up]. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My first aware career aspiration was to be an artist [chuckles] – I meant like with a beret and a smock and palette, you know? </span><em>I had no real career sense of anything about professional life, but my parents always said—because they were working class—&#8221;You have to work and support yourself, no matter what.&#8221; So that was a given. &#8220;We don&#8217;t care what else you do, but you&#8217;re going to work and have a job.&#8221; </em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I graduated from high school in 1969. In other words, I was a hippie. There were various cultures at my high school, but hippies were definitely a big contingent, and that was the easiest one for me, because I was not ever a girly girl, I was not ever into dating, so that was just the group that suited me and vice versa, I think. My parents were church-going people, and [they sent me to] a little Lutheran college in Ohio, which they strongly preferred. I thought of myself as an urban person, but I ended up actually loving my experience there. The school is called Wittenberg. It&#8217;s one of like 10,000 liberal arts schools in Ohio [chuckles]. And I made lifelong friends there, I had wonderful teachers. But, again, no big career plan. I studied what I wanted to study – all liberal arts. It was humanities all the way – lots of literature, lots of history, art history. </span><em>My mom had insisted I learn typing in high school, so I had typing too, and that has been my life ever since, really.</em></p>\n<p>My dad died when I was a senior in college. Without a clear plan, I moved back to my mom&#8217;s in the Maryland suburbs and got jobs in Washington for a couple years, and went to graduate school then, [once] again in American Studies. So I have two degrees in American Studies. I was in a Smithsonian program, studied material culture and folklore and things like that. I enjoyed that, and I also worked at the same time. That&#8217;s how I paid my tuition, by working at George Washington University.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was now a young professional adult with young adult friends. Still didn&#8217;t have any particular plan, I held office jobs, and I was smart, and I could type, and I could read, and I just had a series of those kind of jobs. In graduate school, I studied oral history, and I happened to be at school at a time when a couple of local professors uncovered what had been missing for 40 years, the archives of the Federal Theatre Project, which was part of the WPA [Works Progress Administration]. There were just trunks and trunks of material that the Library Congress owned and had misplaced. These two found it, and got a big grant to catalog it all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So thanks to my graduate work, I actually had a job in my field, which is to say I became the oral historian for their [FTP cataloging] project for two years. And that led me to do what you&#8217;re doing now, which is travel around the country and interview people who had worked for the WPA Theatre Project, when I was 25 or 26.</span></p>\n<p><b>What a dream.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I loved that because I knew the material very well. The [interviewees] were all charming theater people, by and large. They included people like &#8211; these are names that may not mean anything to you – Joseph Cotten, Arlene Francis, people who later became big stars. And so that was fantastic. [This project] didn&#8217;t really lead anywhere, and I knew that. I remember [thinking] that I didn&#8217;t really feel like an academic career. Some of my graduate school friends pursued going further into the field of oral history and historical projects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I felt like, I don&#8217;t want to get further away from the real world, because I was already so in my head. I didn&#8217;t want to get a PhD, I thought a master&#8217;s degree was plenty. Anyway, I enjoyed that period—it was couple of years—but the [FTP] grant money was coming to an end and the project was more or less done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again with no clear plan, I had met a guy and he didn&#8217;t have a big plan either, and Ronald Reagan had been elected, and was coming into office. </span>This was 1979, and I said, &#8220;I cannot live in Washington under Ronald Reagan,&#8221; so we moved West – but we had no plan.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We took four months to drive across the country. We did end up in San Francisco where we had friends, but when you&#8217;re in your late 20s, nobody has really a stable place to live for long-term visitors who come and hang out with you while they&#8217;re looking for jobs. We were a little intimidated at the time, and ended up going up to Oregon, where I had another friend. [Eventually] I did get a job in Portland, and and [ended up] stayed there five years. I worked on an oral history project that had to do with women shipyard workers [during World War II] in the Pacific Northwest. It paid like five cents. It was a side thing, but it was still interesting. I also had a job in a little non-profit, a membership group of independent filmmakers, because I was interested in media. This was basically like an office job, running a little membership organization, I think there were two and half people on the payroll [laughs], including me. As a result of doing that for a couple years, I met somebody at a conference who said, &#8220;There&#8217;s a job in San Francisco. You should apply for it. It&#8217;s a bigger organization.&#8221; And much as I loved the Northwest, Portland was extremely depressed in the 80s, had no real economy. It was a pretty run-down place, charming, but it wasn&#8217;t big enough [for me].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, I did apply for this job and I got it. And it was [with] an organization called Media Alliance, which had a lot of progressive media types, and [also] people who were moving to the Bay Area looking for jobs. So, I took the job. It wasn&#8217;t that enjoyable [thin margins!], but on the board of directors of this organization was a guy named David Bunnell who started </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PC Magazine</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and then </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PC World</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> magazine. Now, he was a quirky guy, kind of nerdy, kind of shy, a bit of a weird character. But he took a liking to me and talked to me very readily, where he didn&#8217;t talk to a lot of people. After about a year at Media Alliance, he said, &#8220;I want to hire you.&#8221; He was running a computer publishing company in this heyday of thousands of computer magazines. The beginning of personal computing. I said, &#8220;But I don&#8217;t know anything.&#8221; I used a K-Pro! But he felt comfortable with me, and I was going to be his conduit to the real world, is what I realized after I got there. Going there doubled my pay –  stability at last. And I loved the people.</span> I remember thinking in 1985, &#8220;How is it that there&#8217;s a world with all this jargon, all this lingo, that a world of these magazines, I barely understood what they were talking about. These trade shows, like Comdex. How has this sprung up so quickly out of nowhere? Where did this come from?&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>All the people in [computer publishing] at that time, nobody that I knew was really experienced at it. Everybody was new and young and getting into it – but we were really smart, bookish, funny people and so, I just loved it. I just loved learning about magazines, I loved putting them together, and having a regular schedule, and working with people who were funny and were making fun of technology as they were working on it. It just suited me perfectly. And that&#8217;s how I fell into technology. </em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I stayed there four years, and I was David&#8217;s right hand. We started a little R&amp;D group. I worked a lot with the editors of the different magazines. Again, now I have life-long friends from that experience. </span></p>\n<p>Eventually, he left because his contract ended. I, again, didn&#8217;t really have a plan, but by then, I knew people, and so, I got a contract for about a year to start a new technical journal for Addison Wesley, a book publisher. They’d never done a periodical, and I had a strange experience dealing with mathematician Steven Wolfram (the journal was about his program Mathematica). Once again, I just sort of felt my way. But now, I began to have a network of people who work here and there and who knows things about  publishing and who knew things about technical stuff. It just led to different—sometimes freelance—jobs. I think I had a freelance period there for a while where I was writing and editing.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We&#8217;re in the early &#8217;90s now, and I had a job at an awful technology PR firm, one of the early ones. I didn&#8217;t like doing PR, but I liked the people that I worked with. </span>That led to a job at a very hot startup called 3DO – and my first IPO. I had friends who’d already been through IPOs, and I was determined to be in one too. [3DO] was a big hit for 20 minutes<b>.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> But again, I met good people there. That&#8217;s where I first met Omid Kordestani, was at 3DO. Again my network grew because everybody I knew was doing the same thing: You&#8217;d move here, you&#8217;d move there, you&#8217;d have a new job, you&#8217;d try something out, [you’d make friends along the way]. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After 3DO, I had a couple more years of freelance work. By now my editorial friends were editors of different magazines. So </span><em>as the web came online, I was invited to put together one of the first consumer guides to the web. It&#8217;s so antique now. I should show it to you. It has lots of spider and web puns in it, it&#8217;s just ridiculous [chuckles]. It came out in 1995. I didn&#8217;t get a lot of money for it, but it led to my editorial friends inviting me to review LOTS of websites for their publications. </em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I did that for a couple of years, writing up consumery-type things for tech. I was never really particularly technical, but I knew how to explain the value to [consumer readers]. And then I joined this startup a friend of mine had got going called Planet Out. It was really the early gay portal. My friend [Tom Rielly] is a great character, and he had this vision of this web and AOL portal that would be news and information for the gay community. I was the executive editor, assigning stories and hiring writers. It was great. But it did not do well as a startup. I left and went back to the magazine side – [I became] the executive editor of Upside [a hot monthly mag then].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My whole mantra during this period was, I can work in these kind of corporate climates if I feel like I&#8217;m providing useful information, or it&#8217;s something that people can use. I can remember when I joined IDG,  the parent company of the first computer magazines, I remember thinking, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s not Bechtel.&#8221; I mean, [IDG] has a public value. They have a usefulness to people. And that&#8217;s what I cared about. And that, I think, has been a guiding thing for me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upside was interesting, because it was about the business of technology, which has become a really interesting area. I liked having a big role at a magazine, where I worked with a lot of writers. I knew I was a good editor, and that made me a better editor, to be working with good writers, and to have back-and-forth conversations about what they were trying to do. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I stayed 18 months, but it was just a bad atmosphere, so I pivoted then. I thought, &#8221; if the web is going to be a big thing, I love information and words and ideas, so how now, since we don&#8217;t have to be linear anymore, and we&#8217;re not limited by a page, the size of a book, the size of a magazine, how then to present information and make it discoverable?&#8221; </span>There was a thing then called information design, which now has morphed into UX and content strategy.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I had friends at an early web design firm [Studio Archetype] that were really getting into this in a deep way. They kept saying, &#8220;You should come over.&#8221; I did go, where I managed teams who did that, [and in the process, I gained an] understanding of business development; what is content strategy; how to take somebody&#8217;s corporate information, business information and make it useful online, chunk it up and all that sort of thing. Again, I loved the people there. Really fantastic group. It was a great company, but it wasn&#8217;t particularly financially successful, because there was a lot of overhead. So they ended up selling to a much bigger systems integrator [Sapient].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that [integration] was fascinating to go through, because we were a little artsy design studio, and here came this much bigger [entity]. [Sapient] was a consulting business [which plugged people into long-term projects like this: &#8220;You&#8217;re an engineer with three years of C++, you&#8217;re going to Dallas for two months” or whatever it was. They couldn&#8217;t really figure out how to plug in the creative people. And the creative people mostly revolted, of course, but again, the process of going through an integration that didn&#8217;t work well was pretty great. And led me to understand why acquisitions often don&#8217;t work [laughter].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Somewhere in here, </span><em>one of my old friends I had worked with at two companies, I kept in touch with her. In 1999 she said, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m taking a new job at this startup. It&#8217;s called Google, come visit some time.&#8221;</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So I kept in touch, I visited her a couple of times around 2000. The way I understood search [on the early web] was that one of my writing assignments was to compare search engines, and there were tons of them before Google. So, I had looked at them and tried different search terms and stuff. When it came to Google, it was instantly </span><b>so</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> much better than all the others. Many orders of magnitude better. It occurred to me a couple of times that I should call her, because I was still freelancing here and there. But I thought, that&#8217;s a long commute. Much to my regret!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The big tech crash happened in 2000. I was at a little startup that folded. It was tough then for, I don&#8217;t know, close to two years [because jobs dried up]. So I was freelancing, but my income had really dropped – and I had bought my first home. Eventually I called my friend at Google and said, &#8220;Hey, you have any freelance work?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Oh, we just hired a marketing writer, but I&#8217;ll keep you in mind.&#8221; And she called back, maybe a couple of months later, and said, &#8220;You know what, we&#8217;re really slammed, so come in to meet some people.&#8221; So I went down, and they were really nice. They said, &#8220;When can you start?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Right away.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I started out as a marketing writer on contract to Google in 2002. Right away, I liked the people, and I believed in what they were doing. I [remember thinking], &#8220;This is in close alignment with my values. They&#8217;re helping people find information, it&#8217;s a service that is useful.&#8221; And of course, they had that great mission statement. So, I just started telling people there: I want to work here, I want to work here, I want to work here. By this time, I was enough of a utilitarian writer and editor – I could take copy and turn it into something good quickly, so I just made myself as indispensable as I could around the office. And I tried to be enough of a fixture that people would say, &#8220;She&#8217;s one of us,&#8221; It  took more than a year. Eventually, I did get hired on to be full-time. I was 50 or 51 when I got hired there. By then, I&#8217;d had this long, tough stretch where I was not earning enough, and so I just was so grateful to get in. I remember thinking, &#8220;Please, God, don&#8217;t let them have an IPO until after I get in!” And they didn&#8217;t. (It took another year after I joined.) I just made my way in the communications team&#8230; I knew enough about how PR worked, there was no confusing me with a flack, and everybody understood I had this different role. Google was small enough and young enough that there were lots of things that hadn&#8217;t been identified that just popped up. I think that formed a lot of my experience. </span></p>\n<p><em>My view now is you just have to try things, and you can&#8217;t get hung up by the job description. You can&#8217;t get hung up by the title. You have to get in there and see what happens.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In a place like Google at that time, that&#8217;s perfect, because it was not at all tamped down, it was kind of messy, and a lot of things needed doing. You were encouraged to try different things. I learned how to navigate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, Google was growing up, getting bigger, but because I&#8217;d been there early enough, I became sort of part of the furniture and a little bit of an old hand, in all the best ways. The team grew up. What I did became more specialized, or I became known for a couple things. One was managing the original Google blog, which it turns out to have been an early company blog, at a time when companies didn&#8217;t do that very much. Google was different enough that it did. Then, all around Google, everybody wanted their own [blog] for their product and their country. So, I codified what the rules would be about how to do that – and then for a few years, people wanted me to talk about this, because they were fascinated by Google, but also wanted to publish company news on a blog. [Other places] were navigating complexity with lawyers, who didn&#8217;t want them to do this sort of thing. I had done it, and it worked pretty well. It worked pretty well because Google people had flexible minds about this sort of thing. They weren’t hidebound and that really helped. </span></p>\n<p><em>In 2009 I had been watching Twitter. I knew the Twitter guys, and I thought, “Google has to be on Twitter.” I made a case for it internally, but initially people said, “we don&#8217;t need another channel for our news.” I said, “Twitter has attracted lots of techies, including reporters. We need to be there. I&#8217;ll do it.” They said, “that&#8217;s good, because we don&#8217;t have any headcount.” I said, “you don&#8217;t need headcount. I can do this.”</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I brought them around. [My thought was] this is a layer of an audience that you don&#8217;t get another way. I still believe that about Twitter. You raise your [visibility] and reach more people. So, </span><em>I became known for bringing @Google onto @Twitter – which is ultimately what led me to getting a job at Twitter.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Because at that time Twitter was like a younger company that had not codified this stuff. They hadn&#8217;t really thought it through. So I came in to do this and embroider lots of things related to it. There was an atmosphere of, &#8220;we&#8217;ve never really done that,&#8221; or, &#8220;We do it a different way,&#8221; or, &#8220;That sort of fell off the radar, so we don&#8217;t know.&#8221; Now I say, &#8220;Well I have an idea. Let&#8217;s try it and see.&#8221; I just think my lack of [having a plan ahead of time] has saved me a lot of ulcers. I tell people who are sometimes a lot younger, who get super hung up on the trappings, or what it says on the page about the thing, or what the original was: &#8220;Well, it can change. It can change. Just relax. If it&#8217;s not tenable, it&#8217;s not tenable. But let&#8217;s find out.&#8221; I think that&#8217;s just been my approach, &#8220;It can&#8217;t hurt you to find out.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><b>How have you seen tech evolve and change over the years? </b></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s just so much easier to do things now, right? You used to have to have floppy disks. The idea of the amount of space they have for anything is just—everything was just bigger and slower.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I remember even when I was at IDG the computer magazine company, I had a contemporary Macintosh, but there were networking problems. And I guess we were all on just a local area network, I&#8217;m guessing, because it was before the internet really took off. And I remember I had my little phone address book and I had a post-it list, every day, a list of people I needed to call, and I would call people on my phone – which I don&#8217;t do anymore at all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So in a certain way, </span>it&#8217;s astonishing how much tech has changed in not very much time.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I remember when I got into the Mathematica project. These were academics, right? And they were at universities like Princeton. And I remember talking to some of them about articles, and [at a time when] there were all kinds of weird publishing systems where you were submitting to ftp [sites] and all this stuff. </span></p>\n<p>I remember [asking] this guy, what&#8217;s your email address and he said so and so at princeton.edu. I&#8217;m like, that doesn&#8217;t make any sense. What service are you on – MCI Mail, are you on CompuServe – you can&#8217;t just have <i>an address</i>.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> [laughter] What are you talking about? Of course, they had addresses, right, because [academic email] had come out of DARPA. They just had [email] addresses. That&#8217;s what we were all going to be getting [instead of subscribing to one closed service or another]. I didn&#8217;t understand that for a while. I had every account for the longest time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Macworld</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we had an early project – we were trying to figure out how to put </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Macworld </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">magazine online using GE’s AppleLink, and we were asking, is there a way to turn off the meter so people see the ads but they&#8217;re not being charged for the ads, because it was like 35 dollars an hour to have access over that kind of network. That was like 25 years ago. It&#8217;s not that long. It feels ancient but it&#8217;s really not. It&#8217;s kind of astonishing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So it&#8217;s changed in a ton of ways. </span>I’ve lived in my place for 16 years. When we moved in, we threaded CAT5 cable throughout the house, and there are Ethernet ports in every room. But I haven&#8217;t used Ethernet in five years or more.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Now I have Nest thermostats and Nest smoke detectors, and things like that. </span></p>\n<p><em>You can&#8217;t fathom it in a certain way, you can’t believe it&#8217;s happened that fast. Even though we&#8217;re in a bubble here, it doesn&#8217;t just touch an exclusive population in the Bay Area. [Internet access] has become ubiquitous and important for everybody; that&#8217;s the most fascinating thing.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the Internet turned commercial and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wired</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> magazine started, I still remember Louis Rossetto&#8217;s opening essay, &#8220;There&#8217;s this giant tsunami of technology information coming our way, in a good way. We welcome it.&#8221; He started a category of publishing that still exists today. [But] we don&#8217;t need the kind computer magazines we used to have, they&#8217;re all dead. Can&#8217;t even find them online in some cases. But you know what? It doesn&#8217;t matter. I have some paper copies, it doesn&#8217;t really matter. It&#8217;s more like having some understanding of how it&#8217;s all come along. And I laugh because</span><em> I&#8217;m just as impatient as anybody else now — like I can&#8217;t get a signal, I can&#8217;t get wifi – I don&#8217;t stop and think, &#8220;This is so great to have it [at all].”</em></p>\n<p><b>How does it feel to have such a depth of knowledge and experience, and be surrounded by so many young, enthusiastic folks who are super brilliant, but have no context for what they&#8217;re in?</b></p>\n<p><em>I wish they cared more about how fast [technology development] has come up, and I wish they cared more about history. But they don&#8217;t. I think that&#8217;s more or less the nature of people. You don&#8217;t really care that much about the past. I like history and I like understanding the relationship between past and present, but I don&#8217;t think a lot of people do. Now people are completely tuned into the world of today. I do sometimes wish people understood how miraculous it all is in a certain way. But they don&#8217;t. We start from where we are.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I made friends at Google who were engineers, younger than me, but [of course] way more technical. It&#8217;s fun to see them and geek out with them about how things were [even in the early days of Google]. Honestly, even a few years ago—I mean I&#8217;m friendly with one of the early early early engineers at Google, who was like employee number eight. He and I used to print out like raw pages of the Google search index every month to figure out the original Google Zeitgeist – which we would publish monthly!  So we would take the printout—just search terms that people had put in, and we tried to come up with interesting patterns for music themes, or sports, or holidays, or whatever it was. I&#8217;d print out like 50 pages and we&#8217;d go through with a yellow highlighter. That is primitive, right? And that was not even 15 years ago. Anyway, it&#8217;s fun to think about. You just pick who you can [to remember] about that stuff who also has an appreciation of it.</span></p>\n<p><b>What has become most important to you in your work over time? How does what you want in a job now differ from what you wanted earlier in your career?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m from a one step removed from blue collar background, speaking of my parents and how I grew up. People had [to work]. You didn&#8217;t think about quality of life [chuckles] or [larger] aspirations. My roots are in that. Obviously, over time I </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cared [about quality of jobs], I have quit jobs I didn&#8217;t like and easily got other ones many times over the years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I have had more expectation about what I did want, and I guess the biggest driver for me, thinking back to our last conversation, is probably [paying attention to] what a company does. Right? What the business is or the industry, that does matter to me. That has become important, like thinking about working somewhere that provides educational information, useful information, that has sort of a public service to it. Which I think [both] Google and Twitter do. I&#8217;d have a harder time working in many industries&#8230;even in technology, it would be much more of a stretch for me to work for a company that made some piece of hardware that was a peripheral or something. </span><em>I like being attached to something that has a public good and a public value. And frankly, that is world-changing.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I think that has determined for me, maybe for the last 20 or 25 years, some aspect of what I&#8217;m doing for a living. It&#8217;s lucky that I landed in those places, in order to form that thought. I could have gone down other roads, and that part seems like happenstance. But, then once I got into this [technology] world, this is an important driver to me. I couldn&#8217;t go be the editorial director or creative director at Coca-Cola, or an insurance company, or something.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are your biggest motivators? What drives you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One is the mission, or the cause, behind the business. And, by the way, much to my surprise, like working for a for-profit business. I wouldn&#8217;t have expected that of myself. I had my earlier years were non-profit and educational institutions. I just feel like this is where stuff is being sorted out that affects so many more people. </span></p>\n<p><em>I think besides the sort of mission of the business has, working with smart and creative people whose skills are varied, a mix of races and countries and backgrounds – a rich mix of people is a big motivator [for me]. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d like being somewhere where conformity was valued or where people had to really tow the party line.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I just read an item today about how Time Inc. made a business-sized card now for Time Inc. employees to carry in their wallets about the mission of Time Inc. Right? Because Time has been through a lot of turmoil in the last few years – and that will continue – and it’s very funny that that&#8217;s how they want to have an incentive for people to care about what they&#8217;re doing. I don’t think that I’d go for that either. And not a big legacy business. I need the more modern, the more—things are changing </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">right now</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> kind of contemporary.</span></p>\n<p><b>How have you seen Silicon Valley and its culture evolve and change since your earlier years in the industry?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, the biggest thing by far, by far, is just the influence of the idea of this place called Silicon Valley on the world. Where I came into it when it was about the power of the personal computer, and that certainly was a powerful thing, to get away from the priesthood of the mainframes and all that. Putting the power of publishing and ideas and creativity in people&#8217;s hands – that was the beginning. [Since then] we’ve taken giant leaps forward from the beige plastic thing on the desk. Technology is now so much more pervasive in everything in the developed world and even, frankly, in the developing world, in terms of mobile devices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wired</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> magazine launched, Louis Rossetto wrote this opening about how we&#8217;re in this era that’s equivalent to discovering fire. It was that dramatic. I understood it then, and he was right. But now I feel like you just can&#8217;t explain the world, a lot you can&#8217;t do or understand or explain without some part of this world of technology that has developed in Silicon Valley. And obviously not only physically here – this is a notional place. And I&#8217;m in the middle of it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the years I&#8217;ve had to host any number of delegations and tour groups – I think I was mentioning this last time – from around the world, who want to see Google, they want to see Twitter, they go visit Facebook, they want to see Apple. They want to understand Stanford, they want to understand this place and what it looks like, what people are doing, and how they might have it where they live in some way. And they mean the physical spaces and the offices, but they also mean the intellectual heft and the money and the dynamism to build great new things and have the ability to fail and like all of that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mostly, in a certain way, they can&#8217;t. If it&#8217;s like a government ministry wants that, they really cannot do that [governments can’t mandate innovation]. Some of it is about a free market, some is demographics and education levels, and all these things. But they want it because it represents so much success and promise and all the wondrous things coming out of it. I admit I like being in it and not in a sort of pale version of it. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, I do feel like [what Silicon Valley has produced] has changed the world. Probably within the last 10 years, my totally non-technical friends, people who work for nonprofits, are social workers, teachers, completely not connected to this world or even actively disliked either business or technology – they all got mobile phones, and typically got on Facebook, have an iPad or use FaceTime, or maybe their office moved to the cloud or they use Amazon…. They look at me like, &#8220;You&#8217;re at the sharp end of this thing. You were there first, you know all this stuff; how did you know that this would turn out to be this way? We&#8217;re coming into it late.&#8221;  Of course I didn&#8217;t know, but ended up being in the swim early. Now it’s such a given that people are using devices and services, technologies that none of us dreamed of ten years ago, in a mass market.</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m curious to know if you&#8217;ve had mentors or people you&#8217;ve looked up to for inspiration? Or even people who were really pivotal in your path to where you are today?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, the most direct one I can point to was the guy who hired me to work at IDG at PCWorld and Macworld magazines. He came, himself, from a publishing background, as in a small town newspaper in Nebraska. And he&#8217;d stumbled into these early computer magazines. His name is David Bunnell. He lives in Berkeley. And he was the guy who was my board member when I was at a non-profit who hired me away to come to IDG. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There couldn&#8217;t have been a more stark &#8220;I&#8217;m going to show you this new world and change your life,&#8221;  but that is what happened. That was a turn in the road. So he was a mentor in that he made me feel like I could fit in and learn all this stuff where it was a totally foreign world to me. He made it seem like, &#8220;It&#8217;s no big deal and I like you and have faith in you and you&#8217;re fitting in. It&#8217;s all going to be fine.&#8221; That was the kind of mentoring he did. &#8220;Come along for the ride with me.&#8221; That&#8217;s probably the biggest, clearest marker in my life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then another one for me would probably be my friend, Tom Rielly, who now is the director of the TED Fellows program for the TED conferences. He&#8217;s worked for TED for ten or more years in New York, but I&#8217;ve known him from my early days at the IDG magazines, simply because we had mutual friends, and eventually met, because of that. He was a nerdy young man, younger than I am. He was a classic early adopter. He worked for some of the early Macintosh companies as a marketer. He was always out in front of all that stuff, and I just watched him and hung around with him. It was so much a part of his nature and his style. He&#8217;s a natural marketer, and he&#8217;s a very infectious person. He&#8217;s smart, and he&#8217;s funny, and you want to go along wherever he  is going. That was almost 25 years ago. He had a circle of friends, almost all of them were younger than me. But again, there was no sense of, &#8220;You can’t be here. You can&#8217;t come in.&#8221; I think that it was fun. It was fun to geek out, to get the latest thing and wait in line at Macworld or the Apple Store when the that eventually came along. Now looking back, it reminds me when I was a young teenager I was early into the Beatles. We would go to the record store on Tuesdays when the new shipment of records came in and I was among the first to get the albums. [chuckles] It&#8217;s not that different from waiting in line at the Apple Store or to put in your order which I&#8217;ve done at 12:01 am when something new is available. </span></p>\n<p><b>Did you have have support networks in place early in your career, and where do you find them now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not in any formal, professional way. No, I really didn&#8217;t. I just had friends. Now I know I&#8217;m a natural networker and connector. And I think I just had friends here and there that I liked wherever I worked and so on. </span><em>There were older businesswomen, but they weren&#8217;t like me. I was a misfit to a certain extent, and I&#8217;m a bit of an outsider. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I didn&#8217;t see myself having sort of a straight job where I could go to the next level in the marketing organization or something like that. So no, I had an informal network, which is very important – we were all sort of making our way here and there in kind of roughly parallel paths. The fact is I was older than a lot of them, it turned out, in the technology world. That didn’t matter as much as over time, I found that I had among my friends people I looked on as a brain trust – who I could get advice from about office politics, or which companies were better, or the way to cast my own role or something like that. But it was just kind of a situational grid of people more than any kind of model or mentor.</span></p>\n<p><b>Did you work alongside many women earlier in your career? Where have you seen them go?</b></p>\n<p>I have worked alongside women since my time in San Francisco began, which is now 31 years, yes. Typically again we’ve been in sort of parallel-ish roles because the higher you go the fewer women executives there are, that’s certainly still true in technology with a few exceptions. I&#8217;m in an odd position because of what I&#8217;ve always been interested in doing – not business side operations meaning sales, or finance, or that sort of thing. And I&#8217;m not technical, but neither am I HR, or PR strictly speaking which would have been traditionally women&#8217;s roles. Right? I&#8217;ve been in in-between positions. But I&#8217;ve always had women friends certainly, and women colleagues scattered throughout in related roles. At Twitter, for example, I have a good friend in consumer marketing, a different team, but, we certainly are each other’s support system and are professionally aligned even though our work is different.</p>\n<p><b>What are some of the things that you&#8217;ve seen yourself and people close to you, women close to you in the industry experience over time?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Age plays a positive factor for me, because the fact that I&#8217;ve been older all along through this period. There&#8217;s a whole world [now] of women in engineering and technical jobs that&#8217;s growing and getting a lot of attention, which is great. There are other women, often in sales and marketing, other functions. And there&#8217;s a little bit looser aspirational [efforts there]. I drop in on them – they want to know how to negotiate better for a salary, or how to be the only woman in a group of men, or something like that. They want to know how to be taken seriously. And I am taken seriously. Whether or not I have a lot of clout is a whole other story, but people don&#8217;t dismiss me as an airhead or a little girl, so that&#8217;s an advantage of age [chuckles]. I can play the age card to my advantage to a certain extent. And I think [these younger women] are finding they want to make their mark, want to figure out the politics and how to self-promote because that&#8217;s not a normal thing [for women]. And I do understand all those things, though I don&#8217;t feel like they&#8217;re my fights [at this point]. And by the way, I&#8217;m single and I don&#8217;t have kids. So, I didn&#8217;t have to worry about that either, and these are very real things that people go through. Some of my women friends at work who are moms or have young kids or take maternity leave develop bonds and connections for support that are great, and I&#8217;m not really part of that. I&#8217;m glad they are doing that. Some of it like I say is age related, where I don&#8217;t have to worry about some of the same things that they&#8217;re [dealing with now].</span></p>\n<p><b>So you come from a blue-collar background. How do your friends and family feel about your life in Silicon Valley and how far you&#8217;ve come?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, my parents are gone now. My mom lived a long time, and she came to visit me at Google once. She lived to be 92, and the fact that her life spanned including going to the Google campus was kind of amazing. I don&#8217;t think she ever really understood what I did there other than work in technology, and it had to do with writing and editing and whatnot, but she knew I was successful. That was satisfying to her for sure, that I&#8217;d grown up and I bought a house. That was kind of the extent of it, honestly. I did once buy her a Mac. Interestingly, she had to learn how to use a mouse because she spent many, many, many years typing on a typewriter, so this weird extra thing that is this object, and that&#8217;s how you touch the screen. She got it, but it was a bit of a struggle. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway [to family and friends] I think I&#8217;m considered interesting. It goes with the things I was saying earlier: People with absolutely no connections to this world, know a word like “Google” or know the word “Twitter” or know Silicon Valley or San Francisco or the Bay Area. They don&#8217;t know necessarily what I do, to them all of that symbolizes success. “You&#8217;ve made something of yourself, that sounds important, we&#8217;ve heard the company names.” Right? Even my friends from college, for example, who are more sophisticated than that, but to virtually all of them, I&#8217;m the one who ended up in business. Funny, because we were all hippies. And I turned this corner, not with a plan to do so.</span></p>\n<p><b>You mentioned that a lot of people come to you for advice on how to get into tech. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wrote that post on Medium about getting into tech for a couple reasons. One is I&#8217;ve known a lot of journalists over the years; I love journalism and reporting. I&#8217;m a big newshound and I just like the field, even though I didn&#8217;t really do it myself. I&#8217;ve gotten to be friendly with a lot of reporters and editors, especially from the tech world. They knew me as someone who was not a flack working in PR, and someone who appreciated their world. As the tide started to turn for the news industry, say in the last five, six, seven years in particular. Magazines were the first to go. Newspapers are in trouble. So some would reach out to me and ask, What am I going to do? You don&#8217;t seem to have sold out to the dark side, and you have a corporate job that is successful – like how do I that? Should I do that? At Google especially I got a lot of, &#8220;Should I apply for this job at Google? What&#8217;s it like?&#8221; Because they knew I&#8217;d had some journalism in my background, I’d been a freelance writer, and I wasn’t a spin doctor type, and neither were my Google PR friends, so they’d ask, what it would be like if I were to turn the switch. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then, more recently, I would just get a lot of referrals: People would say, &#8220;Hey, my friend is moving from New York, and they had an old media job, they were an old media executive, now they&#8217;re coming to Silicon Valley, what&#8217;s that like? And here you are, you live in that world.” So it was the combination of those two that led me to feel like I could codify some of this for people. If they&#8217;ve been executives and they expected a lot of traditional executive treatment, they weren&#8217;t going to get that in these younger companies and startups. If they were reporters who prided themselves on being kind of lone wolves and getting the byline, that would be over. You have to be more collaborative. I thought I&#8217;d put it together in a post. As to why I get referred to people, I think it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m pretty approachable – people have always said, &#8220;Hey, you are a nice person can I introduce you to someone who would benefit?&#8221; I&#8217;m interested in hearing people’s stories and what they&#8217;re thinking. I really like connecting them, &#8220;You need to talk to someone over here who had a similar experience.&#8221; It&#8217;s like pay it forward a little bit and spread it on. </span></p>\n<p><b>I’d love to know your thoughts around diversity and retention in tech.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I just love—I&#8217;m a technology optimist, and I&#8217;ve just seen so much incredible change in my world anyway, and the developed world again, in the last x number of years. I wouldn&#8217;t want to not be in something that is that fast-paced, but I do hear from friends sometimes a quality of life thing, sometimes cheaper place to live than the Bay Area, which I understand. Sometimes sort of like, you know what I had breakfast today with a colleague of mine who&#8217;s maybe closer to my age than some, and he said, &#8220;I feel like I&#8217;ve put in my 20 years here working at different companies, and I think I&#8217;m interested in commercial real estate, or something completely different, as another thing to do, that I&#8217;m thinking about.&#8221; I do hear all these things&#8211; I feel like there&#8217;s waves of people continue to  technology, Silicon Valley, the Bay area, take your pick of any of these. Because of all the mystique and there&#8217;s still a huge draw for people coming in. The question is, are there enough sort of hold overs and veterans to mix with them to make it interesting and valuable, as some other people leave. And some of them don&#8217;t leave, by the way. I&#8217;ve known very successful people who really get into philanthropy and social causes and social entrepreneurship and that sort of thing as well. That may be more of a function of having been in this business and being successful enough that they&#8217;d want to do that. But, it&#8217;s not wholesale either way. It&#8217;s not like people are leaving tech in droves. It&#8217;s more, I think some of it is situational and geographical, and some of it is, yeah sure. I remember in the, what, it probably would have been the, maybe early 90s. I remember the phrase then was Microsoft Millionaires, because after they went public, whenever that was, probably in the 80s, I remember reading about people would make like, $2 million, and they&#8217;d quit their job at Microsoft and open&#8211; they create a non-profit. I think the guy behind Room to Read was somebody like this. And now, it&#8217;s interesting. It&#8217;s possible to do, probably you&#8217;d have another zero attached or you&#8217;d want more money before you did that presumably, because the cost of everything has gone up. But, I don&#8217;t know, even the TED Conference is an interesting place to look where there&#8217;s a world of people who come there and I&#8217;ve gone for so many years. I see there are true entrepreneurs, there are true start-up people and technologists who may be successful, but who believe in the power of technology. It&#8217;s interesting, by the way, to see the number of very successful—mostly guys from Google who have taken their money and put it into something like a health thing [laughter]. very cute, very nice. You know, they move from like search technology into something they didn&#8217;t know anything about that has to do with the genome or something like that. And so, I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m often [crosstalk].</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in 5 or 10 years?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I still want to be doing the kinds of thing I&#8217;m doing [now], just more for myself. I&#8217;m on a couple of non-profit boards, and there have been interesting learning situations there. I think what I continue to like is the variety, the interesting mix of people, the mix of ideas and conversation, some high culture, some low culture, some in between. I like the intellectual stimulation. I&#8217;m a humanities person at heart. I&#8217;m not going to go to a generic startup, but I don&#8217;t mind helping some [of them] with the notion of what&#8217;s their culture, how they communicate with each other, and other things that I can do for them, because there&#8217;s just a world of interesting ideas and new ways to do things. I&#8217;m still too much of a generalist, and too much of a humanities person, and [have] hippie views about not wanting to commit to one thing. Because that was always sort of a credo of being a hippie: &#8220;I have all my options open, everything is available to me.&#8221; It&#8217;s not true when you get old, it turns out, but there&#8217;s some part of that spirit that I like still.</span></p>\n<p><b>What lessons, from a high level, have been most important to you over this time, that you would share with folks hoping to either join tech or stay in tech long-term?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>It&#8217;s really great to have an appreciation of where things have been, and where they are now.</em> To have a sense of history and trajectory about things, because I think you enjoy more knowing. With my older friends, we can geek out about remembering when fax machines seemed like a good idea, when they came in, or when we used to have, I don&#8217;t know, a Syquest drive for backing up stuff. Whatever it is, something that seems so absurd now, and is only from the last 20 years. <em>It&#8217;s really fun to be able to marvel and appreciate this incredible arc that is within a lifetime. Within even a portion of a lifetime. It&#8217;s amazing, to be swept along, whatever your company, or your business, or technology reference is. That to me is worth it. </em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But you really only get that sense of appreciation over time. Another notion is that so many of these things have a big impact around the world, even if it&#8217;s something really simple. Like when Twitter started, it was designed around the small text message limitation. That was on  purpose, to be able to do it in places where you only had SMS. That sort of thing is compelling for people who are in, or  want to be in, these kinds of world-changing businesses. Like a Google search, that search quality is so good, and continues to improve, and no one&#8217;s work is done. You want to keep on and look the impact this thing has had. I think, that&#8217;s a draw for people, as well as [giving] purpose and meaning. Another draw would  be the kind of pace you get to see, and live with, in the technology world. I could not live without a draw like that. Don&#8217;t take that away from me! </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born in South Africa. I was born in Soweto, which is a township in the Johannesburg area. And I was born there in the &#8217;80s which was a very tumultuous time to be born there. The height of the armed resistance against Apartheid. My mom went to Soweto to have me from Botswana, which was where she was living with my father. My father was in exile at the time and so he couldn&#8217;t come in to South Africa. So the first couple of weeks of my life it was just me, mom and the grandparents. But then ended up going back to Botswana and was there for a little bit. But the circumstances worsened quite precipitously and it got very violent and a number of people were killed in our immediate circle, and my parents decided that we needed to leave, so we came to the United States.</span></p>\n<p><b>Wow. Where&#8217;d you land?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York City. JFK [chuckles].</span></p>\n<p><b>What was that like for you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t know.</span></p>\n<p><b>You were still tiny?</b></p>\n<p>I was tiny. But it was a rough-and-tumble couple of months there. It was a thousand bucks, and the Hebrew International Aid Society was an organization that took us. They and New York Association for New Americans had been taking refuges obviously for quite some time, and they were just great to us. They saved us. We lived in the Latham Hotel, which was a homeless shelter. We were on food stamps, and jobless and penniless, and all that. My mom ended up getting a job as an ESL teacher at Fashion Institute of Technology, and my dad got a job as a cashier and coat checker at the Museum of Natural History. That was actually 30 years ago. 30 years ago in April is when we landed. Then my dad eventually became a teacher at a public school in Queens. And my mom became a permanent substitute at an elementary school. They were both teachers, and we eventually got an apartment in south Bronx near Jerome Avenue. You could hear Yankee stadium. Dad didn&#8217;t know what a baseball was, but he loved cricket, so we ultimately ended up going to some baseball games. We even saw the Yankees coming out of the stadium once, when  after a game and my dad met Reggie Jackson was the Yankee at the time. He ended up getting the tickets, so he&#8217;s a lifelong very big Yankees fan.</p>\n<p><b>What was it like being raised in New York but in a family that&#8217;s not from New York or not from America?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s a good question, but it makes me realize I should tell more of the story. My parents were both trained as educators and they&#8217;ve been teachers in Botswana and in South Africa with my mom. They ultimately had heard from a fellow teacher at Maru-A-Pula in Botswana about a school called Milton Academy in Boston. My dad was doing some research and he ended up applying for a job at a school called Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. We drove up together, the whole family. They offered him the job, and we made the move. So I grow up in Andover, on an idyllic tree lined, prep-school campus as the son of a chemistry teacher.</span></p>\n<p><b>Wow. That&#8217;s a change.</b></p>\n<p>So maybe the question that you haven&#8217;t asked that is the interesting one to answer is, What&#8217;s it like going to and growing up on a fancy prep school campus while being eminently unfancy?</p>\n<p><b>Yes.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t know what it would be like not doing that. So I can&#8217;t really answer the counterfactual to it. But it was really wonderful. I learned English in preschool and I had learned Spanish in New York. Spanish was actually my first language. And then Xhosa, which is my sort of family language, was my second language. So I was speaking this very odd mix of the three when I got to preschool. The teachers were like, &#8220;Wow, it sounds like Spanish but he&#8217;s clicking.&#8221; It was funny. It was wonderful. I was the only black person in my class often. Sometimes there were two. So I learned to translate. I got really used to people wanting to play with my hair. Wanting me to, &#8220;Say your last name. Say it again. Say it again. Say it again.&#8221; And and I became fluent in the language of suburban affluent white America, but fluent in it knowing that I was never part of it. So I remember there was a moment when I was probably six or seven, where I was thinking about Ronald Reagan, because he had just been President. I had a panic moment because I was like, &#8220;Ronald Reagan was President and I don&#8217;t think I can be President because I&#8217;m black and because I wasn&#8217;t born here and because I have a funny name [chuckles].&#8221;Two out of those three are no longer thoughts that a six-year-old would have in those circumstances, which is pretty great. I had numbers of moments like that where I was just like, &#8220;Wow, I&#8217;m really not one of them.&#8221; And so it was always a little bit disorientated, especially because my parents being activists and civil rights activists particularly, always instilled in us a very, very strong sense of self and a very acute and intimate sensitivity to racism. So it was something I was always thinking about, and it was ever present. When I got to college and people like, &#8220;Oh. You went to Andover?&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, I&#8217;m a lot preppier than you think because I actually grew up on the campus but I&#8217;m a lot less preppy than you could ever understand, because of all the other stuff. And so, it&#8217;s just weird to be a third rail kid. To have a foot on both sides of the ocean.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. That&#8217;s interesting. What did you think you were going to be when you grew up? And did you have family pointing you in any particular direction?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I thought I was going to be the president until I was six. And then I thought, &#8220;You know what? I might still be able to.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>And then, later, I wanted to be a lawyer. And then I wanted to be a diplomat because my—I have diplomats in my family. So, I knew about it—I learned about it early. And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Speaking multiple languages helps.&#8221; And I went, &#8220;Okay. Great.&#8221;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I got to college, however, I wanted to be a chemical engineer. My dad was a chemistry teacher. I was his student in chemistry. I was a very disciplined and conscientious chemistry student. And so, when I—and I even weighed the quality of the chemical engineering as part of the decision matrix for choosing my college. So, I really wanted to be a chemical engineer, or so I thought.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. When did that turn?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I hated college passionately.</span></p>\n<p><b>Me too.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Really? Hooray! I hated college so much. There were a couple of reasons. One thing I always say somewhat jokingly is if you are a drop out of Harvard or Stanford you must be a genius, but if you&#8217;re a drop out of a community college you must be emotionally compromised somehow. I was actually just emotionally compromised, not a genius. I hated college because it was very lonely. I was black but not black American in the sense that I didn&#8217;t have the shared history and I didn&#8217;t grow up in a black American home. I grew up in a black home in a America. So that was a very strange thing that I couldn&#8217;t navigate and so finding my people was a little disorienting on that basis. I was preppy but not wealthy. I was African but not Nigerian. That was just from the social side I was very isolated. Academically, I hated engineering and I had gotten about half way through it and then I just stopped. I switched to philosophy, and thought that philosophy would be a very purely intellectually stimulating pursuit, and I was sorely disappointed by that too. I ended up dropping out and it was a pretty shameful dropout, but I remember that—I realized that most of the people who were at school were highly intrinsically motivated self-starters with working parents with graduate degrees and per capita incomes of $250K and greater, and so they needed Stanford degrees. The notion of it being the best school was really that they selected people who were already going to be okay, and I found that also to be really distasteful &#8211; like it was such a—it felt like it was finishing school for the already successful, which  got me really depressed.</span></p>\n<p>So, I dropped out.</p>\n<p><b>What happened after that?</b></p>\n<p>We did a startup, naturally. That&#8217;s the thing about Stanford. I will say, 2003, four, five, startups were, compared to now, they weren&#8217;t on anybody&#8217;s radar. But a guy at the business school was working on a project out of this class, Formation of New Ventures, which was taught by a VC and, you know? And he and I crossed paths and he was like, &#8220;You should come work for me on this.&#8221; And he asked me to do it because I had a lot of Facebook friends and, at that time, that actually meant something [laughter].</p>\n<p>And so, and he was working on a product that was oriented towards the demographic that I had the connection to which is the young professional types. And so, I agreed to work for him. And so, I came on as a very early employee and in very short order we raised some capital and I was launched into the tech world.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m curious what your impressions were, or maybe even preconceptions of Silicon Valley, and whether or not they lived up to your expectations.</strong></p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t have a ton because I was interested in science and engineering, so not really in technology per say. Certainly not in business innovation, and so I didn&#8217;t come in with any sort of presumptions particularly. What I will say I was surprised by, and only recently I was stopped being surprised by the fact that it&#8217;s a human capital business. It&#8217;s a people business and people tend to have insular networks. It&#8217;s very much a people business with a lot of instinct and gut and those types of things tied to people. It&#8217;s not that accessible surprisingly. I would have thought, and there was a brief period where I did think it was ridiculously accessible. It&#8217;s funny because it should be the most accessible place in the world. That is, I think, a preconception that I was disabused of. The other piece is venture is even more intensely that way&#8230; Times a thousand</p>\n<p><strong>Walk me through the startup chapter of your life when you were in it as an employee.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, boy. I think we accidentally picked up the anti-startup handbook [chuckles]. We were building in PHP. I think we were building in PHP because Facebook was but no other real reason. All of the engineers we knew wanted to build on the Ruby framework or rails framework and we hired a series of executives and we outsourced to Russia non-thoughtfully. We had a hierarchical culture that emerged relatively quickly. We&#8217;re dealing with some intense cultural stuff. It was chaotic. It was intensely chaotic. In retrospect we were on the verge of going out of business for six months and I was naive and didn&#8217;t quite realize it at the time because it is a momentum thing. When the momentum was good you feel awesome even though you&#8217;re spending other people&#8217;s money and you&#8217;re lighting it on fire, basically. That was intense. The high highs and frequent lows were also a feature in that chapter of startup life. In part because I was also just not in a very good state. It felt like I had failed, in fact. I think it&#8217;s safe to say I had failed, in the sense that my parents were deeply disappointed and concerned about my state of being, and my peer group didn&#8217;t really understand me, and they thought I was sort of flailing in the wind, and I felt a little bit like I was. And this cult of failure that people celebrate here is  because failure just sucks a lot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s plenty of failure out there. It&#8217;s not hard to find. And when people here talk about failure, they&#8217;re actually talking about success, and they&#8217;re talking about overcoming failure, which is all well and good but celebrating failure is something that is a pet peeve of mine because of having felt like I was fully failed. And we were able to sort of land the plane on the startup and get an outcome for it, and exit the business in a way that we were licking our wounds a bit, but it&#8217;s still alive. But it felt like a failure, and these outcomes feel so binary here, where if you&#8217;re not on the, &#8220;Oh, my god, this is it crushing it&#8221; track, you have failed. And that just really hurts. It’s so defeating. It&#8217;s so de-motivating. And the piece that I find motivating is not when I&#8217;ve failed, but it&#8217;s believing that there&#8217;s a chance that I can eventually succeed [chuckles]. A promise of success is what&#8217;s motivating me. So that period I try not to think about that much, and I&#8217;ve managed just like we all have to retroactively tell the story very neatly. Like, &#8220;Oh, like 300,000 users and a Series A!&#8221; But the truth is the matter is I was just sort of lost and confused, and we were making not excellent decisions with this startup, and I didn&#8217;t know my ass from my elbow, and so it&#8217;s been clear to me, if I even was value add, even though the founder kept me on—so it was not recommended. People have asked me. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, should I drop out of school, because you did?&#8221; &#8220;Don&#8217;t. Please don&#8217;t.&#8221; It sucks. It&#8217;s so lonely, and it&#8217;s discouraging and it&#8217;s so embarrassing and shameful. Don&#8217;t do it, you know? And not enough people, I think, are talking about that, so.</span></p>\n<p><strong>You touched on otherness growing up. Not feeling like you fit in with white kids. Not feeling like you fit in with American black kids. Did you feel that otherness when you worked in startup land?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, yeah. The otherness&#8211;if I had to characterize the feeling in one word, it would be poor [laughter]. And I hear people say, &#8220;Just boot strap it.&#8221; It&#8217;s like what does that mean, you know? My credit score got crushed because I wasn&#8217;t sophisticated about that and my parents, they didn&#8217;t know a ton about that stuff. And so, they hadn&#8217;t really given me all the lessons. I didn&#8217;t have a nest egg. I didn&#8217;t have savings to speak of. I didn&#8217;t have aunts and uncles who could float me five, ten K to say nothing of the 50, hundred K&#8217;s that people get. And yes, of course, there&#8217;s cultural stuff. And there is gas lighting and feelings of invisible racism and other isms that are manifesting in conversations and manifesting in the challenges I encounter when I access certain networks but when the truth—when push comes to shove, not having as much money as everybody else around me was by far the biggest feeling of othering or otherness.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Me too. Yeah. I remember going—and no one knew this but going to all of my friends’ millionaire houses and partying with them and then going home and eating my pocket ramen like every night and being like, “Fuck. Am I the only one in tech living like this?” </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And poverty&#8217;s expensive, you know? It kicks you—it has a cognitive toll and a physical toll and it&#8217;s really hard to keep pace in a fast-moving environment when you&#8217;re also trying to navigate your personal finances. And it&#8217;s hard to do that I remember, I said to somebody that I&#8217;ve never been to SXSW, because when I was a broke, startup person, whether I was an early employee, or later a founder, I just didn&#8217;t have the money to fly there. That&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t go. Now it&#8217;s like, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t go, because I&#8217;m way too cool for it.&#8221; No, I just was poor, and you were not, because your aunt gave you money. People might be surprised by how often people outside of the dominant demographic just don&#8217;t have financial access. Just disproportionately, don&#8217;t have financial access, and therefore, our risk calculus and the way we navigate this world, and how we spend our time, has to be different, because there&#8217;s some stuff we can&#8217;t afford to do. Ski week? Fuck off.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Yeah. That tweet storm that went around yesterday, the YC guy, I was looking at the replies, and I saw one guy’s reply just be like, “Did you ever consider not taking funding?” I’m like, what a silly assumption. To assume that it’s possible for him to just bootstrap it. With what money?</strong></p>\n<p>Now that I&#8217;m on this side of the table, I&#8217;m guilty of this too. Come back to us when you have some traction. Why don&#8217;t you raise a friends or family or an angel round. a.k.a I assume that you are in your first degree connections, in a world of millionaires. Which is a horrible and stupid assumption, and is incorrect and is wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>I make the same assumptions, even as someone who wasn’t a rich person here. I still assume that everybody else is.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s also this weird duck syndrome thing too, where we&#8217;re part of your credibility and your ability to make moves in this network is fundamentally tied to a money thing. You have to hang and so you have to fake it. There are plenty of people I know, and I was one of these who were furiously paddling under the surface just to cruise. Just to have the right clothes, just to have the right gadgets. I was on a dumb phone for too long because I couldn&#8217;t afford a smartphone because my parents weren&#8217;t rich. We came here with nothing. In America, where people of color are disproportionately in less wealthy networks, that just means that money is a barrier. Period.</span></p>\n<p><strong>If you want to touch on being a founder, we can do that, but walk me through, from that first experience, to getting into VC. Did you have any idea that that would be the path?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, I&#8217;m on record all over the place, saying I&#8217;d never be in a VC. I had a view of VC, that they were just &#8230; Also deep down, I felt too poor to ever become a VC, so that was also driving it. I also just had a view of VC as Menlo Park, khakis, Princeton, MBA. I didn&#8217;t feel like that was the person I was growing into. Turns out, that&#8217;s what VC&#8217;s are, which is fine. At some point, I worked for Obama&#8217;s campaign. He was my people obviously and I was so drawn to him spiritually and then politically and culturally. That was a defining experience for me, maybe the defining professional experience for me because I remembered that I came from a line of people who were very politically motivated, not in the sense of ambitious in elected office, but who were civil rights activists and from my father to my mom’s father and my father&#8217;s grandfather and it&#8217;s all an investment in the future &#8212; in mine and my generation’s lives. I felt like that was something that was important to me that I had forgotten in the rat race of Churn and MRR and valuations and tech conferences and shit and so it reminded me that the only work that I really felt was worth doing over the very long term had to have some political point of view and had to be positive social results and that stuck with me since and has changed the way I felt about business. And that deepens the more I learn about our economy and my view of capitalism. So that was awesome, like, introducing Michelle Obama on election eve, which was just wild. Then, after working on some startups, I realized that I wanted to repair the relationship with my parents and then went back to school.</span></p>\n<p><b>At this point, were they super stressed about you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, they were used to it, but there was a constant hum of stress that had been following them for years. I knew it, and I could hear it, too, so I had it, too.</span></p>\n<p><b>What was it like, going back to school?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best decision of my life. I met my wife. I met my wife, and I also got involved with the d. school, and started really enjoying some of the philosophy work I was doing —actually continued into graduate classes and began a thesis on the theory of intention, which I still find fascinating.  But instead of finishing a Master&#8217;s, I ended up dropping out again to join Collaborative Fund. But it was great to be, you know, learning environment, having lived, having done a couple startups, and been in different parts of the world, and been around poverty, and been around extreme wealth, and just seeing stuff, you know? </span></p>\n<p><strong>What have been some of the toughest parts of your work?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toughest parts of the work. Well, VC is not&#8211;being a VC is one of the best jobs in the world so it&#8217;s hard to complain about it. I truly love it. And, on some level, it doesn&#8217;t feel right to complain about it but if I see fifteen hundred companies in a year I usually make six investments. And so, I&#8217;m in the business of saying no. And I&#8217;m a dream crusher. That&#8217;s my job. And &#8220;you are what you repeatedly do&#8221;, it&#8217;s been said, right? And so I crush dreams. And that is trying. It never gets easier. And because somebody will have such an amazing story. You can just see blood, sweat, and tears all over their product and you can see that they&#8217;re just hungry &#8211; physically and spiritually &#8211; and you have to say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like your brand. it&#8217;s just so crappy. The hardest part about that, too, at the earliest stage, because there&#8217;s no data, is, I can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s not personal. It&#8217;s personal. That&#8217;s all it is. It&#8217;s not just, really hurt the people. I totally understand it, and some people get really offended, and take it personally, as they rightfully should. Doing that every day, just doesn&#8217;t feel good. Having to find a way to do that while also maintaining one&#8217;s reputation, because as a VC, your personal belief in your firm&#8217;s brand is all you have. If we have to disappoint people all day every day, and still maintain a good reputation, that&#8217;s a tough nut to crack. Finding ways to say no to people, such that they&#8217;ll say nice things, is a weird thing to have to do every day.</span></p>\n<p><strong>In this project the idea has come up that VCs are interested in investing only in problems that they can relate to. What are your thoughts?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, well, one of the things that I&#8217;ve caught myself doing, and I&#8217;m ashamed of, and I don&#8217;t do it anymore, or at least I try not to do it anymore is I&#8217;ll see a feminine hygeine product, and I&#8217;ll think, oh I don&#8217;t know anything about that market. But then I&#8217;ll see a construction management software, and I&#8217;ll think oh, that&#8217;s interesting. Which is crazy behavior and is deeply sexist behavior. And probably misogynistic behavior because tied to that is: I don&#8217;t want to know anything about X, Y, or Z. And that is dark. And I&#8217;ve caught myself doing that. And I&#8217;ve caught myself, also, meeting with an entrepreneur from Paducah, Kentucky and, on the basis of that person&#8217;s accent, making judgments about their likelihood of being an effective engineer. I&#8217;ve caught myself evaluating somebody&#8217;s watch or effective—maybe Spanish was their first language and they have slightly darker skin and then discounting the quality of the design of their product. Just stuff like that. And&#8211;</span></p>\n<p><b>Interesting considering Spanish was your first language.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know, right? Yeah [laughter]. And I am somebody who&#8217;s trying my hardest to actively avoid these unconscious biases. And so, Lord help the rest of the industry. And yeah. Lord help the rest of the industry. It&#8217;s so tough. And there&#8217;s so many companies that, if you are a 26-year-old heterosexual white male living in a city, you are their target customer. And one thing that&#8217;s funny about VC is most VCs are old, too, and don&#8217;t live in cities. And so, that&#8217;s not even their experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And I think it&#8217;s we invest in people who we recognize. And because ultimately this is a human capital business and the signals are instinct and gut driven and your networks are insular and stuff. So, if somebody uses the right language or communication—body language, physical language, et cetera, and makes you feel like you&#8217;re in home space, then, I think, that is a criteria that loosens the strings. And so, I think that means that I, conceivably, have an advantage investing in people of color, and that a woman should have an advantage investing in products that serve half of the population that has been underserved &#8211; in theory. In practice it&#8217;s hard because—this author Richard Wright talks about this phenomenon called the beast in the skull, where he says that the effect of racism—racism twists the psychology and the consciousness of the racist, and of the receiver of said racism. So I&#8217;m as awful as a so-called racist is,and so I don&#8217;t trust my instincts sometimes because I&#8217;m wracked with my own level of guilt about my own biases, and about stuff that I&#8217;ve internalized that I know has been fed to me and I really don&#8217;t want, but that I have. I get all twisted up about it myself, and that is tragic. I don&#8217;t really know what to do about that. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Let’s come back here for a second. How do you—we touched on this quite a bit, but how do you feel about the state of Tech in 2016? Like what is really exciting to you? What frustrates you?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What&#8217;s really exciting to me is the unrelenting optimism. I really do feel like Tech as an industry is a very supportive culture once you&#8217;re on the inside of it. And it&#8217;s a very collaborative culture and some people are always co-conspirators and stuff. And even though there are—yeah, so there&#8217;s that. And then the piece that troubles me a little bit is this thread, or this belief in the hero culture and the cult of the founder and these sycophants, you know? You know, Jobs didn&#8217;t change the world alone, obviously. And so it&#8217;s scary to think about that because I think of that makes it harder to build, really inclusive and ultimately resilient culture &#8211; that hero culture thing. And it&#8217;s also not true of the best of tech. The best of tech is very collaborative, and it&#8217;s very open to criticism and is constantly adjusting and is swim or die, and so it&#8217;s always moving, and the best of tech feels like a hip hop world &#8211; you&#8217;re only as good as your last hit, and you&#8217;re always trying to get on somebody else&#8217;s single, and there&#8217;s beefs, but you&#8217;re all in this together and ultimately you&#8217;re trying to lift—you&#8217;re trying to push the whole culture forward, and you&#8217;re remixing the past and you&#8217;re constantly sampling and you know your history and you&#8217;re tied to this optimism through generations. And I think these are really wonderful features of this industry and they&#8217;re poorly understood by people outside of it, and then a lot of newcomers, which scares me a little bit. I&#8217;m cautiously optimistic now.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in five or ten years? Think you&#8217;ll still be in tech land?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. A VC said something beautiful the day before yesterday. She was talking about feedback cycles and how some are longer and some are shorter. And in VC, the feedback cycle is so long that it looks like a straight line because it just takes forever to—it takes six, seven years to learn because that&#8217;s when whatever comes to fruition when you seeded the company. When it&#8217;s outcome has started to play out. And so, I don&#8217;t even know if I&#8217;m good at this yet. I know, now, that I can have a career in it but I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m going to get in it yet. And so, I think I need another three to five years to just know that. So, maybe ask me in three to five years but I suspect I&#8217;ll be doing this for 20 years.</span></p>\n<p><strong>My last question for you would be: what advice would you have for people from similar backgrounds who are hoping to get into tech or VC?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Number one would be to save money. Because if you have personal runway then you are structurally more like most of the people who have succeeded. That&#8217;s one and that&#8217;s not an easy thing to do, but save money. The second would be to try and divide the world of startups, especially in early stage setups, into two functions that constitute a startup. One is building the product. The other one is selling the product. And so figure out if you&#8217;re a builder or a seller and don&#8217;t be afraid of sales if you are a seller. Choose the one that you have the best chance at. By keeping it simple that way you can maybe orient and organize your activities around one of those two frameworks. Then, the third would be that who you know can be the difference maker, who you know is not whose cellphone and email address you have. It&#8217;s who is going to go into bat for you. A lot of people wrongly think that collecting a Rolodex is productive networking, and I think but that&#8217;s only 1% of it and I think that probably 60% of it is effective follow-up so I can&#8217;t tell you the number of times I&#8217;ve said, reach out to me and somebody reaches out. We have a nice first conversation. I don&#8217;t hear from them for a while and they reach out asking for something. At that point you&#8217;re like asking a stranger for something. What&#8217;s that going to do for you? Add value before you extract it. Be thoughtful and followup. Treat people well, meet them where they&#8217;re at. Be curious about other&#8217;s lives and learn about them. Listen to others and then use that to build your network.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Tell me where you&#8217;re from?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m from Dayton, Texas.</span></p>\n<p><b>What were your early years like?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My early years were awesome and full of fun stories. I was adopted by my Aunt and Uncle. They separated when I was 12, so through that unique family setup I have 6 sisters and 2 brothers, either half-, step-, or through adoption. My parents were Pentecostal Evangelical Preachers, so I grew up really super religious, sheltered, not that many friends. I came out when I was 13 which was pretty crazy, going through all the stuff that was related to that at a young age in the middle of nowhere in Texas.</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m curious what it was like in your experience being a gay guy growing up in Texas.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Small town, hyper-religious Texas! I don&#8217;t know how I managed to get out unscathed. I came out in school when I was 13, and I think back to what we were talking about at the beginning: having dangerous overconfidence and doing things without thinking was just what I always did. I remember watching <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer_as_Folk_(2000_TV_series)\" target=\"_blank\">Queer as Folk</a> and thinking &#8220;Oh, I like guys, they like guys… Oh, I&#8217;m gay. I get it.&#8221; And I didn&#8217;t really think about the consequences but I came out to my friends. Since I lived in backwoods Texas, I was made fun of daily by students and teachers at school, and I was really, really depressed and suicidal at times. My Mom didn’t really know what to do with me during that period but she did tell me that things will get better which was definitely true. It just required moving out of Texas as soon as I could. Some of the people that bullied me have reached out on Facebook to apologize and I always tear up when I get these types of messages and struggle with what to say back, but I always respond and thank them for reaching out. </span></p>\n<p><b>How did you first get interested in tech? I didn&#8217;t know about tech growing up in tiny little south. How did that get on your radar?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. That&#8217;s a really good question. It involves Björk, Spice Girls, and my mom ordering a computer from one of those mail-order catalogs and AOL [laughter]. Oh and it also involves Buffy the Vampire Slayer; Spice Girls, Björk, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mom got a computer and then we also got dial-up AOL and at the time there were a lot of services like Angelfire and Geocities. My first fansite was for the Spice Girls, and that was the first year. I made an Angelfire website about how much I loved the Spice Girls. I was just like, &#8220;I&#8217;m making a Spice Girl fansite.&#8221; I was obsessed with Ginger Spice, and there were a bunch of other fan websites, too. I was just like, &#8220;How did they make these? These are so cool. I have to learn this.&#8221; I would collect all my favorite images and upload them to my fansite, and then the next year I had a total shift from pop stuff to Björk and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Then I made a Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan site and then I got a personal website where I put up poetry that was based off Björk’s music and photographs I had taken. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s how I got my initial taste of digital design, and then I just always did it. In high school, I had moved to Salt Lake City my senior year and they had a lot more classes to offer, like a web design class that I took. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT\" target=\"_blank\">LGBT</a> Center put out a note to any teens that wanted to do web design that there was a multi-media company looking for help with a website for an anti-smoking campaign targeting teens. I volunteered and ended up getting a half year long web apprenticeship from it.</span></p>\n<p><b>Cool.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So during that, I did my first professional website where I designed and coded it for that project for the Health Department, and it won an award that year at the Utah Multimedia Arts Festival. And then after that I did some freelance design work, maybe for a Summer or two, then I collected all the stuff that I had done and printed it out and made a portfolio. A friend referred me for a position at a web development company looking for a junior designer so I applied, interviewed and got the job. I was so nervous; it paid 11 dollars an hour and to me that was so much money at the time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, it wasn&#8217;t anything I really thought about. I started doing it at a young age and it&#8217;s just kind of gone up from there. Now I&#8217;m at a large tech company, which is kind of crazy. And the caliber that they hire for there, I&#8217;m constantly reminded of every day, which leads to imposter syndrome, but that&#8217;s a separate topic.</span></p>\n<p><b>Tell me more about what your experience is like being surrounded by Ivy leaguers, having never been to college?</b></p>\n<p>I’ve definitely experienced <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Imposter syndrome</a> and my manager has been amazing in helping me unpack that and work through it. I definitely go home and overthink everything I said or did at work. I constantly tell myself that I went through the same interview process as all the other designers at the company, and that a lot of people were involved in that process. I tell myself that I’m supposed to be here and that this wasn’t by accident. I told a co-worker who went to Princeton recently that I didn’t go to college, and he said, &#8220;I would have not known that.&#8221; That was awesome to hear. I’m starting to feel better about letting people know I didn’t go to college if it ever comes up. So with imposter syndrome I’ve come to refer to it as reverse ego and to tell myself that I’m thinking about myself way too much in a negative way right now. That’s really helped me snap out of whatever mind spiral I’m in, thinking about myself so much and thinking I’m not qualified to do this job. Framing it differently has really helped me recognize when my mind goes there, and to think the opposite.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s a testament too, good for you, if you were able to have that life, where you went to the Ivy Leagues. That&#8217;s awesome, but that&#8217;s not it. That&#8217;s not all it takes.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where did you find your early support networks, when you came here?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In San Francisco? Oh, that&#8217;s a really good question. I had a childhood friend from Texas living in the Tenderloin and she was kind of like my San Francisco Sherpa. She took me to Dolores Park for the first time and she connected me to a lot of people for freelance work. And the gay community was definitely a good support network. That&#8217;s how I got all my freelance work. And that&#8217;s who connected me to a lot of jobs. I would post on Facebook that I was looking for freelance work and I would get a bunch of referrals. Actually an acquaintance in the gay community referred me to Facebook and that’s how I got my current job. </span></p>\n<p><b>What are your biggest motivators?</b></p>\n<p>This is a good question. I’ve never thought I was a good designer. I have this idea in my head of what a really good designer is and I guess my biggest motivator is trying to aspire to that. I have so much more to learn and so much room to grow. Another motivator that’s spanned over the past 10 years are the people that told me I wasn’t going to make it as a designer and also being told I wasn’t going to make it in San Francisco. I’ve learned that I love being told that I can’t do something, so that makes me try even harder and makes me even more motivated.</p>\n<p><b>So what are you working on right now, either for work or for yourself? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working on traveling more! Right now I’m trying to learn French and reading some books about France and Paris, planning a trip there this summer. I have never left continental North America before so this is my first international trip. Being a contractor for a long time, you never get paid vacation, it’s always about finding the next gig or have a backup gig in case the current job ends early, there’s a lot of hustle involved. So trying to work on traveling more and taking time off work. I can easily fall into the rut of over working and never taking any vacation. </span></p>\n<p><b>What advice would you give to folks from similar backgrounds who are in tech or hoping to get into it?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the people hoping to get into tech, simply learn to learn and get into a habit of always learning something new and find opportunities to use your newly found knowledge. That opened a lot of doors for me early on. When I was 19, I taught myself CSS over the span of a weekend and then used what I learned the very next week by taking on freelance development gigs that required it. So you need to have hustle too. And also, if people tell you that you can’t do something, don’t let that defeat you; use that as your motivation. For the people in tech with similar backgrounds, hit me up, lets support each other! </span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in 5 or 10 years? And Is there anything you’re focusing on doing differently in the future?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is a really good question. In 5 years, I hope I’m still at my current job. I’ve spent that last 8 years contracting, working at various places, which lead to learning a lot really really, quickly and I’m definitely grateful for those experiences. When reflecting on why I changed jobs so much in my 20s it was because there were always new opportunities,the grass always seemed greener on the other side. On a deeper level, it was mainly centered around being afraid of people getting to know the real me so I switched jobs/places a lot. I was kind of burned at my first job in the Bay Area; my manager would make fun of me to our coworkers. I would wear bowties to work, was younger and little more flamboyant. He would say things like, “did you see what the faggot was wearing today?” As someone who over thinks everything and is highly sensitive, when I learned about this, it was lighter fluid to the fire that is my anxiety. After contracting there, I was very closed off with the people I worked with from then on. When I was asked if I wanted to go with the team for dinner or drinks, I would immediately say no. I didn’t actually talk about being gay at a few of the places for fear of what happened at my first Bay Area job. I really cheated myself on becoming friends with some really cool, talented people because of this defense mechanism. When people would ask me if I had a girlfriend, I would just say I’m single. Now I’m focusing on allowing people to get to know the authentic, real me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of never talking about anything related to my personal/dating life at work, now when I go to lunch with my team I share about my awkward OkCupid dates and the crazy guys I meet, which is almost every OkCupid date. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I’ve learned that you can’t make 10 out of 10 people like you no matter what you do, so you should just be yourself no matter what. So my plan is to stay at my current company for as long as possible, learn as much as I can and let the people I work with get to know the real me. I’m grateful to work for a company that encourages people to be their authentic selves at work. Also, learning how to stay put in an industry that has a lot of open roles and when you’re being contacted by recruiters everyday is really hard; it has become the norm to only be with a company for 10 months. What I’ve learned though is that the grass is NEVER greener on the other side and most the time when I switched jobs, I regretted it for the first couple of months. Focusing on working through whatever issues you’re having that’s making you consider changing jobs will make you grow and become a better person, versus not addressing issues and just finding a new opportunity. I’ve tested the old adage many times: “Wherever you go… there you are” and it’s totally true. As for 10 years, I’m not sure where I’ll be. A lot of my favorite mentors in my career completely switched industries halfway through their careers which I think lead to them being even more badass and creative. I’m not sure what my second career will be yet. One of my new goals is doing a project for Beyoncé at some point in the next 10 years though 🙂 </span></p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Let&#8217;s start from the beginning. Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born and raised in Atlanta. Growing up I was very into a lot of different things. Things that moved, provided utility, and looked beautiful. I didn&#8217;t really know what I wanted to do; I just knew that things I could kind of put together were really exciting to me. When I was little I was actually very obsessed with Bentley &amp; Mercedes-Benz and the cars they designed. I would print out pictures of the cars and look at them. My dad would always ask me, &#8220;what are you doing?&#8221; and I was like, &#8220;I really don&#8217;t know. I just think they look very nice and someone created this.” Just like really early on I always was trying to figure out what was it about things that people could put together and what made them special and what could I produce one day for the world.</span></p>\n<p><b>What did you think you were going to be when you grew up? What direction did your parents see you going into?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was growing up I was pretty much like a normal kid growing up in Atlanta, especially in the southern part of Atlanta. Just being in the south in general—most kids were like just into sports, like school activities, things like that, clothes and stuff, Air Force 1, Nikes and Jordans. Although, I always believed in things that made someone feel a way. Whether it was an S class Mercedes for the successful CEO or a new pair of Nikes for my childhood friend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I played sports. I played baseball for ten years. I also played basketball when I was in junior high. And so, for a while, I thought I’d want to play professional sports. And then after I didn&#8217;t do that, I wanted to make a lot of money doing something. I didn&#8217;t know how I was going to do that. Up until that point I viewed money as a feeling that anyone could obtain. I still do in some cases. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My family was always super supportive of me building a life I was proud of. They just knew that whatever I was going to do, I was going to be very passionate about it. It was very different from anything they all pursued themselves professionally. My mother was a teacher for 30 years. She taught language arts. My brother is actually in law enforcement. My dad was a PM for the City of Atlanta. He actually helped lead electronic payroll for the city and other projects. So, they were all very different and passionate about what they did as well. </span></p>\n<p><b>What was the moment when you discovered design/tech and was like, &#8220;Oh man, this is it!&#8221;</b></p>\n<p><em>By the time I had joined Myspace, and I was introduced to HTML, it was life changing. I think myspace is one of the greatest things ever because it made kids learn how to do things and build their own things without them really even noticing what they were doing. That was so powerful.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  I thought that was just so important, and that happened for me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I discovered a website where you could go and get a layout of custom backgrounds and stuff, and it was called freeweblayouts.net. And the two individuals who owned it were actually two African American guys. They were like 22 years old and had built the biggest resource site for myspace. And I just thought it was so fascinating and inspiring. When I went to the site and processed the idea that people made graphics that had code in them and were a resource and a utility, to an extent, it threw off a light bulb. The first day I saw the site, I was like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m going to do this one day. I don&#8217;t know how, but I want to make this stuff.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A year later—maybe a year, it may not have even been a full year—I had found the owners on Myspace, and I kept sending them messages. I spent many nights and weekends just learning photoshop and making my own layouts. I made some dumb stuff. I made a layout with my face. It was really weird, but I got better.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I learned to just find people that worked on the site. They had designers all over myspace. I would study their layouts, and I would go to the site everyday to see what they were building, what they were making.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then one day I reached out to them. I was like, &#8220;Hey, please check out my work.&#8221; And the one of the owners actually read my message. When I just saw he read it, I was freaking out. And he replied, and he was like, &#8220;Hey Bro. Nice work. Let&#8217;s chat on AIM.&#8221; I was so happy. From there we talked for a while and I want to say two or three weeks later, I had my first layout on the site. It was like an Alicia Keys layout or something because she had an album that just came out. </span><em>Looking back I guess an Alicia Keys myspace layout was the first thing I shipped. [laughing] I want to say like 20,000 people were using it within a week. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was pretty surreal. It was a serious moment for myself. When I got my first paycheck, I was like, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m making money, so yea, let’s do this.&#8221; And that&#8217;s really when it started.</span></p>\n<p><b>That is amazing.</b></p>\n<p><em>Yeah, and actually they did not even want to hire me in the beginning. because at the time I was 14 so like legally, I couldn&#8217;t work anywhere. My dad was receiving my paychecks and they just really took a chance on me. I was really excited because at 14 what else could I do? Work at a golf course or something? It really kind of changed my life.</em></p>\n<p><b>I love that. So, walk me through what happened from there.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fast forward to college. I met Nathan Fwamba via Twitter, who is now a really good friend of mine. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we were like 18 he moved to SF. He was telling me he was building products. It took me a while to truly understand what he meant by that. At the time, I knew a little bit about apps. I started dabbling into xcode a bit but wasn’t a pro at it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sidenote: I built this really weird Twitter client. It was called Just Tweet, and it was literally like me designing graphics that I would make for t-shirts and putting it into an iPhone. So it&#8217;s like gradients, bevels everywhere, one little input field where you just type a tweet and it would automatically send it to your timeline. It was really cool. It would probably be really nice now if I redid it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I kind of got to talk to him and learn about things about what he was working on. He was also making a lot of money. But more so, I just wanted to see if I could actually take the things I was doing in Photoshop—like make them move—and see if they can work them in a different space for a different purpose. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I really got into UI then. I was like on dribbble everyday. I had just found dribbble. I was stealing shots on Dribbble, recreating them at home and then trying to make sure they were identical to the original. It was literally like my Kanye West “5 beats a day for 3 summers” moment. Soon after Chris Tauziet had sent me an invite to officially join Dribbble. He was working at Apple in Paris at the time or had either already joined Parse. Shortly after I got some shots up a startup in Atlanta reached out to me on Dribbble. They wanted a designer to come in and help during the summer, and I was like, &#8220;Okay. I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, I joined for the summer and I had no idea how a business was run. I finally discovered how we were in a time where apps were becoming businesses and businesses were becoming apps. I learned a lot about releases and working with engineers. I never really knew what it was like to work with an engineer. I was excited. I got to build an app. I got to sort of leave my mark while I was there, and it was cool. I had a brief reality of what it meant to be the only black employee just shortly after I joined. There was a guy on the leadership team that was also a board member at Cox Enterprises here in Atlanta. At my first company meeting he joined (with his family idk why) to visit the team and hear updates. Since his last visit myself and another person had joined. When it came time to learning who was new he asked. “ Who’s new here?” Shortly before I raised my hand he stopped and said, “ Wait! raise your hand if I sign your check!” The rest of the company chuckled as if it was funny. His wife and kids also had a laugh. (I still have no idea why they were even there). It was when I began to realized this space was missing people like me and It wasn’t settling with me too well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was not offered a chance to continue working at this particular company after the summer while the other summer intern who was caucasian did receive an offer. I’m not saying it had anything to with race but yea I don’t have much else to go off of. I had more of an impact at the company at the time. I was the only designer. The other intern was like the 5th engineer doing bug fixes. Yea. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After that, through college, I was continued my passion for products and apps. I was making concept projects working on stuff with friends, but I really built my own confidence. I hadn&#8217;t done anything revolutionary. I was just making stuff just to be making it. Junior year of college, Razorfish reached out to me. They were like, &#8220;Hey, we want you to come work in our Atlanta office.&#8221; So I spent the summer at Razorfish. That was pretty cool at 20.</span></p>\n<p><em>From working at a startup and then going to Razorfish, by the time I got there I started to notice a trend that I was the only black person in the room.</em> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But at all these places I was noticed for my worth. I was touching the product everyday. I started to think why nobody else like me was doing that, especially in Atlanta. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I brushed it off and I did the thing at Razorfish, I traveled a few times. I did a concept project for Netflix, which was really exciting. I just kind of left and was like, whatever, it probably just happens in agencies. </span></p>\n<p><em>I met Jared Erondu sometime after. I was like, &#8220;Whoa, there&#8217;s another one. Just like me, like Nathan!  [chuckles].&#8221; It kind of opened my eyes a little more to the idea that we do exist in this space and we do have an impact bigger than we kind of realize sometimes. We have an impact to our culture and to so many individuals around the world who find utility out of what we do. And from there, I tried to take what I was doing a lot more serious because I felt like I had a purpose to do it.</em></p>\n<p>I started to spend more time on my work, thinking of bigger ideas like things I could work on. Soon after, I emailed Aarron Walter at MailChimp. I went to Aarronwalter.com, sent him an email, said, &#8220;Hey, I really love what you guys do at MailChimp. I live in Atlanta. I really would love to chat and learn more about what you’re doing.&#8221; Never heard from him. He didn&#8217;t respond. I was like, &#8220;You know, it&#8217;s fine. You know, he&#8217;s a busy guy, whatever.&#8221;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I get to my senior year in college. The first semester of my senior year—in that summer prior I spent times talking with Nathan and figuring out things for what could be next. He just kind of told me, &#8220;being out in SF I&#8217;m looked at a certain way because I&#8217;m basically your age and I&#8217;ve done a lot so far and I’m black. We need more of it. You need to keep doing it, you need to find your way.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After not hearing from Aarron Walter for a while, MailChimp had an opening on their website to hire a product designer. I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never been a product designer, but I&#8217;m going to apply and see what happens.&#8221; I applied on the first day of the semester. This was like September 2014. One of the recruiters looked at my LinkedIn like 20 minutes after I applied. I was like, &#8220;Woah!&#8221; I thought it was pretty fast. I didn&#8217;t know what to feel, but I was very excited. They ended up calling me like two days later and they invited me to the office They said,  &#8220;Hey, we really love your work.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Really? It&#8217;s not really shipped anywhere. It&#8217;s just me making stuff.&#8221; &#8220;No, we love it, we want you to talk to some people here.&#8221; So I met with a couple of engineers, a couple of recruiters. I basically got through the interview process and my last interview was Aaron Walter and I was just like, &#8220;Whoa,&#8221; [chuckles]. I was like, &#8220;Really? I&#8217;m going to sit with Aarron Walter?&#8221; Because before I was there, when I was doing my interviews, they were like, &#8220;Yeah, Aarron kind of like does his own thing, works on his own projects. He&#8217;s doing like a secret thing right now.&#8221; So I&#8217;m like, &#8220;OK, he&#8217;s probably like the guy I&#8217;ll never see.&#8221; Then when the recruiter called me and was like, &#8220;Yeah, as the last step, Aarron Walter wants to meet you.&#8221; I was just like, &#8220;What?&#8221; It was really cool. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I met with Aaron and I was just brutally honest with him. I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m super excited about this stuff. I want to do it. I want to continue to grow. I need to be on a team in order to do that and feel like I&#8217;m growing and do this in sort of a system.&#8221; I just kind of told him, &#8220;You know, I&#8217;m a student. I don&#8217;t want to be there. I want to make things. He kind of nodded his head at a lot of stuff. I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know where this is going.&#8221; But I was honest with him. I can&#8217;t be upset with myself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I want to say the next morning the lead recruiter at MailChimp emailed me at 6 AM and said like, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;d love to talk to you on the phone soon.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; She called me later that day and she said, &#8220;Yeah, Aaron Walter loved you. He like raved about you.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;What [chuckles]?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Really?&#8221; She was like, &#8220;Oh yeah. And also, Aaron Walter is working on a special project with about three other MailChimp employees and they want you to do it with them.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s a lot.&#8221; But I was like, &#8221; yeah, of course. I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started working at MailChimp. Haha.  My first day, we were literally in a room; there was three of us, me, Aaron&#8211; Aaron didn&#8217;t even have a desk. He was just at a table. Federico, one of the UX developers, and Fernando, who&#8217;s a researcher. I was literally thrown into something I had wanted to do for so long. I didn&#8217;t really have a plan. I just kind of learned it at MailChimp. I enjoyed it. I think Ben Chestnut and Dan Kurzius are some of the greatest cofounders I&#8217;ve ever met. They&#8217;re really awesome. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was also fascinated that MailChimp does have more African-American employees than a lot of places. I was one of the only African-Americans working on the products. There were other African-Americans there, but they were like support. And I was like, &#8220;What is happening? What is going on?&#8221; I was thinking, &#8220;There&#8217;s got to be some reason why this is happening. I really don&#8217;t know.&#8221; I think that&#8217;s a story that a lot of people need to hear because </span><em>every job I go to, I&#8217;m very excited to start it. I&#8217;m just going into a world that&#8217;s not the same as mine but we all have this passion for building things.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It was kind of fascinating, I&#8217;m sitting there thinking at MailChimp</span><b>, </b><em>&#8220;How many other kids are like me, at all—still in school and interested in a creative space, interested in apps, interested in making things but they feel like no one like them is doing it?”</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even to this day, it&#8217;s totally become very frustrating, but I love that it&#8217;s becoming a focus now. People are starting to pay attention to it. I still think talking about it and acting on it are very different things, but I definitely think it&#8217;s in a better place now. I mean I&#8217;ve had a fun run so far. I&#8217;m 22, but I just wonder how many companies I&#8217;m going to go to and be the only one. Or the second. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think back to a few days ago, Kanye was being Kanye and tweeted something like—everybody in SF is listening to rap music. It&#8217;s a very true statement. It&#8217;s amazing to see this whole culture become so big in Silicon Valley now. The diversity numbers don&#8217;t reflect the culture that everybody wants to be a part of, everybody wants to portray. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Why does everybody like it? We don&#8217;t get to work everywhere, feel accepted everywhere.&#8221; It&#8217;s weird but I definitely think it&#8217;s not by mistake that we&#8217;re so impactful. I think Silicon Valley has such a fun opportunity right now to do something.</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m curious to know more about your experience—not just being black in tech, but being young talent as well</b></p>\n<p>So my age has never been a serious issue fortunately. Although I have had some bumps in the road. When I left MailChimp I was told things like, “I want you to experience more.” At the time it came across differently. To me it sounded like, are you saying that because I&#8217;m 21 and I have to go to school tomorrow or are you just saying as critical feedback.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other thing is burning out. I personally feel being a designer in tech in my early 20’s kind of has a bittersweet effect on me. I have no idea what I want to do at 25. Even some days now I just want to walk around my apartment listening to Young Thug through my Sonos system. Nothing more. Most days I just want to work from home and watch Keeping Up With the Kardashians. Some days I just want to tweet. I want to make sure I enjoy my 20’s. That’s the point here. Do I want to make apps in five years?  Because I&#8217;ve been doing it for the past two years professionally? It&#8217;s only been a couple years of me actually shipping things. Do I want to do this later, when most people are finishing up grad school, really getting their career started. Do I want to retire at 26? Like a lot of people will be designing for the newest iPhone, whatever size it is. The newest tablet, etc. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll do that. And it&#8217;s very scary because for the few years I&#8217;ve based my life off of this. I love products, I want to make products. Now I don&#8217;t know what the future is. What the product is. I told myself I may not want to open sketch, I may get sick of it. I think there are much bigger problems we can solve for. I strongly believe women deserve a lot more. I want to build things for them and I currently am. Autonomous driving and automotive UI’s also interest me very much. Building around cancer is very close to me without question. </span></p>\n<p><em>I’ll be honest—it isn’t all just about apps, valuations, and startups anymore. I lost my father in September to cancer and my family has taken a much bigger role in my day to day. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So has staying in Atlanta. For years I didn’t see the reality that is now in front of me. You know, I&#8217;ve talked to all those companies that you get to visit all the time and go shoot at. </span><em>Like I talk to them, and the question comes down to, &#8220;Justin do you want to come to SF, New York, London, Seattle?&#8221; It&#8217;s like, I would love to, but I can&#8217;t do it. It’s not the right situation for me. You know, my family circumstances have changed, and I’m in Atlanta. Two years ago I would have been like, &#8220;Yeah, of course I’ll move to SF.&#8221; San Francisco was a dream of mine since 2011. Nah, it doesn&#8217;t work for me anymore. It&#8217;s very tough. </em></p>\n<p><b>What advice would you have to guys with similar backgrounds to you, like maybe young people of color, who are really interested in tech but just feel like it&#8217;s impossible to get into it?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tech is one of those things where if you really believe you can—engineers and people in tech will tell you all the time, everything is possible. If I believe I can design something, I know it can be built. </span><em>I think staying passionate and staying curious is very important. Try things, meet people, and just really care about what you&#8217;re doing. That&#8217;s really what helped me. I think there&#8217;s a light at the end of the tunnel, you just have to want it bad enough and you have to really believe that people of color do have a place. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I mean, you can do it. </span><em>Tristan Walker can’t carry the torch forever. There are far too many more problems out there. Although he has helped lay an amazing foundation. We need so many more who are passionate and willing to build things for the future.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b></b><b>Let&#8217;s start from the beginning. Tell me about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Early years, how early are we talking?</span></p>\n<p><b>Where were you born?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born in the exotic land of San Jose, just 45 minutes south of here. My parents are Vietnamese, so, I&#8217;m Vietnamese-American. San Jose is supposed to be the largest population of Vietnamese outside of Vietnam, I think.</span></p>\n<p><b>How did you end up in Texas?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My parents moved my brother and I when was 16. I like to say that I’m born and raised in the Bay Area, and then misplaced in Texas. They kind of just gave us a month&#8217;s notice before we left. Just, &#8220;Oh, and we&#8217;re moving to Texas. Pack up your things, say bye to your friends.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more interesting version of this story is that my mom followed a monk there. I’m not sure if that’s true, really – that’s what my aunties told me. My mom is incredibly Buddhist, she&#8217;s super religious, so it’s completely believable that she followed a monk to Texas. I think the less interesting story is that, financially, it was easier to move to Texas and sustain living there. We moved at a rough time for me and I was pretty distraught. At the time, I had just finished my sophomore year and was coming in as a junior. I was about to be an upperclassman in the food chain of high school. I had found my group of friends and was starting to become stable with my identity. We had such little notice and had to start over in Texas. For a long time, I resented my parents for it and really didn’t understand their decision.</span></p>\n<p><b>What was it like growing up in conservative Texas after being in California?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of the population in San Jose is Asian and Hispanic, and that’s really all I knew growing up. </span><em>Coming to Texas, we moved to a small town northwest of Houston. If you drove for 30 minutes, you hit Confederate flags. I experienced culture shock, what I recognize as culture shock, years after. I think what I&#8217;ve come to understand, is my place and identity as a daughter of immigrants. San Jose had been full of Vietnamese, and so the culture I carried with me was more easily integrated into my day-to-day. Now, all of a sudden I was in Texas, where many of my common practices and cultural norms felt wholly out of place. It made me very self aware and, for a while, it tormented me. It added complexity to the already difficult experience of being a teenager trying to figure out my own identity. And to this day, I remain consciously aware of my heritage and feel the pressure to carry on those traditions.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> But I embrace it, and have been learning to balance the two. I speak fluent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_language\" target=\"_blank\">Vietnamese</a>, I can read and write probably at the level of a kindergartener, and am really happy and somewhat prideful when it comes to sharing traditions.</span></p>\n<p><b>Eventually, you came back here?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I&#8217;m a designer now. I’m an experience designer at Airbnb. I had always been interested in graphic design. </span><em>When I was a kid, I loved this virtual pet website, <a href=\"http://www.neopets.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Neopets</a>, and designing “Neopet banners,” which were banners for your pet’s webpage. I started to learn HTML and CSS that way, adding snippets of code to my pet page.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And then it grew to designing blogs like Xangas, Myspace, and Livejournals. I was always “revamping my blog”, my angsty teen blog. And then posting about angsty teen things.</span></p>\n<p><b>Did you have an animated cursor?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, animated cursor, some marquees, and the Friends theme song that automatically played when you got there. I remember in high school I also loved books, and I had navigated my way through the internet to find maybe five percent off books. I would buy and sell these books, not even making money off of it, probably spending more money than making any, so I could deliver my friends our favorite books with some well designed receipts.</span></p>\n<p><b>Did you know that you would pursue tech or design as your adult thing?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I always wanted to be a graphic designer. I just loved what I was doing. I eventually started entering crowdsourced competitions. I remember finding <a href=\"http://99designs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">99designs</a>, which is now the bane of existence for designers. But when I was around 17, I would submit logos and win once or twice. And I was like, &#8220;$50! I&#8217;m going to be rich!&#8221; </span><em>I had always wanted to be a designer, but my parents never really supported arts degrees. And as immigrants they kind of frowned upon it. Now, looking back, I understand, and really respect my parents for having their American Dream, and trying to give me the shortcut to success. I recognize it now, but before it was just, “Why won&#8217;t you let me do what I love to do?” They were always pushing the suggestion of more typically successful careers, becoming a doctor, lawyer, something that requires a PhD. My parents frowned upon it so I pursued it on my own.</em></p>\n<p><b>You pursued it on your own time, and then you ended up doing something totally different in college.</b></p>\n<p>Yeah. I left home at 17. My mom and I had a really rough argument. It had been a struggle with my parents and it was a long time coming. My parents are very traditional and they&#8217;re very strict. They kind of pushed suggestions on my behavior, my identity, passions, way of living, and expectations of living. I never felt like I did anything right and I never felt like their expectations of perfection were achievable. I was rebellious, confused about who I was, what I wanted to do, and felt like my own voice didn’t exist with them.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also had this idea of respect, that when they had their say, even if they were wrong, any sort of response, even a correction through a miscommunication, is considered talking back and disrespectful. This was their definition of respecting elders. Eventually I got tired of having to hold my tongue, and that’s when I became rebellious and defiant. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m the eldest. I have a younger brother, and I always say they consider him the golden child. As the oldest, you&#8217;re the guinea pig. Whatever you do is always wrong, and they&#8217;ll adjust their parenting methods and they will treat my brother better. </span></p>\n<p><b>I remember that in my family [chuckles].</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. </span></p>\n<p><b>It sucks.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can relate? </span></p>\n<p><b>Totally. So you bounced?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. I left early. I forgot the question. Sorry. [laughter]</span></p>\n<p><b>This is all leading up to college? And doing something different in college than design?</b></p>\n<p>Long story short, I ended up going to school at the University of Houston. I had initially pursued Architecture and then Marketing, looking for a major that would satisfy my love for design, but still would set me off on the right foot in terms of a career. I eventually ended up in Management Information Systems. I thought that since I wasn’t going to study design, I would study something that supplemented it. And through MIS, I studied more coding languages, learned about database architectures, and practiced project management.</p>\n<p><b>And then from there, how did you end up in Silicon Valley?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By that time I had left home, I was already freelancing. I had made logos, built websites, done some branding work. I was also juggling two or three jobs, like hosting and waitressing, trying to sustain myself through college. Instead of finding project management jobs through my major, I would attend the same career fairs, but pitch myself as a designer. I made connections with people who were trying to hire students for project management jobs and ended up designing their websites, or working on their brand and identity. Word of mouth spread and I kept building websites and designing identities for start-ups, corporate companies, and restaurants in Texas. That&#8217;s how I started my portfolio.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since I had moved, all I wanted to do was come back to the Bay. Growing up in Texas, as I established friendships and found my own identity, I recognized what I wanted to do and where I could do it best was where I wanted to be – back in the Bay Area. </span><em>Getting a job out here was hard. I applied to every design job I could find. I would fly back here pretty often just to attend events and network with people. I had business cards and a resume ready. I had even made a Google Voice phone number with a 650 area code so people would think I lived here, so that the idea of me living elsewhere wouldn’t keep me from getting a job. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each time before I flew out, I did research on companies to find out who was hiring. Then when I got here, I would stop by their offices, drop off my resume, and let them know I was interested in the job.  A lot of times I just cold contacted people. I used LinkedIn to email recruiters, let them know that I was interested in their company, the jobs that they had open, and forwarded them my portfolio and resume. </span><em>I was turned down or ignored a majority of the time, but ended up landing a job at Playstation.</em></p>\n<p><b>Awesome. What was your first experiences like working in Silicon Valley?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had grown up loving video games through my brother, so I was ecstatic when I received the internship offer. I worked as a Web Developer Intern for their Developer Operations. Even after working at companies in Texas, I thought Playstation was incredibly corporate, especially in comparison to today’s tech companies. It was my first introduction to working at a large company and designing for a company whose product I used and admired.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly I wasn’t sure what I had expected. I think I thought it was my dream job. I was given a travel stipend, housing, and it was a paid internship. I made great connections with people in the industry who I still keep in touch with. I really couldn’t have asked for more.</span></p>\n<p><b>Then, LinkedIn after that?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not yet. When I had my internship at Playstation I was still in school, but I managed to connect with my professors and was really honest with them. I let them know that I was working and would be absent a lot, wouldn’t be attending a lot of classes either, but I promised that I would catch up on all the lectures, do my homework, and make it to all the exams. After most of the internships had ended at Playstation, I extended my internship for another couple of months and worked there even though school had started. When I came back to school later in the Fall, I got an internship at a design agency in Houston.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was nearing graduation and had applied at a bunch of jobs at tech companies, with no luck. A friend of one of my co-interns at Playstation worked for LinkedIn referred me there. I remember having a whole week of finals at the time and I hadn’t told the agency I was working for then that I was interviewing. I ducked out, flew out here, and was offered an internship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was actually an incredible experience. This was my first time being at a full fledged tech company. I met so so many incredible people with all different kinds of backgrounds and experience. I was offered a full time job on my very last day as an intern. My manager at the time decided not to tell me that I was getting the job and made me worry and scramble for a new job until the very last minute. He decided to tell me the day of, the day that I was leaving, that I got the job.</span></p>\n<p><b>Oh man.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah! I stayed at LinkedIn for three years. Looking back now, the connections I&#8217;ve made, the people that I had met, and just the experience I had were irreplaceable.</span></p>\n<p><b>And then that leads you to where you are now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mm-hmm, yeah.</span></p>\n<p><b>Awesome. What have been some of the highlights for you, just for your overall tech experience?  </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So there are two things. I think the biggest thing that I had learned even from the beginning, flying out here and networking with people, and then working with so many people is that, </span><em>even though we’re all in tech, everyone has a different story about how they&#8217;ve gotten here, what they&#8217;re doing, how they&#8217;re doing it and why they&#8217;re doing it. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the same way that I think you&#8217;re interviewing people, it&#8217;s just&#8211; the people you meet&#8211; <em>y</em></span><em>ou’ll never meet the same person twice. I’m constantly blown away and often inspired.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second thing is being able to learn from everyone and everything.</span><em> I think not coming from a traditional design background, I feel at a disadvantage. But you learn from being on the job day to day and being around so many talented people. You learn through guidance but also through osmosis, I think, from being around these incredible people. I’m always open to learning and trying new things and I’m so excited that there are endless possibilities and opportunities here.</em></p>\n<p><b>What have been some of the biggest challenges?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wouldn&#8217;t say the challenges I’ve faced aren&#8217;t necessarily caused by tech, but that they’ve been brought into the light through it. I’ve already mentioned that my parents were incredibly traditional and strict. They were tiger parents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They had me learn every possible skill, hobby, sport. I played tennis, I played piano, swam, Tae Kwon Do, clarinet, basketball, badminton, a million things. They threw every possible skill at my velcro wall of life to see what stuck. I had started piano when I was 4 and played for 18 years.</span></p>\n<p><em>My parents’ style of teaching and encouragement was through discouragement with an expectation of perfection.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think one of the things that I remember the most was when I was learning piano, my auntie &#8211; my mom&#8217;s sister &#8211; was my teacher. I was playing a song during a private lesson and I wasn’t doing too well. My family friend, who was also a student and a child prodigy, was also there. My auntie asked me to play it a second time, and this time, have the family friend count how many mistakes I made. And then they asked him to show me how it was supposed to be done and play it correctly. And it was kind of like that all of my life, always being encouraged through discouragement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through my upbringing I recognize that I’ve developed self-esteem and self-consciousness issues, where I have this need for reassurance or recognition, whether it be my parents, employers, or managers and I have this need to strive for the utmost perfection. </span></p>\n<p><em>What I&#8217;m constantly learning is that I don&#8217;t need to satisfy anybody else&#8217;s criteria of whether or not I&#8217;m succeeding. </em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my experience, I’ve come across personalities that are egotistical, flashing around their title, that would speak from a perspective of authority rather than a place of humility and empathy. And in my self-conscious nature, I’m always cautious, always thinking that I’ve done something wrong. If there was a negative comment I would always think, &#8220;Was it me? Was it something I did?&#8221; Rather than realizing that it may not be anyone’s fault at all. I always took the blame or I always took it personally. That&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve been trying to overcome. </span></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Imposter syndrome</a> is one of the biggest things I recognize in myself. I&#8217;m always thinking, &#8220;It’s a matter of time. They&#8217;re going to find out tomorrow that I’m not exactly as good as I’ve presented myself and that I&#8217;m actually not supposed to be here.&#8221; </em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what I&#8217;ve come to acknowledge is that these are things that I&#8217;ve actually achieved. I need to take a step back and celebrate my successes and where I&#8217;ve gotten, rather than counting all of my misses and what I&#8217;ve done wrong. Not only that, but considering those things as stepping stones to getting where I need to go, as points of growth rather than, &#8220;This is where I f&#8217;d up.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In tech there is a battle of titles, compensation, experience, all kinds of things. And it’s so easy to feel beaten down by someone else’s ego and to want to compare yourself to them. But I’ve realized that it’s not about me or anyone else, it’s about how I’m doing for myself. </span></p>\n<p><b>Was there a person or a moment or an event that switched that for you? A kind of epiphany of just like, I don&#8217;t have to count my mistakes, I don&#8217;t have to worry about these people thinking that I&#8217;m not worthy or that I&#8217;m not doing it right. Was there a moment where you&#8217;re like, &#8220;I&#8217;m doing fine?&#8221;</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t think that it was an epiphany really, I think it’s been a long time coming. When I was at LinkedIn, the director of design, now VP of design at LinkedIn, was a mentor to me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I remember I had really messed up my interview at LinkedIn, I had bombed my interview so badly and I knew it. I had lost my design challenge the morning of my presentation, came late to the interview, frazzled, shirt buttoned incorrectly, like, &#8220;Oh my God, I&#8217;m so sorry. I messed this up.&#8221; I walked through my presentation, my portfolio, and spent the entire day interviewing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the afternoon, the director came in, he could tell from my posture &#8211; he&#8217;s really good at reading body language &#8211; he knew I was defeated. He was honest and said bluntly, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to tell you the truth. I don&#8217;t know if the team thinks you&#8217;re qualified enough to be full-time on this team. If we do hire you, we&#8217;re looking at an internship. If not, I can give you advice on what you can do to improve.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And I actually really appreciated his honesty. He was straightforward and said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s just cut the bullshit. Tell me how your day was. Tell me how you feel.&#8221; And we just kind of talked through the experience. He told me that it&#8217;s either an internship or maybe it won&#8217;t work out, but, whatever happened he would personally contact me and give me advice as to what to do next. Three weeks later he gave me a call and told me, &#8220;You have an internship. I want you to learn from the team and become better. This is your job to lose.&#8221; That&#8217;s how he became my mentor and my internship at LinkedIn started.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through my experiences at LinkedIn, often times I felt like I wasn’t achieving enough, felt beaten down by failures that you inevitably go through. I took that personally as I normally did, and he helped me rationalize my thoughts, made me think objectively. &#8220;Did you really do this? How can you improve? These are the right emotions that you&#8217;ve gone through. There’s no one to judge you but yourself.” He helped mentor me through my self-esteem and self-consciousness to see my successes and that failures aren’t truly failures. I’m incredibly grateful for that.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are your biggest motivators? What drives you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a while I think I was lost. My biggest goal since I had moved was to come back to the Bay Area. So when I worked for LinkedIn, I had achieved my biggest goal, “I’m back in the San Francisco Bay Area, now what?” And for the longest time I was trying to figure out what’s next for me, my next milestones, and figuring out what I wanted to achieve. I know that I want to leave an impression somehow but how do I do it? I think that&#8217;s why I stayed at LinkedIn for a long time, because it was stable, and safe. Familiar. </span></p>\n<p>I think I had finally reached a point at my job there where I felt like it wasn&#8217;t enough for me anymore and that I wasn’t growing as much as I wanted to and eventually I moved to my job now, at Airbnb.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For me, I think motivation is, always learning, always feeling challenged and most of all fulfilling my passions, doing things that make me happy and that I’m proud of. That’s what always keeps me going.</span></p>\n<p><b>What do you think about the state of tech now, in 2016? What excites you? What frustrates you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think what we lack sometimes is humility and an awareness for everything but tech. I think taking your experiences in tech and applying it as a perspective and viewpoint to learn is great, but I don’t think that it should be your only perspective. </span><em>I think both the design and tech scene gets caught up with itself and we forget a world outside of it exists.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think we foster great opportunities for anyone and everyone and that we have become more self aware of things like diversity and equal opportunity, making it a progressive industry that will only continue forward.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you think that your background and life experiences impact the way that you approach your work today?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thinking through my background and life lessons I have a couple of thoughts: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First—that we’re all imposters. I think we all feel like everyone else thinks we&#8217;re a better version of ourselves. I’ve learned to embrace my imposter, celebrate the achievements that make up the identity of my imposter because they are my own achievements. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, I’ve decided that perfection doesn’t exist, but I will always strive towards it. Thinking you&#8217;re perfect means that you’re accepting that you’ve reached the highest level anyone could ever achieve. That means you’re no longer open to learning and lack humility. I think that striving for perfection means that you’ll always be open to learning, to becoming better.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, </span><em>I like to remind myself to do what I’m passionate about and that I’m doing this for myself and not for anyone else.</em></p>\n<p><b>My last question to you would be, what advice would you give to people from similar backgrounds to you who are hoping to get into tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all have our insecurities. I always think about whether I&#8217;ll make it or worry about taking risks and whether or not this is the right time or the right step.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think my advice is to go for it. </span><em>Just because you’re taking a risk doesn’t mean you’re going to lose it all. Learning from your failures gives you a better chance the next time you take the risk. </em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And as an imposter I worry about not having had a background in design and that someone will find me out. I moved to San Francisco just on an internship with LinkedIn, not even a full time job. If I hadn’t done that I don’t think I would have gotten to where I am now. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My advice would be that, take the risk, acknowledge your imposter, succeed from your failures, and do what you love.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Well, like you, I took a non-traditional path into tech. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a child, my father ran a software company, so I was around technology a lot from a young age and really enjoyed it. I hung out at his company a lot. I remember taking a few programming classes in the &#8217;80s – community classes with mostly adults – and it was totally unusual to find a young girl in those kinds of classes. I liked it, but it was just another hobby. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was progressing through school, I became really interested in science and that turned into an interest in Genomics pretty early. I wanted to be a geneticist, probably a doctor, and that was the plan. So I went to Ohio State, which at the time was one of the best programs for under grads in genetics. That experience got me even more excited. From there, I went into research. My first job was at St. Jude Children&#8217;s Research Hospital, the cancer hospital in Memphis, I worked in research for four years, and my plan was to get closer to the work, find out what interested me most and go back to school to get my PhD or my MD and be a research scientist. But when I got into the work, I actually didn&#8217;t find it that interesting. I found the subject really interesting, but the day-to-day didn’t stimulate me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dot com boom was happening around that time, so Silicon Valley was getting a lot of attention. Programmers and computer scientists were getting a lot of attention. And I remember thinking, “I did that as a kid. It was a lot of fun, and I was good at it.” That seemed like a really exciting career to be in, where there wasn&#8217;t this ceiling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s the other thing about research – it doesn&#8217;t pay very well, and that really bothered me. I wanted to be in a field where the sky’s the limit, and hearing about all of these entrepreneurs out in Silicon Valley got me really excited. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I didn&#8217;t know anyone out there. My exposure was literally from the news. I got really lucky, because this new field was emerging called bioinformatics – basically a merge of biology and computer science. A company called Celera was getting a lot of press because they were sequencing the human genome and racing to make this data available to scientists. It was the Human Genome Project. This project generated an enormous amount of data. This was big data before anyone called it big data, and that data needed to be mined. There was a need for people who could not only understand biology and the data and the science, but also write scripts and programs. That was perfect. I was already thinking about computer science, and now there&#8217;s this way I could segue from biology.</span></p>\n<p>I started applying to companies in the Bay Area, Celera in particular. Celera was my target, my dream. I thought that would&#8217;ve been the most amazing thing in the world. I applied, I called, I harassed them and applied some more. After a lot of brute-force effort, they hired me, and I relocated from Tennessee to the Bay Area. It was a complete dream job – especially since, by this time, we were in the dot-com bust and not many people were traveling west. I was at Celera for around 4 years working on really interesting and high-profile projects, but I completely fell in love with computer science, so I went back to school in the evenings and got my MS in Computer Science.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being an engineer in the Valley is a very empowering thing. You identify a problem and write code to solve that problem. It’s very gratifying. I started to become very entrepreneurial. I met my eventual co-founder at Celera, and the time was right for us to dive in head-first and start a company. And the funny thing about it is that we didn&#8217;t actually know what we were going to start. It wasn&#8217;t like, &#8220;I have an idea. I need to go start a company.&#8221; It was more, &#8220;I need to start a company, and I&#8217;ll find the right idea later.&#8221; I talk to a lot to entrepreneurs, and they always say, “I don&#8217;t know if my idea&#8217;s good enough.” And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t have to be, because you&#8217;re going to change your idea 10 times.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our first idea that really took off was a company called Spitfire Photo. It was a solution for photographers and, specifically, small, independent agencies around the world that covered global events. We were getting decent traction, but soon realized the market is relatively small and slow growing. We struggled for several years to accelerate it and eventually made the decision to pivot to an enterprise offering after seeing some adoption within organizations. So in 2010, Spitfire Photo became WebDAM. My co-founder and I actually built the first version of the product. There weren’t any other cloud solutions that could do what we doing for enterprises, and it really took off from there. We never raised outside funding, and we were eventually acquired in 2014. </span></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s really amazing. So let&#8217;s step back. I&#8217;d love to hear more about your experience of fundraising and what was disenchanting to you and what fed into that idea of &#8220;let&#8217;s hold off.&#8221;</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right. Well, it was a lot of things. The first investors we approached were definitely top-tier, and we were very early stage and still refining our market fit. There were lots of learnings that came out of those conversations, but it became very clear to us that we should grow the business further before fundraising. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was one thing, and two – and this is much more clear in hindsight – the Valley was completely male dominated and a very different experience than it is now. Today, being a female in tech is talked about and, as an investor, you have to be aware of the gender disparities and potential biases and operate with a certain level of sensitivity around the topic. But back then? Definitely not. </span></p>\n<p>The other thing about it is – and this is something that I literally just started talking about in the past year, we went 10 years without ever really talked publicly about it – my co-founder is my husband. Early on, when we started the company and people knew we were married, people would say, &#8220;Can I talk to your husband?&#8221; As if I was his assistant or something! I decided at that point it was not going to define me and became very private about it. Back then, many investors were strongly opposed to investing in married couples.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can understand that risk, but having a co-founder is like being married. You don’t need a marriage certificate to have disagreements, fights and break-ups – co-founders have fall-out all the time. Interestingly, as more women are jumping into entrepreneurship, we are seeing more and more married co-founders. It’s more accepted. But at the time it was very discouraged, so much so that the second time we started looking for funding I would seek out women investors. That was very unusual for me, because </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve worked in male-dominated industries my entire life and I&#8217;ve never felt like it mattered much. Even when I felt bias, I was like, &#8220;Whatever. I&#8217;m excited to prove you wrong.&#8221; It just never really affected me negatively. But the second time around I said, &#8220;I really want to find women investors, because I think they&#8217;re going to be more empathetic and open minded.” And in my experience, they were. We were finally well positioned to raise when we started to get approached about acquisition and the conversations changed.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>How did your life change as an entrepreneur and the head of a company once kids came into the picture?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have two kids. My first was born right when we pivoted away from Spitfire Photo to WebDAM. Maternity leave was actually very refreshing. My mind was clearer to think creatively about other options. That&#8217;s important for any entrepreneur – to find that space to think clearly. Maternity leave was my space, my time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I struggled to be a “normal” mom, though. I joined moms groups to meet other new moms and did baby yoga and noon stroller walks. At first it was amazing. It seemed I had a life again. But when it came time for all my “mom friends” to go back to work, I was the only one that did. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone else decided to stay at home, but for me that meant shutting down the business. That was a turning point for me and I started to think differently about how I could combine my loves. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work-life balance wasn’t going to be possible, so I turned to work-life integration. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I focused on teaching my son about business and software starting at a young age. I wanted him to know the company, understand it, know what I did, get excited about it, be familiar with it, know who works there. I just wanted it to be part of his life too, because it was clear it was going to be a very important part of our lives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have since had a second child, a daughter. And they both walk into WebDAM and know the team by their first names. We have ping pong tables and video games, and they would rather go there than anywhere else after school. Of course, it&#8217;s like any other office and we don&#8217;t have kids running around during the day, but there are late nights where the kids are having a pizza party while the team is having a hackathon. It has become an important part of their lives, too.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you think that experience has shaped your approach to work and your priorities? What about your management style?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s tough because I think, for most entrepreneurs, it&#8217;s not work. It&#8217;s a lifestyle. It&#8217;s my hobby, my passion. It&#8217;s everything. Even if I wanted to totally separate it or be like, &#8220;My kids are going to be my only priority,&#8221; it&#8217;s still my passion. That was new to me – I didn&#8217;t know that about myself. That&#8217;s why I think being able to involve them in different ways within the business has become so important. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I actually became much more empathetic to women in the workplace once I was a mom. There was a time when I found it difficult to understand how people could not be 150% invested in their careers – crazy, right? Becoming a mom changed the way I think about other people and how everyone has competing priorities, whatever they are. It&#8217;s not my job to judge what should be your priorities, but it is my job to help make it work. That changed a lot for me.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Running a business for 10 years has also increased my awareness and empathy. You come across all sorts of people from all walks of life and start to notice themes. For instance, it became very apparent that women are less inclined to participate in large meetings, always taking a back seat. As a woman CEO, this really bothered me – it’s not like they are the only women in the room? I struggled with confidence myself in the past, but didn’t realize what a systemic problem it was until I managed a large team and saw the staggering differences.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, and I&#8217;m curious to know your thoughts on how do you undo that? When that kind of damage has done over and over and over for so many of these women and other folks who have been in tack and then they come to a company like yours that is better, just because of your experience and you running it, how do you un-train them to actually believe in themself again?</b></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s very hard, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s just from work experience. I think it starts really, really early. At least that was the case for me. Part of the reason it took us five years to pivot was because I had some fundamental confidence issues and an inability to trust my instincts.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not to be overly optimistic, but I do think it was a bigger issue in my generation, give or take 10 years. I was raised in a society where most moms stayed at home. Our dads were the breadwinners. Men and women held very specific roles. My kid&#8217;s generation is seeing a totally different view of women. I&#8217;m very hopeful that time will sort out a lot of the unconscious bias. This is why it’s more important than ever for women to ignore the voices of doubt in our heads and forge forward. The next generation is counting on us. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At WebDAM, we started a group called Women of WebDAM (WOW), for exactly this purpose: Come together and support one another. I don&#8217;t get a lot of face time with most of the team anymore, and I missed it, so this group provides a way for us to lean on a support network. Sometimes we just go to a wine bar and have wine and talk. Sometimes we&#8217;ll do book club, sometimes we&#8217;ll go to a networking event or a women&#8217;s film festival, whatever it is. But it&#8217;s a time for us to get together and have those conversations, and it&#8217;s been incredible. Honestly, it&#8217;s been as rewarding for me as anyone on the team.</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m curious: as an entrepreneur, where did you get your resourcefulness from? You jumped from science to computer science to business, and you decided to start your own company and you&#8217;re planning to sell to all these clients. What was your process for learning what to do?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resourcefulness has definitely been a critical skill over the years, as it is for any entrepreneur. I think it comes from a few places. One, I think I am just naturally a problem solver. As a child, the first database I wrote was to categorize my clothing by color and season. It sounds super neurotic now, but it seemed like a totally appropriate thing to do with the Wang business computer my dad brought home from work. I will also say that, even though my parents had traditional gender roles, they were very empowering. There was not a day that went by that I didn&#8217;t believe I could do anything I wanted to. And that meant being an astronaut, an actor – the sky was the limit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My years as a scientist were certainly influential as well. Science teaches you perseverance – digging deeper and deeper into a problem and constantly exploring new untapped avenues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And last, I have always been relentless in my pursuit of success. I’m not sure where this stemmed from, though I do know that my resourcefulness developed a great deal during the five-year period when we were trying every possible means to accelerate the growth of the business before eventually pivoting.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in five or 10 years? Do you think you&#8217;ll still be in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No doubt. I love the tech industry. I really love it. I’ll probably either be growing a business or advising and investing in startups. Or perhaps both. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love hearing other entrepreneur’s stories and being part of a rapidly changing landscape. It&#8217;s just a really cool place to be and, being in the Valley, it never gets old and it’s always changing. You&#8217;re always meeting someone who is doing something interesting. </span></p>\n<p><b>Absolutely. Let&#8217;s see, if you want to dive into anything else let me know, but my last question to you would be just what major lessons have you learned and what advice would you want to give to aspiring female entrepreneurs?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think the biggest one that took me a really long time to learn was that nobody knows what you should do. Even if someone has done it before, even if someone has done it over and over again, it doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re right about what you should do with your company. Trusting our instincts became really important for us. There are so many different ways to achieve your goals in business – ask five people what you should do about a problem in your business and you&#8217;ll probably get five different opinions. Every product is different. Every market is different. Economic conditions are constantly changing. So I think it&#8217;s important to get really close to your market, really close to whomever your customer is, because that&#8217;s when you&#8217;re going to be able to develop the instincts and know what to do. You&#8217;re the one talking to the customer.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Why don&#8217;t we start from the beginning? Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure. I was born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, born in Copacabana, like the song, which is a real neighborhood in Rio. Moved out of Copacabana to one of the suburbs of downtown Rio, but still within the city and lived there until I was 17. Had a pretty regular middle class upbringing in Rio. My dad is in the military. My mom was self-employed/artist, so she taught painting to middle aged women as kind of like almost like art therapy sort of thing. She always said it was a place for middle aged women to come and chat and kind of air their grievances, and in the meantime create something beautiful and then go home with it.</span></p>\n<p><b>Amazing.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was pretty chill. Went to private school, which is what we do in Brazil since the public system&#8217;s not very good. Spent most of my time playing soccer, avoiding homework. Eventually started playing music, so that changed a little bit. My teen years I started going more into—stopped playing some of the soccer, did even less homework, and spent most of my time in garages or with people who were into mostly American music in fact, and just making music, having a very typical teenage years until my family moved to the U.S. We can go into that in a minute, because I feel like those are no longer my early years. I want to give you a second to ask any further questions on that, but yeah, it was a pretty nice and safe upbringing, good supportive family, no plans of really living abroad at all. I come from a family of a long standing admirals and people from the Navy, so my father, my father&#8217;s father, my uncles were all in the Navy, and there was a little bit of pressure for me to go into that, but I quickly jumped down, wasn&#8217;t quite a good fit. Yeah. I can go into more details if you&#8217;d like to know more, but I think, yeah, it was a pretty straight forward upbringing, pretty happy one.</span></p>\n<p><b>You kind of just touched on it, but what did your parents expect you to be or do when you grew up? Was their any family pressure?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. From my dad&#8217;s side. Nothing crazy, but there was definitely a certain level of expectation that I would go into the military. My dad was a one star admiral. My grandfather was a four star admiral, who eventually was the secretary of the Navy for the Brazilian president. I was named after him, so there was definitely some pressure of like following your grandfather&#8217;s footsteps, because I was named after him. I was really close to him obviously as well. There was a little bit of pressure there, but—Obviously I considered it. You don&#8217;t know, right? You always consider what your parents—or at least, I don&#8217;t know, I did. The more I learned about it I figured out that it wasn&#8217;t really the life for me, so I jumped out and decided—My mom never really had any expectations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a very interesting household in the sense that my father was always strict, military strict, with nothing crazy, but obviously he liked order, and following directions, and making plans and following them, while my mom was an artist, still is. You can imagine very different ways to decide on priorities, and make decisions, and decide what to do, which is not a surprise that they&#8217;ve been divorced twice from each other. They got divorced for a while. They remarried each other, and now they&#8217;re divorced again. It&#8217;s not a surprise that that&#8217;s what happened. My favorite stat is that my dad is on his third marriage, but only second wife. Yeah. From my dad&#8217;s side some expectation that I would go in the military. Took some convincing to say that I didn&#8217;t want to, but eventually he got it. From my mom&#8217;s side not so much. She just wanted me to be happy and figure out what I wanted to do.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. Did you have any inclinations at the time of what you want to do instead?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had no idea. I mean, the dream is always to go into music, right? A lot of my friends have in Brazil, which is awesome, super proud of them. I knew that I wasn&#8217;t quite good enough to do it, to cut it. I was good enough to hang out, and play, and make music, and have fun with it, nor did I really want to go through the lifestyle. I figured it&#8217;s kind of a brutal way to go through life. That was kind of the dream, right? Before that it was I want to be a soccer player. That&#8217;s what every single kid in Brazil wants to be. I was kind of good, but not good enough. Then after that I just kind of defaulted, was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ll work in corporate Brazil. I&#8217;ll get a business degree and work for a corporate or company and do something.&#8221; There was never a calling or anything like that.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, so you moved to the states by accident?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did. I did. It certainly wasn&#8217;t my plan. My dad was in the military. He got transferred to Washington D.C. for a couple years. It&#8217;s very common. For two years he was essentially a diplomat. He was representing the Brazilian Navy in an American Defense Board where they discussed threats to the American continent. There was an Army, a Navy, and an Air Force guy from every country from Canada to Chile, except for Cuba obviously. Every two years they switched the roster a little bit. My dad got sent out. As I mentioned before I had no plans. It was never a dream of the family to move to America. We have no roots here or nobody in the family ever lived here, but it was an opportunity. It was a cool one, and I was seventeen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then that really set off a number of events that changed my life. That was in 2002. I&#8217;ve been here now every since. I&#8217;m 31, so I&#8217;m almost at the point that I&#8217;m officially half and half, which will be a strange time whenever that happens. A lot of things happened. We were moving halfway through my senior year of high school in Brazil, which would have been July, 2002. Our academic year is flipped, because our summer break is in December, so It was halfway through my senior year. A lot of families go through this in the military, so we knew that if I left halfway through my senior year, I would have—In the past when that happened they used to send you back a year, so you would get here in July and start junior year of high school. I was like six months away from going to college, and if I didn&#8217;t do anything, I would have landed here and been pushed back essentially two years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I did was I dropped out of Brazilian high school after my junior year. You&#8217;re told my the military like a year in advance like, &#8220;This is your next post,&#8221; get your affairs in order sort of thing. I dropped out, and I just took the Brazilian GED. Then I had my high school finished, and then I moved here and went to community college. The idea was I will be here for a couple of years. I&#8217;ll get an associates, learn English, and go back. That was the plan.</span></p>\n<p><b>Wow. Walk me through the path you didn&#8217;t expect. You went to community college. There were some years in between, and then you ended up in a top five MBA program.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. Man, that&#8217;s a long time. What happened was I landed in D.C. I didn&#8217;t speak a lot of English. I spoke English as well as someone coming out of high school, in the US for example, would speak whatever second language they took.</span></p>\n<p><b>Horribly.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. Exactly. I was a committed student, but even then I could understand about fifty percent of what people were saying, and I could probably order a burger and kind of get the basic stuff out, but definitely overwhelming. I got here, and I enrolled in community college. I went to Montgomery College, just outside of D.C. where we were living. I got this job, which was totally .. Should I say with whom? Well, we can talk about that later. It was with an ice cream shop and it was totally under the table, because I didn&#8217;t have the papers to work, but I was over two years. What are they going to do, kick me out? I&#8217;m leaving in two years. Who cares, right? It was something that other Brazilians had done before. It was actually very common that because military families were coming in and out every two years, essentially there would always be opening in these companies, the businesses, that were willing to hire illegal workers anyway. You would come and just kind of fill in for the other high school age person who just moved back to Brazil essentially, so I did that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turned out I made really great friends, and they were all American. Most of the people I worked with were American, although there were a couple other Brazilian military kids, but they were mostly American. We became real friends. They were all senior year in high school, and they were all applying to college the next year. A lot of them went to amazing schools like Wash U, Kalamazoo College, Northwestern University, which is where I actually ended up at for a masters degree. I figured out they were my friends and they were like, &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you going to college?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. It was never part of the plan. I&#8217;m here for two years.&#8221;A year into I figured out a couple things. One is that if I got my associates and I went back to Brazil, none of that would have transferred, so I would have had to start college over again, which would have pushed me back five years. Whenever I literally have to start studying for the tests that are necessary to go to college in Brazil and so forth and so on. I was like, &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s another option, which is I can transfer here in the US and just study two more years and get a bachelor’s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the support of my friends, who were very well versed in the university application process in America, I figure out what I want to do and that I could do it, that I could transfer and I could complete it in two years. I decided that I wanted to do it. I sat my parents down and said, &#8220;This is what I want to do.&#8221; They looked at me and said, &#8220;That&#8217;s great, but we can&#8217;t help you really. Once we&#8217;re going back to Brazil we&#8217;re going to make money in reais again, which is the Brazilian currency, and there&#8217;s no way we can financially support you if you&#8217;re staying in the US for college for two more years.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Okay. Well, let me think this through.&#8221; I figured out that a lot of universities around the U.S. give scholarships to international students, because they&#8217;re in places like Nebraska, or Omaha, or whatever, and they need to attract international students. What I did essentially was I bought a U.S. News college rankings magazine and I essentially called every university on it to ask, &#8220;Do you have an international students scholarship?&#8221; I figured out a couple that did and some that I was interested in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I ended up applying to—and then I figured out later in the process—I knew I had to apply by like January 15th to be accepted for the fall, and then I was like, &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s this thing you got to do. It&#8217;s the SAT.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Ah, fuck. I had to study for the SAT in like two weeks, and take it, and get a good enough score to apply and build this whole application portfolio. I&#8217;m sure you know about getting your grades in order, get your SAT score, get your recommendation letters, write essays for applications, and all kinds of stuff. I did all of that and ended up applying to a couple of schools. I made some connections before since I called them with the international students affairs deans or whatever, provost, depending on the university. Ended up getting accepted into a small liberal arts school two and a half hours outside of Chicago called Illinois Wesleyan University, who gave me enough of a scholarship, it was about seventy percent, to go there for two more years. It was an easy decision. One of my best friends was going to Wash U. My girlfriend at the time was going to to Northwestern. I had a friend at Kalamazoo College. I was like, well my family&#8217;s leaving the East coast, I have no roots in America, so I might as well go close to where my friends are.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got accepted and went to school for two more years. Graduated in 2006 with a sub par GPA, but in the green nonetheless and got a shitty job out of undergraduate. It was 2006, and I was doing customer service/sales support at Motorola, which even at the time was just after the Razr phase. Even then they were already starting to decline. I was working on the federal practice. It was really boring. Here&#8217;s the business that I was in. You know those radios that cops walk around with? That was the business I was supporting. You could not be more boring and stuffy. Anyway, it was a job, and it gave me a visa, and allowed me to stay. Eighteen months into it I was like, &#8220;I hate it. I need to get out.&#8221; I jumped ship, and I went to a company called Mintel. It&#8217;s a market research company, like a global company, and did sales from them. I jumped from customer service/sales support to doing inside sales, sales on the phone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then the biggest opportunity of my professional career up until that point happened, which was they had an opening for international sales, like outside sales. I was doing inside sales on the phone for like three months, and then it happened that they had an opening for their Latin American sales rep. Turns out it&#8217;s really hard to hire people who speak Portuguese, and Brazil was their biggest market. Although I had no experience in sales really, other than the three months that I had been doing their inside sales, they were like, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll give you a shot.&#8221; My job then went from being on the phone and just like repeating scripts to flying between Chicago and Sao Paulo once a month to meet with director of innovation and marketing of like Pepsi Co, which was nuts. I was completely unprepared. I studied business, but it was a liberal arts school. It didn&#8217;t matter. My senior year I was taking—What was I taking? Yeah. I was taking women&#8217;s literature in Afghanistan. Those were the level of classes I was taking, which was awesome. It was great, but I was not prepared for what I was jumping into.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It worked out that I was a quick learner and did that for like three, four years, which helped me put together an application, a portfolio, enough of a career portfolio to apply to Northwestern to get my MBA at Kellogg. Surprisingly they took me, even with my poor GPA, although I had some stories to tell of overcoming some challenges and getting to where I was and having a cool job, the international business, that&#8217;s always something that they look for. I had to be one of those guys that wrote an extra essay and was like, &#8220;Hey. My GPA really sucks. Here&#8217;s why. I was new to the country and whatever.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They let me in, and it was the coolest thing. It was like going to college again for me, because—or actually going to college for the first time, because those first four years in America I didn&#8217;t really feel part of America. I was an expat and there was no really context or knowledge of what college was supposed to be. It was a lot about learning and just kind of getting through, meeting amazing people, but where as I go to Kellogg, I knew what the experience was supposed to be. I had been in America for almost ten years. It had been nine years when I started. It was 2011. I was much more comfortable with my environment and what I was doing, what I wanted to do. I kind of had a vision, as opposed to I just want to make it in this new country. It was an amazing two years. It was awesome. It prepared me for what I&#8217;m doing now.</span></p>\n<p><b>How did you first get interested in tech, or were you even interested in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. I was always kind of techy. Even in the early mid-90s I was one of the first kids in my block to be online, and BBSs, and kind of testing it out. Ever since I was just kind of into it. Obviously I wasn&#8217;t a programmer or not a computer engineer or anything like that, but it was something I was excited about. I always spent a ton of money on it, so I figured I might as well get paid by them. When I went to business school I was like, &#8220;Well, I definitely want to get out of sales and do some more strategic work and do more marketing, although I&#8217;m still interested in revenue, so much so that I am in the revenue organization on Twitter. I&#8217;m not like closing the sales, because I didn&#8217;t want to live with a quota over my head anymore, although that was an incredible experience, and it prepared me to do everything that I did ever since, but I knew that I didn&#8217;t want to do that anymore. I knew when I went to business school, I said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to go to business school. I&#8217;m going to switch careers. I&#8217;m going to switch from sales to marketing, and I&#8217;m going to switch from services to tech.&#8221; That was kind of the idea.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I interned at Dell in Austin, tested Austin out. I also knew that I kind of wanted to get out of Chicago. I love Chicago, but I knew that if I didn&#8217;t get out then, I would stay there forever, which would have been fine, because I love Chicago, but it was a time to like, &#8220;I want to test something out and go to a new city.&#8221; I was really looking at Austin, Seattle, and SF. Went to Austin for a summer, and it was great, but I like to say there was a little bit too much Texas around it, so I knew that it wasn&#8217;t quite my scene. I decided to come to SF and CISCO was good enough to give me a job. Packed up and moved one more time across the country, from D.C. to Chicago, and then out to SF, and worked for CISCO for a couple years. Then today was just my one year anniversary at Twitter.</span></p>\n<p><strong>What were your first impressions of Silicon Valley, and what did you expect, and did it or did it not meet those expectations?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. It was definitely—I had two experiences. I had one that was landing at SF, and living in the city, and meeting a ton of new people. I felt like it was a very easy place to meet people, just because everyone here&#8217;s a transplant essentially, or it feels that way anyway. Here I am living in a new city, single. I just want to meet people. It&#8217;s going to be great. I was lucky also that after graduating from Kellogg eleven percent of my class moved to Silicon Valley. Not only was it easy to meet new people, but I was coming with a built in group of friends. It was a really active period the first six months. It was awesome. We were going out, like going to places and then walking out I was like, &#8220;Why would I ever do that again? That was a nightmare.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then next week I&#8217;d find myself there. It&#8217;s a weird place. It was an incredible six months. It was really fun, but at the same time I&#8217;m working for CISCO. It is an incredible company, but I would argue it&#8217;s not a very fast paced company, not anymore anyway, at least not the part of the business I was in. You felt like, &#8220;I come to the SF and I wanted to be on the forefront of tech. I want to be testing things. I want to be doing things really quickly and testing things, and trying them out, and launching, having impact. Then learning from them and then trying new things. CISCO really wasn&#8217;t set up that way at all. That was kind of a challenge. It was a great job. It paid great, and I worked with very smart people, but I wasn&#8217;t quite fulfilled professionally in the way that I wanted. That was kind of hard. That didn&#8217;t meet my expectations obviously, because I moved here, expected to be in the middle of it. After a year and a half I was like, &#8220;This has been great. I feel like I&#8217;ve learned a lot, but I feel like the learning curve has stagnated a little bit, and I want to continue to learn, so it may be time to try something new.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><b>What are some of the things in your work that really excite you now? What are some of your favorite parts of your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love the immediacy of my work. I work on—What I try to do is I try to get—I guess the mandate of my job is to get more Twitter users to advertise on Twitter in the simplest way possible. How do we find businesses? How do we get organizations that are on Twitter and get them to spend money to advertise to reach more people on Twitter? I love the fact that we can come up with an idea today, build something in a week, and by next Monday we have a prototype out and we can kind of see, does this have legs? Does it not? We should stop, or maybe we should keep going. The fact that we can point to it and say, &#8220;I did this, and this is the result, and these are the people I worked with.&#8221; It&#8217;s really, really rewarding, and I feel like I&#8217;m surrounded by people who are much smarter than I am. I&#8217;m always learning from them, and I&#8217;m always challenged in a way that I didn&#8217;t expect and taking my initial idea and taking it to places that I would have never come up with on my own. That&#8217;s really fun. I love that part of the job.</span></p>\n<p><b>What have been some of your biggest struggles? I mean, obviously we&#8217;ve covered quite a few of them in your process to this point, but what have been kind of the tough parts of your career that you&#8217;ve had to overcome?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My career, it was certainly feeling like I&#8217;m in a dead end job. That was really hard. That was before—this was in Chicago, my first job. That was really—It was really hard. I&#8217;m generally a pretty positive person. That&#8217;s the only time my friends at the time—I&#8217;ve had multiple friends come up to me. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Dude. You&#8217;re really negative.&#8221; I say, &#8220;Ah, fuck. It&#8217;s getting to me a guess.&#8221; Although they never really told me until after I switched jobs, and then they&#8217;re like, &#8220;You&#8217;re in a much better mood these days.&#8221; Then we figured out that I had been really negative for a long time. That was really hard. It was definitely one of those things where it was really hard to get a job when I needed a visa. Not a lot of places sponsor you and so forth. I felt like I ended up taking a job that having all of the opportunity around like I normally maybe not probably wouldn&#8217;t take, but it&#8217;s something that you kind of jump in and you figure it out as you go. After a year and a half I figured out that it wasn&#8217;t for me, and I figured out a way to get out. That was hard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I haven&#8217;t been in this stuff long enough to have true dark times or real stressful times, although anytime you&#8217;re looking for a job or you&#8217;re trying to—that&#8217;s when the city gets a little bit less friendly I think, is when we get a little bit more into the career side. Everyone moves out here. It is the true gold rush. Right? Everyone moves out here. At least most people move out here. At least especially in tech to make a mark for themselves, make a name for themselves. There&#8217;s a little bit of that—It&#8217;s obviously not everyone, but you do find people who don&#8217;t really care about hurting other people&#8217;s chances or being unfair to other people in order to get ahead. Luckily I haven&#8217;t encountered too many of those situations, but it certainly comes up, certainly some of that happens.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Yeah. I&#8217;m curious to know what your personal experience has been as an immigrant working in tech or just in your career in general? You mentioned you have a challenge of identifying role models you can personally identify with and little things like that. What is that experience like?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s really—There are a couple things that I can really point to that are positive and negative. On the negative side anyway it was hard because no one in my family went to college in Brazil, but even less so in America, so I was really lucky to be surrounded by people in D.C. who really took me under their wings, and were willing to help me, and study for the SAT with me, and write recommendations for me when they really didn&#8217;t have to. I find myself very lucky to have been in the right place in the right time, but I can completely understand how it would have been really hard if maybe I did land in D.C., maybe I landed in a more conservative area or a place where there isn&#8217;t that influx of expats so often that you kind of get used to kind of the challenge of an immigrant. I was really lucky in that sense, but for a while it was hard, because I have no idea what I was doing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was lucky that there was someone there to help me. I&#8217;ve been lucky to have friends that a couple times have been older to me and introduced me to the idea of an MBA. I had no idea that was an option really.—and see how people do it. It was like, &#8220;Fuck. That sounds like fun. That sounds like it would help my career and sounds like something I would want to learn about.&#8221; Again, I think I&#8217;m very lucky to have landed in places that are welcoming, mostly welcoming, to immigrants, really just open minded. That really helped me out, but you still always kind of feel like you don&#8217;t really know what you’re doing, even a little bit more than—I feel like most people feel that way anyway. At least that&#8217;s the way I felt. Should I be applying for school? Should I be getting my MBA? Should I be trying to get this job? There&#8217;s not a lot of people around you that have gone through the same path.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;That being said, I&#8217;ve had a really, really strange experience as an immigrant because—this is weird. Hopefully it doesn&#8217;t come out the wrong way, but I&#8217;ve been able to blend in in a really strange way. I&#8217;ve been at tables, just lunch tables, and I make a comment like—We&#8217;ll be talking about minorities or whatever and—It&#8217;s always on the news and we&#8217;ll talk about something. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah. We&#8217;re all minorities here.&#8221; Then someone will look at me and is like, &#8220;Well, not everyone,&#8221; as in they assume I&#8217;m a white guy, which is a strange thing. In a lot of people&#8217;s minds, until they get to know me or know a little bit about my story, they think I&#8217;m a white, American dude called Enrique, which makes no sense in the world. When they hear I&#8217;m Brazilian a lot of people ask, &#8220;Oh. So like your parents are Brazilian?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No. I was born and raised in Brazil. I&#8217;ve had the immigrant experience.&#8221; In a sense it hasn&#8217;t &#8230;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess what I&#8217;m trying to get at is I&#8217;ve been able to kind of hide in plain sight and avoid some of the immediate sort of reactions that—It was really surprising to me that someone was born in America, but was Mexican—I had friends like that that suffered way more prejudice than I ever did, because I have lighter color skin, and I have light eyes. It was a strange sort of—I&#8217;ve always kind of struggled with that identity that I&#8217;m called white very, very often. Obviously that&#8217;s not a bad thing. It&#8217;s not a bad or a good thing. It&#8217;s whatever, but it&#8217;s certainly not my experience, or at least maybe it is, because I&#8217;m considered white when people kind of in passing treat me in any kind of way. It&#8217;s definitely not my human experience of growing up and moving to America, and figuring things out. It&#8217;s been a strange experience a couple times to be confused for a suburban white guy that happens to be called Enrique. That doesn&#8217;t quite compute. It&#8217;s been strange, but I think overwhelmingly my experience has been positive. As I said, I&#8217;m really lucky to have landed at the right places surrounded by the right people completely by chance. Yeah. I think that&#8217;s as much as I can talk about that.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Yeah. That&#8217;s interesting. I&#8217;ve interviewed a couple of girls in this project who are black, but have lighter skin and have gone through really similar experiences where people will literally say some really racist shit in front of them, and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Uh. You know I&#8217;m black right?&#8221; They just don&#8217;t even know, because they&#8217;re not black enough that it doesn&#8217;t register in their mind that this is a black person that they&#8217;re making a black joke in front of. It doesn&#8217;t register. </strong><b>That&#8217;s mind blowing.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s strange. Sometimes you pick up that fight. Sometimes you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Dude. That&#8217;s not—You probably shouldn&#8217;t be saying those things, and not because I&#8217;m Latino, it&#8217;s because that&#8217;s a racist thing to say. Nobody should say that.&#8221; Sometimes you&#8217;ll find yourself in that place—for whatever reason you&#8217;re in an environment that you don&#8217;t want to pick that fight, or you don&#8217;t want to be the person who starts a thing, and you have to kind of sit there and kind of play along. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll play along for now, but good to know that you&#8217;re not a person I probably want to trust. You&#8217;re probably not a very good person if you believe what you&#8217;re saying.&#8221; Yeah.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s a strange thing. As I said, at least in my opinion it&#8217;s come as a blessing, because I&#8217;ve been, as I said, like hiding in plain sight, and people don&#8217;t treat me very differently. I feel like although I&#8217;ve had a lot of the immigrant experience, I haven&#8217;t had the minority experience, if you can split those two, and maybe you can, maybe you can&#8217;t, but I&#8217;ve had a lot of the immigrant experience of I just don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing here, and I&#8217;m going to try to do this thing, but I have no idea how to get there, but I haven&#8217;t had the minority experience of being pulled over often or—I don&#8217;t know. That encompasses so many things, but I think you know what I&#8217;m saying.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. I think it&#8217;s a unique position to be in honestly, just based on what I&#8217;ve heard from all these interviews of like you are going to experience many, many micro-aggressions or aggressions that weren&#8217;t intended for you, but you are definitely affected by it. You know? It&#8217;s a really interesting thing where for me if someone makes a racist joke in front of me, I know it&#8217;s not for me, but it&#8217;s still like, &#8220;Dude. Don&#8217;t say that shit.&#8221; You know what I mean? I&#8217;m not even affected in the same way as—My sister&#8217;s half black, and she deals with this shit all the time, this like, &#8220;Uh. You didn&#8217;t know? I&#8217;m black.&#8221; It&#8217;s just like a funny situation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. It&#8217;s one of those things that&#8217;s just part of life. I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s certainly been an interesting—how long it&#8217;s been now? Fourteen years? Yeah, in that sense of—Yeah. When I lived in D.C., traveling through Virginia and being just different enough that people kind of look at you funny—Maybe I was still tan enough that when I came from Brazil it was still soon enough when I moved here.</span></p>\n<p><b>And it&#8217;s Virginia.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right. That&#8217;s what I mean is anytime—I&#8217;m white enough to blend in urban areas, but when you leave those areas you definitely notice that things change a little bit.</span></p>\n<p><b>Oh, yeah. Yeah. There&#8217;s definitely a—I&#8217;m from North Carolina, so there&#8217;s definitely a tighter set of requirements for being normal. I was too pale so I was weird. You know? It’s dumb.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s culture. It&#8217;s hard to generalize. There&#8217;s obviously a lot of good people, amazing people, in all places in America, but the norms change.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. For sure. What would you say are your biggest motivators? What drives you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Man. Let&#8217;s see. I want to give you an answer that&#8217;s not really lame. </span></p>\n<p><b>Well, it&#8217;s kind of a hard question. A lot of people are like, &#8220;Oh, shit. I haven&#8217;t even thought about this.&#8221;</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know. I don&#8217;t want to default to motivated by becoming a better person, whatever. I want to come up with a real answer. I&#8217;m motivated by two things. Well, I can think of two things that motivate me. One is actually the fact that I do like to learn and moving to SF I&#8217;ve been exposed to—I&#8217;ve started working with engineers and working with people who studied very different things from me, and I love learning what they know and adding those skill sets to my tool belt, if you will. I love that in the two years I&#8217;ve been here I&#8217;ve learned full programming languages. Not programming, but I know how to do <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL\" target=\"_blank\">SQL</a>. I know how to do R for analysis. I like that kind of stuff. I like to be able to point to something and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;I learned that thing. I couldn&#8217;t do that a year ago, and now I can do that.&#8221; That&#8217;s really cool. I love to be able to do that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a personal level though what motivates me a lot is the experience of my grandfather who I was named after. He&#8217;s an interesting guy, because he was born in a very poor city of the Northeast of Brazil. He didn&#8217;t go to school until like he was in his teen years. At that point he moved to Rio, like the big city if you will, and lived with his uncle, or aunt, or something like that, and tried to get into a private school, because it was an issue for—You really try to avoid public education in Brazil.—and got turned away by the principal. He took a test and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;You&#8217;re never going to make it.&#8221; In a way it was the sort of regional you see in Brazil, which sometimes you see a different kind in America as well. In Rio it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re coming from the country, and you&#8217;re never going to make it here. You took a introductory test, and you&#8217;re so far below the bar you&#8217;re never going to make it.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He went back, and he studied his ass off, and went back months later, and took the test again, and had the highest score. After that he was number one in his class his whole career, enrolled in the Navy, became a four star admiral, became a direct advisor to the first democratically elected president in Brazil in 1995. He had this stellar career. I really look at it and see how far he came and how he was able to bring his family out of poverty really in the Northeast. Maybe not poverty, but not a lot of opportunities to have kids that were able to get good educations and we&#8217;re able to have careers in Rio, and travel, and really open up the opportunities for his family. I look at that and say, &#8220;Okay. Well, because of him I was given a much better shot at having an opportunity to make a difference and to take my family from point A to point B.&#8221; I guess he did from point A to B. I guess I&#8217;m looking at point B to point C or whatever that is. That always keeps me in check and motivates me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My grandfather went through much harder things and because of his hard work I don&#8217;t have to, so what can I do with that. What can I do with the hand that I&#8217;ve been dealt. I cherish being lucky. I find myself to have been very lucky since I moved to the U.S., being around good people, landing in good places. I never turn down an opportunity for that reason, because I try to appreciate the hand I&#8217;ve been dealt. I know personally what my grandfather had to go though to kind of impact the hand I was dealt in a way. That in a personal way that motivated me a lot. I try to keep track of that and stay on top of it.</span></p>\n<p><strong>How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? What really excites you about it? What frustrates you about it? What would you like to see change?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Yeah. I mean what excited me about it is something that has excited me for a long time. This is where the innovation that will impact the next twenty, thirty, fifty years, that&#8217;s where it&#8217;s happening, whether we&#8217;re talking about self-driving cars or whether we&#8217;re talking about new ways to communicate and affect revolutions and whatever, that&#8217;s really exciting to me. The way that the world is being transformed through technology, and a lot of that happens in Silicon Valley. The same thing that excited me twenty years ago—Although I didn&#8217;t understand it as to what was happening, but I was excited about the fact that things were changing, that&#8217;s what excites me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The frustrating thing is even though we&#8217;re on the forefront and—Well, let me think about that. One of the things that frustrates me is that technology as a whole has been a driver for change within the technology world and within the business world as far as we&#8217;re—The tech companies, a lot of it is what&#8217;s driving the economy these days. Two out of the three most valuable companies in the world are tech companies. Right? We&#8217;re talking about Google. We&#8217;re talking about Apple. If you go to the top five, we have Amazon and Facebook, so we&#8217;re driving a lot of the changes.</span></p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve been able to impact policy. We&#8217;ve haven&#8217;t been able to impact culture, other than in big cities. Yeah. Mostly in big cities. We haven&#8217;t kind of been able to really become a mass appeal. Obviously it&#8217;s a slow process, but I&#8217;m frustrated by the fact that it&#8217;s been slow and the fact that—That shows itself in a lot of different ways, but I think policy has been a point of frustration for me, that there&#8217;s so much more information there and technology has tried to make efforts to make that available to people, but people still don&#8217;t have enough information to make the big decisions they have to make every day and/or every four years, or every two years, or whatever. It&#8217;s a really big challenge for people to have the right information at the right time. I think that&#8217;s frustrating that we haven&#8217;t been able to make that happen.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a personal level it is frustrating to look around and see most boards of companies, most executive teams of companies, don&#8217;t have a representation of Latinos. There&#8217;s a big focus on adding diversity, but that&#8217;s just so hard. Twitter made it public last year that thirty-five percent—Whatever. I forget the number, but it is minority is diverse and the goal for this year is to increase it by one percent. I get it that it&#8217;s hard, but Jesus, like one percent. We can do better than this. That&#8217;s definitely a frustration. I feel like we haven&#8217;t—I don&#8217;t know. It feels like we haven&#8217;t really so many times put our money where our mouth is a lot of the time. I feel like we are so worried about the little Silicon Valley world of who has the highest valuation, who sold It for the biggest amount of money, who&#8217;s the new darling of VCs? We have all this cash, all this impact, we  can make such a big difference. We choose not to, because there&#8217;s all these other competing priorities. That being said, I&#8217;ve never been in a position where I had an opportunity to be a darling of a VC or sell it for hundreds of millions of dollars, so maybe I would have made the same choices. I&#8217;ve never had that experience, but looking from the outside it is certainly something that you look at as like it just looks like a missed opportunity.</span></p>\n<p><strong>I agree. My last question for you would be what advice would you give to folks from similar backgrounds to you who are hoping to get into tech? What kind of lessons have you learned that you&#8217;d share?</strong></p>\n<p>My advice is that it can be done. It can be done. You can&#8217;t be afraid of failing. One of the things that I learned by moving to America and—Maybe that could have happened in any country, because it&#8217;s really based on—because I&#8217;m speaking a language that I don&#8217;t have command of you just fail every twenty-five seconds in the most basic level. You just speak poorly or don&#8217;t understand something that&#8217;s around you. You can react a couple different ways to that. You can either shut down and say like &#8220;I&#8217;m just going to hang out with my Brazilian friends, because it&#8217;s easy,&#8221; or you can, &#8220;You know what? Screw it. I&#8217;m going to fail a ton, but I know that I can learn from it, and I can get better.&#8221; One of the reasons why I think I went with the latter was because I knew I was leaving in two years, which ended up not happening, but I was like, &#8220;Who cares? Right? I have nothing to lose. I&#8217;m going to leave in two years anyway.&#8221; That really made an impact. It kind of really changed the way I was wired in the sense that failing was totally okay. It&#8217;s the only way you learn. It&#8217;s the only way you can try, but you have to understand that—It&#8217;s kind of like career or &#8230;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of life really is kind of like baseball. If you can hit it thirty percent of the time, you&#8217;re doing really well. I guess my biggest advice is that it can be done, but you&#8217;re not going to go one for one or even one for two. You might have to try a few different times and reach out to people, try to find people that could relate to you, or try to reach out to anybody. I feel like most people would be willing to help you. You don&#8217;t have to pull on the racial string or similar experience, although that could be helpful. I think it can be done. I think people here are more welcoming than most places in the world, because like I said, we&#8217;re all transplants. We&#8217;ve all experienced in some sort of fashion being an outsider in SF, because most people came from outside of SF. I think people are more open than in most places. That would be my advice.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Let&#8217;s start with the early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I am actually a native Californian. [chuckles] I&#8217;m from Sacramento so I didn&#8217;t go that far. My parents have lived in the same house in the suburbs since before I was born. They&#8217;re still there. </span></p>\n<p><em>My early life wasn’t bad—it was just incredibly boring. Every day was the same. We didn&#8217;t travel, we didn&#8217;t do a lot of cultural events, we didn&#8217;t have guests, we didn&#8217;t eat out. I spent a lot of time by myself daydreaming.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I knew there was something out there that was interesting – that there was an entire world of things that were interesting. My driving force was to have a life that was interesting.</span></p>\n<p><b>How did you first get interested in tech? </b></p>\n<p><em>One day my mom brought home a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TI-99/4A\" target=\"_blank\">TI-99</a> that someone had at work. I spent hours typing in the exact code from the manual. If I got everything right, it would say, &#8220;Hello Hava.&#8221; It was just so amazing to me that it would do that. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s probably the first time that I had an interest in technology just because it entertained me and allowed me to entertain myself. But really, my interest came about more in college. I wanted to be a heart surgeon, and then I entered college and I couldn&#8217;t really do that. I started chemistry and I was not good at chemistry. I tried very hard but I just couldn’t understand the lessons. I even recorded the lectures and played them back in the evenings. I talked to the professor. I had tutors but I just couldn&#8217;t grasp whatever it was, and my professor pulled me aside and said, &#8220;Hey, why are you doing this to yourself?&#8221; So I ended up majoring in history which is pretty big step from my path to being a heart surgeon.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, it definitely is.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had spent so much time dreaming about my future as a heart surgeon. I didn&#8217;t know what to do with my new major so I took some internships, I did one in law and one in history, and they were just really boring. I wanted something that was more exciting, more futuristic. I was hoping for something that would be an interesting career choice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I took a year off between my bachelor&#8217;s and my master&#8217;s. I worked at a medical billing company as a temp. My goal was to match missing checks &#8211; checks that would come in the mail &#8211; with patients. So checks that had no name or had the wrong name or had too many names. In order to do that I needed to search different databases using old style phone modems and command line interfaces. That was really cool. It was a large medical billing company, so it had maybe three different systems that they were working with. I would dial into each database and search using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix\" target=\"_blank\">Unix</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS\" target=\"_blank\">DOS</a>. I would try to find the people and match them with the information that was available on the check. It sounds pretty boring but I actually loved it. I loved every minute of it. It felt like I was in &#8211; what&#8217;s the movie? &#8211; War Games, or Sneakers, where you&#8217;re [chuckles] hacking into the systems and finding information that you shouldn&#8217;t have a hold of. It was fun! Oddly fun. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pretty quickly, when I realized how much I enjoyed that, I decided to get a master&#8217;s degree in information science, or library and information science. I even found a job that matched these new interests – I was going to be an intelligence research specialist for the FBI. [laughter]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So that is really what I wanted to do, and it&#8217;s still kind of back in the depths of my soul, what I want to do. It&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m doing. [laughter] But being an intelligence research specialist just speaks to me. And so I went to graduate school thinking that I was going to go in and learn about database research and how to find information, and then, probably one class into my degree, I found HTML. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML\" target=\"_blank\">HTML</a> fit some unmet need I had to combine creativity and logic. So once again I changed course and I started a full time web design job six months before graduating, and I stayed at that job for eight years. And I just kept learning, and taking technology classes. Learned how to code in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl\" target=\"_blank\">Perl</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript\" target=\"_blank\">JavaScript</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML\" target=\"_blank\">XML</a>, and then about eight years in, when I left, mobile technology was coming in, and that&#8217;s the most exciting thing. I mean the ability to have a computer in your pocket and have access to the world&#8217;s information is really exciting. So I started working for Motorola. I worked on mobile devices there, and then I left for Dell to work on a mobile device for a short period of time, and then I came back to Motorola for a few more years before heading over to Skype, where I am now. </span></p>\n<p><b>Walk me through some of the most exciting parts of your work—what you&#8217;re proud to work on, what activates you.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think what activates me is dreaming of the future. Well, connecting people is pretty amazing. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s kept me at Skype, the idea that people are being able to talk to each other in situations where they normally wouldn&#8217;t be able to. That people can use Skype when they&#8217;re apart. People who are in relationships actually use it to sleep together and have an arrangement where they turn it on, and they feel like they&#8217;re together even though they&#8217;re not together. That&#8217;s pretty exciting for me. Of the projects I&#8217;ve worked on, sadly, the first three years at Skype were all secret projects that never made it out. And they were amazing. [chuckles] We&#8217;re seeing some of them appear in Facebook and other places now, but they never made the light of day here just because organizational changes and people switching around. What I&#8217;ve actually done that&#8217;s been released is less exciting. [laughter] </span></p>\n<p><b>I think the exciting thing about being in tech is that you&#8217;re a part of the future and you get to know things first. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You pay attention and you find&#8211; self-driving cars, that&#8217;s just amazing. I love the idea of a home that&#8217;s connected. I don&#8217;t work on any of these things. [laughter] At the point in which self-driving cars become a reality, I can just have a car that, it knows that I go to work every day at the same time, so it can drive up and pick me up or take my kids to school. The idea that I don&#8217;t have to own a car anymore, that I don&#8217;t have to take care of something anymore, that it&#8217;s safer and more functional and it knows what radio station or what music I like when I get in. Just all of this that this smart technology is what thrills me. I mean the <a href=\"https://nest.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nest</a> is pretty cool, that it controls your home, but there&#8217;s so much more. The lights, everything we do could in theory be controlled through technology and make our lives easier, which excites me.</span></p>\n<p><b>What have been some of the toughest parts about working in tech for you, some of the biggest struggles and roadblocks?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think just being a woman in tech—there aren&#8217;t that many of us, which is a little bit of a struggle in its own. </span>I<em> applaud Sheryl Sandberg for empowering women but I think that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_In\" target=\"_blank\">Lean In</a> fails in certain aspects, such as espousing the belief that women can have it all, which I&#8217;m sure makes some women feel like complete failures when it doesn&#8217;t work out.</em><em> I’m a fairly affluent, well educated, well connected woman with extended family and a stay at home husband and it is challenging to be a parent and to work. I’m incredibly lucky and I’m still exhausted by it – every day. Just imagine all the women who are less lucky, who have less help and work longer hours for less money. How must they feel?</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I bet they don’t even consider their role as a woman in the work force, they’re just doing what they have to do to get through the day and keep their families running. </span><em>Yes, women can have it all, but let’s be honest, women can’t have it all at the same time. At least not without the support of family or a well paid group of nannies which most women can&#8217;t afford. I think women often spread themselves too thin with the expectation that they can do everything or they should be doing everything. I see it all the time. I do it all the time. </em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a parent, especially a mother in tech is all about prioritization, if you’re on top of the things you&#8217;ve prioritized where you spend time and how you spend time becomes a choice. That&#8217;s something that I feel has been easier as I&#8217;ve gotten older. Mothers are experts at multitasking, but they also have to know when to turn that off and focus. That&#8217;s a challenge that earlier in my career I wasn’t able to figure out quite as well. </span>Would I like a larger role? Sure, I would honestly love to do something more &#8211; and I know that I can do something more but I think that that next level in my career means that I need to spend more time away from my family. I love to travel but my kids need me and, even better, want me to be around. For now, it is important for me to be home in time for dinner and homework. When they no longer need me, I&#8217;m sure I’ll spend less time focusing on them and more time focusing on my career. But it is a challenge that &#8211; for whatever reason &#8211; I don&#8217;t think men feel quite as much.</em></p>\n<p><b>You&#8217;ve had a particularly unique experience as a mother, having a child with a serious medical condition. You mentioned at one point in your life you were cooking everything from scratch to keep your child alive. Tell me more about that experience, of providing full-time care for a sick child while having a full-time career.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, we’ve had a raw deal these past couple of years since his diagnosis and, after all the suffering and all the medications and all the hospitalizations, we discovered that the key to keeping him stable and healthy is making sure he stays on something called the <a href=\"http://www.breakingtheviciouscycle.info/\" target=\"_blank\">Specific Carbohydrate Diet</a>. For me this means I&#8217;m home in the evening and cook everything he consumes from scratch starting with raw ingredients. We can’t eat out. We can’t buy prepared food from the store. I spend at least an hour or two a day on weekdays cooking and much more than that on weekends. The challenge is making food so good that he wants to eat this way and doesn’t feel that he is missing out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learning how to cook and finding something that keeps him healthy has been empowering. The diet gave me control over this awful situation. And, as a result, cooking has become another interest and passion of mine, as well as trying to understand nutrition. I desperately want to understand why this diet works when everything else failed and I want to help other parents give it a try even though it is hard. Kids in America don&#8217;t naturally want to eat healthy foods [chuckles]. No ten-year-old says, &#8220;Oh, give me that eggplant, I&#8217;d really love to have that eggplant tonight, or some broccoli on the side.&#8221; But, there are ways to make vegetables appetizing and compelling. I spend a lot of time making vegetables and nuts compelling so that he doesn&#8217;t feel let down. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But </span><em>having a sick child has also helped me gain perspective on what is and what isn&#8217;t important and the confidence to speak up when faced with the ridiculous. I’m certain that confidence has made me a better employee. My child is in the hospital being fed through his arm while getting a blood transfusion, and you&#8217;ve scheduled an emergency meeting to change a color that already went through three levels of approval so you can assert control. Really?</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> [chuckles] Those discussions have taken on a new dynamic for me. I’ve never had a high tolerance politics but in the past I probably wouldn&#8217;t have said anything. Now it makes me a bit angry [chuckles] and more willing to fight against it. I see the bigger picture.</span></p>\n<p><b>How has what you look for in a job now changed from when you were first getting your career started?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These days the most important element of looking for a new job is fit. </span><em>I want to work with people who are excited about their work and are dedicated to what they do, but ultimately I want to work with people who are genuinely nice and fun to be with. I value authenticity much more than other things now.</em> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our small design group in Palo Alto has that. We&#8217;re about sharing and openness and nobody is territorial. We build upon each other&#8217;s work. Some companies interview you and put you into a pool of designers and pick you out when they need you but, in that model you can&#8217;t get a sense for if you are a good fit, and I think that&#8217;s really important, even more than exact skillset. Sure, the basic skills should match the role, but if there isn&#8217;t a good fit, and it isn&#8217;t a good environment, then everyone is miserable. </span><em>It is easier to teach someone how to use Sketch than it is to teach someone to play nice with others. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[chuckles]</span></p>\n<p><b>In your experience, did your life and perception in the workplace change after you had kids?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh sure. I had my first child when I was at a non-profit and, in a lot of ways that was wonderful. Everyone was very supportive about helping me balance being a new parent and getting my work done. It was a different experience with my second child. I had him when I was working at a large corporation and no one really cared that I had just had a baby. I had to remain competitive while pumping five times a day. I had frequent manager changes so it was hard to build enough trust to express to a new male manager what I needed without sounding like I expected special treatment. </span></p>\n<p><b>Have you had mentors or people that you looked up to for inspiration, or even people that were pivotal in changing your career along the way?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have had people that I admire. Not so much, a mentor. I would love to have had a mentor. When I first started at Skype, we had the best leadership team at Skype. That&#8217;s why I came here. I had worked with them at Motorola. We called them the golden triad. These three men were great designers and amazing leaders but they were also genuinely nice people and easy to work with. </span><em>The head of design was famous for asking people in an interview, &#8220;Are you nice?&#8221; It was really interesting that people would get tripped up on this, thinking that he would want them to answer, &#8220;No I&#8217;m not that nice. I won&#8217;t let people push me around.&#8221; But he genuinely meant, &#8220;Are you nice? Can you work with others?&#8221; He hired the nicest people. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve all stayed because, even though he is gone, he created an environment that persists.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We come in every day and enjoy each others company. That&#8217;s what makes work fun, and it should be fun. Even if the project isn&#8217;t fun, work can be fun.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are your biggest motivators? What drives your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I want to design a product that people think is amazing, that they want to use and that they choose over other similar products because they like it so much. Or, better yet, design a product that doesn’t currently exist that changes the way people live and work for the better. That’s the ultimate goal. </span></p>\n<p><b>How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? What is really exciting to you? What is frustrating to you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What&#8217;s exciting for me is to see technology come together. Car interfaces, mobile phones and tablets, TVs and smart home systems… medical technology. There&#8217;s this AI layer that&#8217;s potentially scary, yes, but, when they work together and share data, there&#8217;s so much potential to create something amazing. I feel like we&#8217;re almost there, that if we can get these things to work together smartly, technology will make another leap forward. We haven&#8217;t quite reached that yet. There are a lot of one hit wonders out there. Little tiny tech places that are doing pieces that are really valuable, but they aren&#8217;t able to integrate into a larger system because they aren’t Google or Microsoft. Medical technology feels like that&#8217;s the next big boom. Doctors need to be able to have the tools to work smarter. </span></p>\n<p><b>What would you like to see change, either technologically or culturally?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was in a diversity class last week at Microsoft run by this amazing company in New York. They had improvisers &#8211; actors &#8211; that would play the roles of different people in a company setting.  The actors kept to a script throughout the class to show us the challenges that their character would experience in different situations. There were hundreds of people in the class from Microsoft but only two African Americans in the room, one was leading the session and the other was an actor. The leader pointed out that there was not a single African American in the audience. Not a single one. There were a handful of women. That needs to change. That&#8217;s frustrating. I think that is a big problem. </span><em>I mean it&#8217;s wonderful that the women&#8217;s bathroom is always empty, but it&#8217;s a little bit sad too.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It&#8217;s sad that a lot of women leave because they&#8217;re frustrated. I’ve never been a man but I would bet that being a woman or any minority in high tech is far more challenging than being a white man. </span><em>So much energy is spent on trying to behave in a certain way that doesn’t feel natural. I want to fit in. I want to get ahead but it’s draining and I only have so much energy to spend.</em></p>\n<p><b>Historically has your support network been your family or have you been able to find support networks at all in the industry or in your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think my friends are my support network. By friends, I mean, the people that I have worked with. We have actually quite a bit of diversity in our little group.  I have been lucky enough to work with some of the same people at multiple companies. We find each other and we work together again because we have found something that works, and I think there&#8217;s a lot of value in that. I don&#8217;t feel that you can get a better situation than when you find two people who have the same work ethic, who have the same goals, similar attitudes and they work really well together because you can build something so fast. For example, the pairing of an interaction designer and a visual designer that work really well together. I don&#8217;t have to spend time explaining what I mean to my partner because he just understands. We work so well together that we don&#8217;t need to physically be together anymore. I can send him a file and, with little explanation, he&#8217;ll know exactly what I want changed. I don&#8217;t have to write it all down, and he&#8217;ll change it and send it back to me or vice versa. And I know exactly what he hasn&#8217;t finished and what pieces he&#8217;s looking for me to fix. It&#8217;s a really great pairing when you have it, and that&#8217;s the ideal situation that companies should be looking for, honestly. It&#8217;s a pairing and not necessarily an individual. </span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in five or ten years? Do you think you&#8217;ll still be in the tech world?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure. I hope to eventually branch out to something slightly different. Just something with a little bit of newness for me &#8211; medical technology or smart homes or self driving cars &#8211; something that&#8217;s tech driven but that I would still need to learn. I aspire to have a larger role. That would good for me. I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m quite ready emotionally, but I&#8217;m getting there. [laughter] As long as I’m not the person who makes executive power point decks attractive, I’ll be fine. [laughter] We’ve all been there. I think that’s the worst thing you can do to a product designer, put them in charge of powerpoint deck attractiveness.</span></p>\n<p><b>How would you like to see tech be more accommodating to women over time in their career and retain them, especially as they start growing families?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think companies just have to hire more women, honestly. I don&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s one thing that a company can do to make it better, except to have more women around who understand the situation we’re in. My colleague just had a baby and she&#8217;s having struggles so she&#8217;s taking time off and working from home and everyone&#8217;s been very accommodating but I am sure she doesn&#8217;t feel as good as if say 50 percent of the people that she worked with really understood what she is going through. She shouldn&#8217;t have to feel guilty for that. </span><em>I don&#8217;t feel like any policies are going to change that unless the policy is just to hire more women, period. Find them, hire them, reward them for being individuals and not for behaving like men. Promote them because they make an impact even if it isn’t the same type of impact you’ve been measuring against and, for crying out loud, find out how to keep them. </em></p>\n<p><b>My last question for you would be, what advice would you give to folks from similar backgrounds or similar life experiences, who are hoping to get into tech or stay in tech full-time? What do you wish you had known in the beginning?</b></p>\n<p><em>I wish that I had learned to be more assertive early on. I am learning to be more assertive and direct, because that&#8217;s what&#8217;s expected when you&#8217;re in a male dominated environment.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I don&#8217;t normally talk [laughter] very much. Here I&#8217;m talking, but I&#8217;m not the talker. I sit in the meeting and I listen and synthesize the information, and then when I have something valuable to contribute I&#8217;ll contribute that, but I don&#8217;t just talk for the sake of talking. I&#8217;ve noticed that talking for the sake of talking works really well for men. [laughter] Learn how to talk, even when you have nothing valuable to say [laughter]. </span><em>Speaking up when you do have something to add is absolutely necessary. Knowing how and when to interject is important. Feel empowered to say something even when you&#8217;re the lowest ranking person in the room so that somebody notices you.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It seems like the number one most important thing, is just speaking up.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

I was four when my family moved to Chicago. My dad picked me up at O’Hare airport in an avocado green, four door, Torino. I wish I still had that car. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a rather funny story actually. So funny that I had to go back and ask my parents if it was true. When we moved, my dad had already been in Chicago for about six months or so, getting Visas for everyone.  He went back to Mexico to pick us up, and when we were at the airport, the agent said &#8220;where&#8217;s the Visa for the baby?&#8221; (me), and my dad said &#8220;Oh he doesn&#8217;t need one. He&#8217;s a baby.&#8221;  And the agent said &#8220;Yes. He needs a visa and a passport.&#8221;  And so my dad turned to my mom and asked her if it was ok if he gave him to a Coyote (the people who cross people over the U.S. border illegally). To which my mom promptly said “Um, no. You are taking him back to your mom’s house”.  So, if it was up to my dad, he would have handed me over to someone that would have probably stuffed me into the trunk of a car. Thankfully that did not happen.</span></p>\n<p><b>Wow.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was the beginning of my story in the States. Eventually I got over. After that, we lived in a Mexican neighborhood in Chicago, and for the most part, I was encouraged to go to school. College, if you made it, was okay. If not, it was fine, too. The important thing was that you were able to get a job. So</span><em> it wasn&#8217;t as if we were badgered with &#8220;become a lawyer, become a doctor.&#8221; That was definitely not where I came from.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I discovered art and design my own. I was always interested in the arts in some form. Without question I sort of fell into design. I loved it. I did it well naturally and that&#8217;s why I felt at home. </span><em>Focusing on design was a little unusual because in Mexican culture the arts aren&#8217;t necessarily celebrated. My parents still don&#8217;t know what I do. They have no reference point. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At least when I was working with Motorola they could reference cell phones, but now it’s a little more difficult for them to visualize what I do. It&#8217;s a little difficult to speak to them about it. I&#8217;ve never had a conversation where I&#8217;ve vented about work and have them understand what I was going through.</span></p>\n<p>I do remember telling my mom that I was going to go to an art school, and I think I remember her saying, &#8220;How are you going to get a job?&#8221; It didn&#8217;t come together for them, and frankly, for me, either.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While growing up, I was very close to two of my cousins, we’re around the same age, we spent a lot of time together. A couple of years back, I asked my mom &#8220;What happened to my cousins, what are they up to?” She&#8217;s said, &#8220;They&#8217;re just working.&#8221; I asked her what they did and she told me that they&#8217;re working construction. For some reason that made me a little sad. I don&#8217;t know why. It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m judging them. It&#8217;s not that at all. That&#8217;s what my parents, and my uncles did after we moved to the U.S. They worked construction. In my mind though, I felt as if my cousins stopped trying. Because they chose to do what our parents did. In a way, I thought, what good was it that they sacrificed the life that they had in Mexico to move here, and then for my cousins stop that growth. To not go beyond anything that they already knew? I still don&#8217;t know how I feel about that. I just hope that that’s what they wanted. For me, I&#8217;ve always wanted more. Not necessarily material things, but to learn, and grow beyond my surrounding environment. In a way, it felt like they chose to stop learning. Which was something I am not willing to do.</span></p>\n<p><b>Do you feel like that was a primary motivator from you from the start—going beyond or creating something to justify what your parents sacrificed?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, I think so. Just watching them work. Both my parents worked so hard, and to think that it was for nothing, which is what it would have felt like for me, if I chose a factory job. That was definitely a motivator for me.</span></p>\n<p><b>Walk me through the process of finding design, and then how you got here from Chicago, and into tech.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In high school I did a lot of work with the Boys and Girls Clubs, and during the summer I took part in a mentorship program. We toured an advertising agency once, I think it was Leo Burnett. Once I saw the office, I thought, &#8220;Wow, this is incredible.&#8221; I had never thought about anything like that before. I saw all of the brands that I knew, and I was standing in the place that they were created. That was amazing to me. It was through advertising, even though I didn&#8217;t go into advertising, that I discovered design. That was a motivation to me &#8211; to see that these were someone&#8217;s ideas. I wanted to do that. I wanted to&#8211; I wanted my voice to be heard in that same way. That&#8217;s when I knew that I wanted to go, in some form, into design. I think I was a junior in high school at that time. I signed up for art school the next year.</span></p>\n<p><b>Amazing. I can so relate &#8211; going back into childhood, not knowing what creative was, but I loved commercials, and that was kind of my first exposure to creative campaigns, and didn&#8217;t know it. I remember just being enthralled with them, and not knowing that that was my first exposure to communication and design, and creative stuff.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, it was beautiful. I just loved being there, I just remember being completely excited about it. And because of that excitement I continued to work with The Boys and Girls Clubs, and ended up winning an award for them, The Mid-Western Youth of the Year Award. It was a national competition that was held in Washington. We actually got to go to the White House and meet Bill Clinton in the Oval Office, which was incredible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was so exciting to be at The White House. The work that I did with the Boys and Girls clubs was hugely inspirational to me. I saw a lot of benefit in it, it helped to solidified my work ethic.</span></p>\n<p><b>When did you end up leaving Chicago?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It just kind of happened. I had never been to San Francisco, or California before vacationing here. I loved it immediately, I absolutely fell in love with the city. After my vacation, I wanted to make the move to California. Although, with me being in Chicago, I thought that I’d never be able to do it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I still remember the day when it all started. I was in a meeting with my design team in Chicago, we were on a call with the engineers here in California. They were talking about a problem that we were having that we could not solve. That’s when my manager said, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re not going to fix that until we have designers co-located with you. So until then, we have to deal with it.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s when I muted the phone and said &#8220;I&#8217;ll move there if you need me to.&#8221; And he replied with, &#8220;Don&#8217;t say that if you don&#8217;t mean it.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll mean it.&#8221;  So that&#8217;s how that happened, I just asked for it. It was a complete coincidence. I couldn&#8217;t have planned it any better, or different. It was wonderful.</span></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s amazing.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, it was a very lucky situation.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are some of the proudest moments of your career, would you say?</b></p>\n<p><em>Creating work that is seen by millions of people, all around the world. That&#8217;s pretty incredible. That is something that I’m extremely proud of.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Most days I have to remember to keep that shine from wearing off. The design and engineering process can sometimes take away from that feeling of accomplishment. In some cases, you might not feel as great about the product as you might have hoped. But it is still a fantastic feeling. You not only have to keep doing good work, but must go beyond what’s expected. </span></p>\n<p><strong>What have been your biggest troubles over the course of your career and this can be work, it can be personal.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I still struggle with commanding the English language well, that’s something that can be a barrier for me. To sit and listen to some of my colleagues sound so eloquent, and beautiful, and clear. It intimidates me a little because I feel as if I can’t do that.</span></p>\n<p><b>Interesting.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s been a barrier for me, I’ve had to break through that and form the confidence that feeds this ease of communication. </span></p>\n<p><b>And a surprise to me talking to you now, because you&#8217;re so eloquent.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If I&#8217;ve grown, it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s taken work. It wasn&#8217;t something that came easily to me. Even talking to my brothers and sisters over the phone sometimes [chuckles] I just want to scream, &#8220;Enunciate! Enunciate!&#8221; [laughter] because that&#8217;s a big part of having a successful conversation &#8211; that your message is heard, that it&#8217;s clear, and it reaches your audience, even if it&#8217;s one person. Culturally that wasn’t something that was focused on while growing up. I’ve had to develop that as an adult.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are other ways that you felt like you had to play catch up?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For me, it’s always been a bit difficult to feel that I&#8217;m part of the group. In order for someone to be part of the group, they have to be able to carry the conversation, be involved. For a couple of reasons, historically, I’ve had difficulty with this. Something that I’ve had to do to address it is take vocal training. It’s something that has helped me feel like I have an equal voice in the room, that what I have to say is of equal value. </span><em>My speech trainer once said “the deals are made on the golf course”. It rang true for me because throughout my life, I’ve felt as if I’ve kept myself from these life-changing conversations because of that discomfort.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It was a huge realization for me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The small talk and schmoozing, I’ve never been good at that when it involves work. Maybe it&#8217;s intimidation that happens. I&#8217;m not sure yet. It’s something that I have to improve. </span><em>I feel like my Caucasian, male, colleagues can just walk into a room and say, &#8220;Hey, how&#8217;s everyone?&#8221; It’s not difficult for them. For me, there&#8217;s a hesitation. I haven&#8217;t been able to quite grasp, a<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nd maneuver around that quite yet.</span></em></p>\n<p><b>In that same vein, have you felt like an outsider at times or have you specifically experienced things that made you feel different?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, but I think it&#8217;s all self-inflicted, I think, because I sincerely think that people don&#8217;t, for the most part, project these feelings towards people. Although I don&#8217;t know what makes me feel that way. Maybe it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve learned, and I&#8217;m trying to ignore, but I can&#8217;t. </span><em>At times I would feel excluded, but for me specifically, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s related to being Mexican or gay or what that might be. So yeah. I have felt excluded. For me, it is work to go and make myself part of that group. It&#8217;s almost like taking a deep breath and diving in. That takes a huge amount of energy for me, and sometimes I just don&#8217;t have that energy. It&#8217;s emotional energ<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">y.</span> It&#8217;s emotional overhead.</em></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. When I was in tech, I acted ten years older that I do now and acted less feminine, just to feel like I could hang.</b></p>\n<p><em>At work that is something that I do. I kind of like bring it down a little bit. Why? I have no idea. And it&#8217;s not a good feeling, I don&#8217;t know what that does to someone long term. Like I don&#8217;t know what that does to our creativity. It could destroy it. And being in a company this size, if you get to be creative, you&#8217;re lucky. I think that that might be one of the reasons why people leave these jobs is because they&#8217;re not themselves, both artistically and personally.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you had mentors or even people that have inspired you along the way?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up, yes. Back to the Boys and Girls Club, the director, his name was Mike. He’s the one who would drive me on Saturday’s for my mentorship program. Thinking back, that was incredible. To have someone do that for me. It’s so inspiring, to think that he drove me to these events, on his personal time. Where I would see, and experience new things, learn from them. It wasn&#8217;t beneficial for him at all. It makes me realize how important that work is. To be selfless. </span></p>\n<p><b>What are your biggest motivators? What drives you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think it continues to be&#8211; I want to be heard. I don&#8217;t want to dilute it &#8211; I was going to say that that that&#8217;s perhaps a motivation for everyone, in some way. Expressing my opinion is definitely one of my big motivators. Emotional, and artistic expression.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you feel like your background shapes the way that you approach your work? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My upbringing actually clashes with this because we were taught not to share your feelings, and express ourselves, don’t cause disruptions. We were taught to basically disappear into the background. And I&#8217;ve grown up to be the opposite of that. Not that I dress loudly or do things that are spectacular &#8211; in the theatrical sense anyway &#8211; but I think it&#8217;s been difficult for me to counter that, and develop the strength to feel comfortable with sharing my opinion.</span></p>\n<p><b>So becoming that person, how has that impacted your relationships with folks from home?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think those relationships have grown farther apart because of the things that I&#8217;ve learned. It was the reason that I left home, because I wanted to change these things within myself.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do they feel about the person that you&#8217;ve become?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My parents are proud. My mom &#8211; I talk to my mom more than my dad &#8211; I haven&#8217;t asked her [chuckles]. I don&#8217;t know, I would hope that she&#8217;s proud.</span></p>\n<p><b>I bet she is.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was so cute, she used to ask me, &#8220;Oh, how are you doing? Do you need rent money? Do you need anything?” I&#8217;m in my late thirties, she doesn&#8217;t ask me if I need rent money anymore. I think it’s her little way of letting me know that she thinks I’m ok.</span></p>\n<p><b>What do you think about the state of tech in 2016? What excites you and what frustrates you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh goodness. </span><em>I don&#8217;t like that the beauty of communication is being lost. I&#8217;ve recently gone through this life change where I&#8217;ve come to appreciate people for who they actually are, instead of who they are perceived to be. Being present, and listening, and actually being there for someone. That’s being lost, and I think that might be a casualty of tech, sadly.</em></p>\n<p><b>I would agree.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And so that makes me sad. So, I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s going to be an app to fix it or not. [laughter]</span></p>\n<p><b>I feel like there&#8217;s an awakening happening a little bit, where people are tired of being internet friends, you know?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah.</span></p>\n<p><b>Just like 10% friends, where it&#8217;s all transactional.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah.</span></p>\n<p><b>And tiny, tiny nuggets of feedback.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah.</span></p>\n<p><b>I don&#8217;t know, I think it also takes going through some hardships and to really appreciate the real, in-person support. And to actually ask for it.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes.</span></p>\n<p><b>I just hope that that changes for the better.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Me too.</span></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s the thing. I don&#8217;t know if we are experiencing that because we live in San Francisco, or if that&#8217;s the case in the rest of the world. I have no idea.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Me neither.</span></p>\n<p><b>But definitely, we&#8217;re in peak competitive lifesharing right now.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. Absolutely. I tend to “over-share” on Facebook and I&#8217;ve thought to myself, &#8220;why do I do this?&#8221; It&#8217;s&#8211; I don&#8217;t want to call it stupid, but it&#8217;s empty. So what if I was getting a donut at Mr. Holmes? [laughter]</span></p>\n<p><b>I feel you. Let&#8217;s see. What are some of the biggest lessons you&#8217;ve learned while working in tech? Again, it could be work, it could be personal.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve had colleagues who have chosen their &#8211; and this isn&#8217;t just in Tech &#8211; they chose to try to get ahead in work, and by doing so, they sacrificed their friendships at work. And that was unfortunate. And like I said, that just doesn&#8217;t happen in tech, but I think because it is such a saturated environment here. We basically all do the same thing so I&#8217;ve seen people become and get pretty cut throat just to ship their feature or whatever and that&#8217;s unfortunate. To me, that&#8217;s not what good work is. I can&#8217;t remember who said it, he basically ‘values a work ethic that doesn&#8217;t leave a trail of carnage behind you’ or something like that. I&#8217;m horrible with quotes [chuckles].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that&#8217;s how I feel. I don&#8217;t think that shipping a feature makes you successful if your life is empty, and you have no friends, and everyone hates you. I’m not going to want to work with you.</span></p>\n<p><b>A feature&#8217;s not worth that.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, it&#8217;s not.</span></p>\n<p><b>[Chuckles] You mentioned in your pre-interview the importance of being true to your history &#8211; but also learning to thrive in your environments &#8211; expand on that.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was in reference to the language barrier, but it goes beyond that. It involves everything &#8211; the way you speak &#8211; the way you dress, what you eat. </span><em>I remember bringing lunch into work one day. I was the only Mexican in the office &#8211; and while I was having lunch everyone would always ask, &#8220;What is that?”. It made me feel so self conscious, because I felt as if they were making fun of me. I never went to them and stared at their plates asking about their lunch. I felt that it was rude. Things like that affect you in the smallest ways. If you start sorting, editing, and removing these things &#8212; are you stripping away your culture?</em></p>\n<p><b>It’s a fine line between being yourself and being a “culture fit.”</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. Culture fit.</span></p>\n<p><b>It&#8217;s crazy.

And that&#8217;s important, especially when you&#8217;re in a boardroom presenting. And that&#8217;s the more practical way that I can use what I&#8217;m learning in acting classes, but I like&#8211; well the reason I&#8217;m there is because I like storytelling and being creative doing that, so that&#8217;s keeping me going.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Lastly, what advice would you give to folks from similar backgrounds to you that are hoping to get into tech?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would say, </span><em>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid of speaking”. If you find yourself in a room full of the smartest people In the world. You have an opinion, and it matters. </em></p>",

Why don&#8217;t you share with me about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s complicated… I am an American citizen. I was born in New Orleans, but we started moving around when I was two years old. In 1967, when I was 5, my dad </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2005/05/20/what-am-i-doing-here-an-american-civilian-in-vietnam/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">went as a civilian to Vietnam</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, doing international development, which means they had this strange idea that, if you “developed” Vietnam economically, they wouldn&#8217;t want to be communists and the war would be over. We can see how that worked out. Meanwhile, my mother and I lived in Bangkok. So that&#8217;s really what I remember first in my life. After two years, my dad was posted to Bangkok. My little brother was born there. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was 9, </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2014/04/19/the-boys-and-girls-book-about-divorce/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">my parents divorced</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. My brother stayed with my mother in Bangkok and I came back to the States with my dad. He eventually remarried, and he, my stepmother, and I lived in Pittsburgh, and then Connecticut. Then he started his overseas career again, and we went to Bangladesh. I had just started eighth grade, and when we got to Bangladesh, there wasn’t an American school I could go to. I did eighth grade all by myself via correspondence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a year of that, I was happy to go </span><a href=\"http://woodstock.ac.in/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Woodstock School</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (nothing to do with the concert!), an international boarding school in the Indian Himalayas. I stayed there for all of high school. By that time I had already </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2003/01/07/just-another-brick-in-the-wall/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">attended 14 different schools</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, so Woodstock provided stability and a community that saved my life in a lot of ways. Today it’s my point of reference: the people I went to school with are essentially my family. This year we&#8217;re celebrating the 35th anniversary of our graduation; a bunch of us will be meeting in India for that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I visited the US once in those years, but I&#8217;d never felt particularly at home in the US even when I lived there. It wasn&#8217;t until years later that I learned to define myself as a </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/tag/tcks/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">third culture kid</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This is what happens when you&#8217;re born in one culture and you&#8217;re raised in one or more other cultures:  you become something else entirely. I&#8217;m certainly not Indian, I&#8217;m not Thai – but </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2002/11/05/what-happens-when-youre-not-a-native-of-anywhere/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m not really American either</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Now that I live in the US again, I’m a “</span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2010/10/05/coping-strategies-for-the-hidden-immigrant/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hidden immigrant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” which has sometimes caused me problems, both personally and professionally.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I came back to the US for college in 1981. I did my first year at UC Santa Cruz, then my dad realized he couldn&#8217;t afford out of state tuition in California. I was an out-of-state student no matter where I went – we didn&#8217;t have residency [for tuition purposes] in any state. That made me feel even more alienated: I could be generically “American,” but no state would treat me as a native! And I wanted so much to fit in and feel at home in my supposed native country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I transferred to the University of Texas, which in those days was very cheap, even for out-of-state. I ended up doing a degree in Asian studies and languages, with all my tuition paid by the US government because I was studying exotic Indian languages. They hoped that I would go work for the CIA or something. [chuckles] I spent my final college year back in India on a study abroad program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had just returned from that, had been back in the US for less than a week. I was visiting a friend in Connecticut and she said: &#8220;Well, we have to go on this picnic with this Italian guy because I told him I would, and I think he likes me, but I don&#8217;t like him, at least not that way.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>I basically took one look at him and thought: &#8220;You don&#8217;t want him? I&#8217;ll take him!&#8221;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We ended up a few years later married, with a kid.</span></p>\n<p>He was doing his PhD in Mathematics at Yale, but, when you marry an Italian, it&#8217;s pretty much a given that you&#8217;re going live in Italy. And we did.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Italy is a lovely country and there&#8217;s a lot to like about it. I lived there for seventeen years – way longer than I&#8217;ve lived anywhere else in my life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, I had accidentally started a career in tech before I even knew such a thing was possible. Here’s how it happened:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I left college, I had no idea what I was going to do with myself. I had had various part-time jobs during college just to help support myself, and those always seemed to end up being around early electronic technology. It all started from the fact that I was a fast typist: I’d taken typing class in high school, and I preferred typing because </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2012/05/30/hand-writing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">my handwriting was so bad</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. So I’d get hired for anything involving a keyboard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around 1983 I took a job doing electronic typesetting, which at that time meant learning a markup language, although I didn&#8217;t know to call it that. I also did word processing on a Philips word processor. In a later job, I worked on a Wang word processing system. I simply thought of myself as a secretary who knew how to use equipment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, out of college, I ended up working as a secretary for a lobbying firm in Washington, which was just completely random. I had moved to DC because I didn&#8217;t know where else to be. It was sort of close to Enrico, whom I&#8217;d just met, and my dad had a friend near DC that I could go stay with for a while. </span></p>\n<p>This was in the days of WordPerfect, and because I was always curious and willing to learn, and I wasn’t intimidated by technology, I became the person in the office who knew how to handle WordPerfect and make it do stuff. I still didn&#8217;t think of this as being a particular skill.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then a friend of my dad&#8217;s decided that he wanted to get into being a small systems integrator. This was just at the end of the time you could still make money doing that. He wanted to offer desktop publishing as a service, along with teaching people how to do desktop publishing. This was a brand new thing then &#8211; we&#8217;re talking 1987 or ‘88. This is so long ago that Windows 1.something or 2.something was the sexy new operating system! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At that time, just knowing what a font was &#8211; was unusual. With the experience I had from my previous jobs, I figured out desktop publishing and I started A) doing it as a service and B) training other people. I was designing the courses and writing the training materials myself. I didn’t have any background in training, but people liked the courses, and they definitely learned. My approach was to have them bring in work they actually needed to get done, and apply what they were learning to something they would naturally do in their jobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My boss had also been in international development &#8211; that&#8217;s how my dad knew him &#8211; so all of his contacts were in international development organizations. So, weirdly, I ended up doing two jobs for the World Bank in Africa. I went to Cameroon with 12 boxes of equipment, installed it, and taught people how to use it. Which was really fun. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of training for that trip, I took a class in how to take apart and put back together desktop PCs. I was the only woman in the class, and all the other trainees were very surprised, like, &#8220;Oh, you actually know how to take out a motherboard?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s not that hard.” [chuckles]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I ended up giving up that job in 1989 because I married Enrico and moved to New Haven, and then I was home with a baby. So when we moved to Italy I had been out of work for over a year taking care of my daughter, and I didn&#8217;t know how to go about looking for a job in Italy.  I just did the American thing of mailing out resumés to anything that looked promising, but I didn&#8217;t hear back from anybody. I had people literally laugh at me when I walked into their offices and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m looking for work.&#8221; That is just not how it&#8217;s done in Italy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But eventually this guy called me and said, &#8220;Hey, I got your resumé a while back and you&#8217;ve got some interesting skills. I have a software company, we&#8217;re doing an OCR software. Do you think you could write a manual about it?&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve never done that before, but I could probably manage.&#8221; Having written my own training materials for the desktop publishing courses, I didn’t think a software manual could be all that hard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And so, I ended up doing this project for him and, after that was over, he said, &#8220;Well, I really like the way you work but I don&#8217;t have any more work for you right now.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;d also started to write </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2003/10/27/how-i-became-an-italian-journalist/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">articles for Italian computer magazines</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (in Italian!), so I was thinking, &#8220;Well, maybe I should try to write a book.&#8221; And about that time, Fabrizio called me back and said, &#8220;Hey, do you want to write a book?&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He was working on one of the first Windows software packages for recording CDs. This was back when CD recording was just becoming something that consumers would be able to do. The first desktop CD recorders had just been announced – before that, a CD recorder was a $100,000 piece of equipment the size of a mini-fridge, with really awful command-line driven software. Blank CDs cost $25 or $50 – screwing them up was expensive!</span></p>\n<p>Fabrizio was producing CDs as a service for other people, and he saw the need for consumer software that would be easy for anybody to use, to go with the new low-priced recorders that were coming. I’m amused to see that Easy CD, the software we created, is still available &#8211; it&#8217;s in version 12 or something now. Even at the time, almost nobody knew that it was originally an Italian product.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fabrizio was a Silicon Valley style entrepreneur, but in Italy, which is a really hard thing to be. So we wrote the book, published in 1993, called “</span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2013/01/25/20-yeas-ago-publish-yourself-on-cd-rom/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Publish Yourself on CD-ROM</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” partly as  marketing for the software. By the time we finished that, he hired me full time to do documentation, translation, marketing, and a bunch of other stuff.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a piece on my website </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2007/10/17/25-years-online-communicating-on-the-internet-since-1982/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">about how I had been communicating online since 1982</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, when I got into Compuserve. So in &#8217;93 when the book was published, we were using Compuserve to hear from people who were reading the book. Then Compuserve invited me to actually run a forum about CD recording. That was the beginning of my experience in communicating with customers and supporting a product online.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fabrizio took his company to Silicon Valley, moved all the Italian engineers here, and hired American marketing and so on. I started travelling back and forth a lot because I was working closely with the engineers. And after eighteen months, he sold it for 48 million dollars, which was a lot of money in 1995. The company that bought us was Adaptec, and I ended up working as a contractor for them for six years. They wouldn&#8217;t hire me as permanent staff because, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s weird, you&#8217;re sitting in Italy, we can&#8217;t hire you there.&#8221; But it was fine, they paid me a lot of money.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That went on through the dot com boom. By late 2000, I was making a second attempt to move my family to the Bay Area. I&#8217;d been trying for years to persuade my husband to move to the US with me so I could pursue my career. I said, &#8220;Let me get to VP level and we will never have to worry again.&#8221; Because even back then I recognized that executives are a protected class.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I felt increasingly vulnerable as a remote employee – it was a very unusual thing to be in those days, people just didn’t know or care how to work with me at a distance. Some seemed to think that I was pampered, working from Italy, and that my job was just a hobby to me. I started an </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2005/07/05/mba-collecting-my-dues-from-the-open-university/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MBA</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to try to prove that I was serious about my career!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few years after acquiring us, Adaptec spun us off again as an independent software company. I again asked my family to move to California with me while I pursued this great opportunity in a brand-new company with a big job. At first my husband agreed to try it for a year or two, “but not this year.” I was traveling back and forth like crazy between California and Italy, overseeing the launch of a new website for the new company, and starting to organize moving my husband and child to the US, trying find a place to live and a school and so on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was working 14 hours a day, and I thought that doing great work would be enough to get me recognition and advancement. I was wrong about that, and I was really bad at company politics. Someone else, who spent her time schmoozing the executives, and (as I later learned) taking credit for my work, was promoted over me – she got my job and became my boss. It was utterly disheartening. And I was coming “home” to a hotel room every night and arguing with my husband over the phone about whether he would move to the US to join me. I finally said: “I can’t fight on both fronts anymore.” I told the company I was not going to move to the US after all, and I went back to Italy with my tail between my legs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was in March 2001. I kind of saw the dot com crash coming. I certainly knew I was in a vulnerable position with the company, because the woman who had been promoted over me was threatened by me. When cuts began to happen, I would be one of the first to go. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then that July my mother-in-law got breast cancer, so I said, “Well, I cannot deal with major family stress and hating my job every day,” so I quit. My husband never got over that. From the Italian point of view, walking away from a salary – no matter how much you hate the job – makes no sense. But I’d have been laid off a few months later, so I really didn’t give up much.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After that I was decreasingly employed. For a while I got contract work from former colleagues. But Italy also entered a slump that it has never really come out of. There are just no jobs, especially not jobs in tech for a middle-aged foreign woman with opinions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By 2007 I was getting desperate, I was running out my of dot-com savings. I had put away what seemed like a lot of money to me at the time, but I hadn’t made it big on any stock or anything, it was just savings from six years of good earnings. But from 2001 I earned less and less every year, and was increasingly dependent on my husband (again), which I hated. I really don&#8217;t like being dependent on anyone. I worked for Fabrizio again in his new startup, but he was paying me exploitative wages (less that I might have earned as a supermarket cashier!), and the commute to Milan from where we now lived on Lake Como was two hours each way – it was terrible and exhausting, but I couldn’t see any alternative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2007, I got in touch with Dan Maslowski, an old friend from Adaptec days, who had ended up working at Sun Microsystems. He created a contract job for me to work on content and community at Sun. I started traveling to the US for that. It paid well, and it was exciting work, with great colleagues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the meantime, my daughter had gotten fed up with the Italian school system and had gone off to Woodstock School in India for her senior year. We knew that leaving the Italian education system probably meant that she would not be able to attend university in Italy and would have to do that in the US. She had effectively left home for good, which is very unusual for an 18-year-old Italian.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And all of a sudden, it was like somebody had flipped a switch in my head. I just woke up one day in Italy and thought: &#8220;What am I doing here? I&#8217;m not happy.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In March of 2008, Sun Microsystems offered me a “permanent” job, but they said, &#8220;We can&#8217;t hire you in Italy, so pick a US office.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t even ask my husband that time. I just said, &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m going.&#8221; I came back to the US, to Colorado initially. I figured I would eventually end up in the Bay Area because this is where everything is happening, but I didn&#8217;t want to deal right away with the expense and traffic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost immediately after I moved to the US, acquisition rumors started about Sun. A couple of months later, we knew we were going to be acquired by Oracle, and everything was frozen: no promotions, no transfers. There went my chance to be transferred to California. If I&#8217;d done that with Sun, I would have gotten a cost of living raise and everything would have been easier, but now I was stuck in Colorado long past when I was ready to leave there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My job was working with the OpenSolaris community. I was still doing a lot of content &#8212; some writing, blog management, and I had started to do a lot of </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2013/04/11/technical-videos/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">video</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I had very strong ideas about using video. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the acquisition was completed, Oracle said: &#8220;You people who work on community, we don’t do community that way, so now you&#8217;re in marketing.&#8221; And the marketing director was like, &#8220;Well, your little </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDGRFR2ljLFWk3jnf83-Thg?view_as=public\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">videos</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are nice, but go write white papers.&#8221; I had been saying for years that white papers were just not popular anymore. And then the first white paper I wrote pissed off a VP, which in retrospect is amusing – I need to have words with him about that, now that we have both moved on to other things.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I could go on for hours about the Oracle acquisition (I’ve </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2012/07/01/resistance-is-futile-the-oracle-acquisition/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">written about it</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), but basically it was not a good place to be. By summer of 2010 I was looking for a new job but I was also very sick with sinus infections. After two sinus surgeries and some medical leave, I quit Oracle the Monday after Thanksgiving.  And as it turned out, my boss&#8217; boss – that same marketing director &#8212; quit the same day. I was trying to message my boss that morning. I&#8217;m IM&#8217;ing saying “I need to talk to you, I need to talk to you.” She&#8217;s like, “Yes, I know, but Dan just quit.” I ended up driving down to Santa Clara to be in a meeting at which Dan’s resignation was announced, and eventually mine, and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> boss actually spoke to me &#8212; for the first time ever &#8212; to thank me for my work. And I was thinking, “Gee, if you’d ever bothered to say a kind word to me before, I might have felt differently about this job.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So then I started at Joyent, which had been one of the pioneering cloud computing companies. I followed some Sun engineering friends into it, and I was hired by one of the founders, Jason Hoffman. I ended up working there for 4 years, in a bunch of different roles, as is typical for startups and small companies. I was the Director of Training, and then I was the Community Architect for the new SmartOS open source community, and then they gave training back to me again as well – and I turned that into a money-making business for the company. Things were starting to look really interesting and good there. In 2013 I was reporting directly to Jason, the cofounder and CTO &#8212; and then he left the company. And, you know, when your executive ally leaves, all his projects tend to get canned, so I was, all of a sudden, in a very bad position. And that&#8217;s another whole realm of stories, but basically it was clear that I should move on as quickly as I could. In the event, it took a while.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the things I would mention, if people were asking me for career advice, is the need for a sponsor. I&#8217;ve never really had a mentor in my life but Jason stepped up for me as a sponsor and he got me into Ericsson. And apparently he really had to fight for me because I was being seen as a training person, and some of the Ericsson people who were supposed to make this decision were saying, &#8220;Well we don&#8217;t need any more training people.&#8221; But, I later heard, he really argued for me and got me the job, and even got me a hefty raise. Since then I&#8217;ve proved myself and my value to the company, but that first step really took some effort on his part. And I’ll always be grateful for that.</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m so curious to hear what it was like pioneering some of those earliest concepts of community.</b></p>\n<p>When I started, nobody knew to call it “community.” On the Internet Archive you can find the website I did for Roxio, the spin-off company, when it launched in 2001. I actually use the term “community” there to refer to our users – I was surprised to be reminded of that, years later.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was a pioneer, but I didn’t realize it at the time – it all seemed to happen organically. First I was on the CompuServe forums, answering questions and interacting with people. An interesting side note is I did get harassed there, but only once [laughter]. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then people started saying, &#8220;You should be checking out the Usenet because people are talking about your products there.&#8221; I wasn’t even sure what it was, but I needed to be wherever people were talking about us, so I went and learned about the Usenet. It used to be possible to search all those old Usenet groups on Google, and you could find my name there going back many years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, some of the most prominent posts were from this serial harasser who tried to bug me for years, calling me a liar and so on (none of which was true). In those days ISPs had terms of service that you weren&#8217;t allowed to use their services to harass people.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I never did or said anything to the guy, but other people in the groups would get pissed off at the way he treated me and report him to his ISP. He kept getting thrown off his ISPs [laughter]. Which of course made him madder and he blamed me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2005/03/04/representing-a-company-in-public-internet-forums/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had started interacting with people on the Usenet</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and then some people said, &#8216;We don&#8217;t like dealing with the atmosphere of the Usenet [which was starting to become toxic with trolls], so why don&#8217;t you start a mailing list?&#8221;  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I started a </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2001/08/16/discussion-list-early-experiences-in-online-customer-communications/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">discussion list</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for users of our software. I moderated it only to the extent necessary to keep people polite to each other. I didn&#8217;t care if they said negative things about the product or the company &#8211; I mean, I cared, but I allowed it, and tried to answer criticism rather than pretend it didn&#8217;t exist. If anything, the other users would have liked heavier moderation than I was doing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So that was our foundational community, and people cared a lot about it as a community as well as a source of information about CD recording. At some point the company needed beta testers, so I chose the 10 or 12 most active and useful members of the discussion list to be beta testers. It was a very varied little elite group – we had everything from a literal rocket scientist to a pioneer in audio technology to a monk who lived next door to the Vatican – but was also a huge Star Trek fan and had been a DJ! [I was the only woman in it, come to think of it &#8211; and I created that group!]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people said, &#8220;Well, this discussion list is too active – I can’t handle this much email. Can we just have something in a newsletter form?&#8221; So I started </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2001/07/23/how-to-write-a-product-newsletter-that-will-get-raves/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">newsletters</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well. By the time I left the company, we had something like 160,000 subscribers. If I can get those numbers in my current job [chuckles], I’ll be doing really well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I really enjoyed interacting with people &#8211; and to me everybody had an interesting story. Like what you said earlier, I just find people fascinating. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The marketing side of the company and the CEO wanted to market to the cool, hip crowd. To get photos to use on the new website, they went out in the street in San Francisco and hired six random attractive young people to be the faces of our website. I kept saying, &#8220;Yeah, but the customers who are actually buying our software, as opposed to pirating it, are grandmas who want to burn photos of their grandkids onto CD to save them.&#8221; The CEO did not want to hear that. But, sure enough, the first email I ever got to the webmaster at Roxio address was somebody saying, &#8220;Your site is very appealing and looks great, but I&#8217;m a 65-year-old grandma. What do you have for me [chuckles]?&#8221; Damn it. I knew it [chuckles]. I solved that by interviewing active community members [of all ages] and featuring them on the site – that’s where I explicitly identified them as members of a community. It may have been a first for a company website.</span></p>\n<p><b>Over the course of your career what has been the most exciting parts of your work for you? What really activates you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In much of my career I have worked remotely, without much day-to-day interaction with my peers. But I was always part of a team, and that’s what I really enjoy: not just doing cool stuff, but doing it together with great people. During the dot com boom I had the opportunity to build and run a team, then really haven’t had that again until now. And I’m loving it. I really enjoy finding the right people, putting them together, smoothing the path for us all to get things done together. Managing people is hard work, but I’m finding it very rewarding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I&#8217;m doing for Ericsson now seems to be pulling together of lot different threads in my life. Next Monday [Feb 22nd] we&#8217;re about to launch </span><a href=\"http://www.ericsson.com/hyperscale\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a new website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8212; I’m the project lead on this. Part of what I bring to the project is knowing enough about the technical content (cloud) to be able to say something useful as a managing editor. But I also bring knowing how websites work, the basics of SEO, and all of the other components to go into making a big site work. All the experience I’ve gained over the years is coming together.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s also an opportunity to apply the philosophies I’ve developed over years of communicating with people online – things that were radical when I started doing them, like </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2001/12/09/online-marketing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sounding human instead of corporate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and being aware that what happens online is a conversation, not a broadcast. It&#8217;s interesting to finally get a chance to bring all that to fruition.</span></p>\n<p><b>What have been some of your biggest struggles throughout your time in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was young I didn&#8217;t realize this stuff was happening to me. Keep in mind that I started my working life as a secretary at a K Street lobbying firm in Washington in 1986 &#8211; in those days an executive would pat you on the ass and no one thought anything of it! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now when I look back on things, I go, &#8220;Holy shit! That was pretty damn sexist.&#8221; I was just young and naive and I also do have my share of geeky obliviousness, so there are things I just don&#8217;t notice or don&#8217;t think about. I never consciously tried to &#8220;be one of the boys,&#8221; but I have a salty sense of humor. I don&#8217;t mind dirty jokes, so that kind of thing never bothered me and I never thought of it as sexist (maybe sometimes I should have). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most egregious sexism I ever experienced (I’ve written a long </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2014/04/26/the-taming-of-mr-a-2/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">piece about this</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on my website) was when my Italian boss, Fabrizio, moved his startup to Silicon Valley. He took all the engineers (who were men) with him, so what was left of the company in Milan was mostly women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fabrizio felt like he had to leave someone in charge in Milan. And he went and chose the sales guy because he was the only guy left, which was just a joke. He was a good salesman, but he literally had only a fifth grade education and was just not very smart or experienced in anything except sales. Not surprisingly, he didn&#8217;t do well at managing the company. Fabrizio then hired a consultant to buck him up and make a man of him. That man was the most flaming, overt chauvinist I have ever met. The story on my blog is actually pretty funny because we ran rings around him, but all that happened because Fabrizio would not trust any of us women to run the company. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, stuff like that happened. I did notice early on that I&#8217;d go to conferences where I was essentially the booth babe, and people would be astonished that I actually knew anything&#8230;the kind of stuff that happens to most women in tech, and </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2015/03/21/twenty-years-of-being-a-woman-at-tech-events/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has been happening for a long time</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><b>You mentioned in your pre-interview that you wish you had been better at self-marketing in the beginning, because you&#8217;ve pioneered a lot of these very early concepts, and that narrative got taken away from you.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s a classic, &#8220;If I&#8217;d known then what I know now.&#8221; Because, years later, I would see people like Seth Godin talking about these things that seemed very obvious to me. It was like, &#8220;Yeah I&#8217;ve been doing that for years.&#8221;  For our new website we’re implementing an inbound marketing tool. Our boss said, &#8220;Everybody has to do the certification.&#8221; I was really resenting having to take the six hours to do it, and then was irritated by a lot of the content of the training. I realized that this  was because almost every piece of this “inbound methodology” they describe I&#8217;ve been doing for 20 years, and it may be fair to say that I invented some of these ideas. I just didn&#8217;t know what to call it at the time. (Ironically but not surprisingly, I made 95% on the certification exam.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wonder now: maybe if years ago I had had a better sense of marketing myself and my skills as a business, or had a mentor to advise me, I would have done what some of these “web gurus” were doing. There are people who&#8217;ve made a lot of money being “experts” with far less hands-on experience than I had. But &#8211; oh, well.</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m curious to know how you&#8217;ve seen tech change culturally through different tech cycles, different booms and busts.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t think it really has. A lot of the same people or same kinds of people are in power as before. As I was saying earlier, I figured out a long time ago that if you get to executive level, you&#8217;re in a protected class and you&#8217;ll never have to worry again. There&#8217;s not that many people who get there, and they mostly started out pretty privileged.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wish I could say tech culture has improved in the 30 years I’ve been working in it, but I’m not seeing it. </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2015/04/12/sex-and-tech-events/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You still get half-naked women as “entertainment” at tech conferences</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and that’s just one of the overt signs of how the industry generally thinks of women. People of color are hardly visible at all. Perhaps now there is hope for improvement because at least some people are beginning to agree that diversity is needed.</span></p>\n<p><b>What do you look for in a job now, versus when you started?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have very rarely really looked for a job, which sounds exactly opposite of the way I mean it. I mean I have rarely had the luxury of choice. My life has been buffeted along by other people&#8217;s decisions. I ended up in Italy because I married an Italian, and I was constrained by whatever I could find to do there. It wasn&#8217;t really until I decided to leave Oracle in 2010 that I had some choices. I didn&#8217;t really evaluate choices then, though, because I decided to follow my friends and went to Joyent, where I already knew people. Had I done a real job hunt then, I don’t know how it might have gone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first time in my life I&#8217;ve done interviewing in any serious way was January of 2013, when I started trying to leave Joyent. It was an interesting process, but didn’t work very well for me, I think partly because my resume is just all over the place and it&#8217;s hard to define who I am and what I do. Standard titles and job descriptions never quite fit, and many hiring managers are just not interested in someone where they have to think about “How do I fit her in?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did ask for help on that. Steve O’Grady of </span><a href=\"http://redmonk.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RedMonk</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> knew me a bit, especially since I had spoken at Monktoberfest the year before on </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2013/10/03/marketing-your-tech-talent/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marketing Your Tech Talent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I asked him for advice and he said, &#8220;Well, it seems to me that what you&#8217;re doing is developer community management.&#8221; He and his business partner, James Governor, helped me get some interviews and were very supportive. It meant a lot to know that they thought well enough of me to want to help.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But some weird things happened during that job search, a few things that made me think, &#8220;No, I don’t think I want to work for that company after all.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Like what?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At one company I had a pleasant in-person interview where they asked me &#8220;What would you need to do in the first three months of the job to build up our community?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I need to look at this information that you have about your customers and people who are already signed up,” and so on &#8212;  basically outlining how the job needed to be done.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I left with a good feeling and was waiting for a call back. A week or two later I wrote to the person who had set up the appointment, and she said, &#8220;Well, as part of the interview process, can you do all this?&#8221; &#8212; and it was basically what I had told them would be the first three months of the job! It would have been at least three weeks of solid work just to draft a project, and it wasn&#8217;t even really possible to do without access to all their internal information. Why would I do this for no pay?</span></p>\n<p>I said, &#8220;This seems like a lot to ask for as part of an interview process &#8212; this is part of the actual job.&#8221; She wrote me back and said, &#8220;Oh, well, it&#8217;s just as well you didn&#8217;t put any time into this because we found somebody else for the position.&#8221; Really? The whole thing left a very bad taste in my mouth in regards to this company.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve heard from others that this idea that people should work for free as part of the interview process seems to be a growing problem. I&#8217;ve got a friend who&#8217;s a really talented UI designer and she&#8217;s had the same thing happen, it&#8217;s like people basically asking her to do work for free, and claiming it&#8217;s part of the interview process. No. </span></p>\n<p><b>How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? Like what really excites you? What frustrates you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s always a lot that&#8217;s exciting. I love tech &#8212; I always have, that&#8217;s why I stuck so hard with it even when it would have been easier to go do something else, or at least take my technical skills to some other industry. But in tech there&#8217;s always new and exciting things happening, and I really do believe that we can solve the world&#8217;s problems by good use of technology. But I don&#8217;t think that solving the problems of the person sitting next to us at a coffee shop in San Francisco is going to help. I wish people would get out more and get more experience of the world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve heard one fairly young person speak, someone who is quite wealthy because of previous jobs he&#8217;s had (deservedly so – he’s also brilliant and kind) and can do pretty much what he likes. He gave a talk in which he seemed to be groping towards these concepts that, I realized, have always been part of my vocabulary and thought process because I grew up with my dad working in international development. I grew up thinking about how do you help people help themselves, and with the core value that we should all be trying to help others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People who have only experienced the US and the tech industry, even when their hearts are in the right place, they just may not have the experience or the vocabulary to express what they&#8217;re trying to do. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the things I like about working for Ericsson is that it’s got a very different perspective from any other company that I’ve seen. At some point I may have the chance to bring together even more threads of my life, not just my working life, but the way I was raised and things that I think are important in the context of the world.</span></p>\n<p><b>Walk me through when health became a focus in your life and how that changed everything for you.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the first time I’m going to put this out there plainly: Even before cancer, my health has rarely been great. If I had been born in Victorian times, I would have been called “sickly.” My dad was actually told this about himself as a child &#8211; the family doctor said to his mother, &#8220;He&#8217;ll never be healthy.”  I’ve had respiratory problems and sinus infections all my life, and about five years ago I was finally diagnosed as having IgA deficiency. This is a very common inherited immune deficiency &#8211; about 1 in 500 Caucasian people have it &#8211; which means that the immune defenses of your mucous membranes are weak. Lots of people with this deficiency never even know they have it. In my case, it has meant I’ve gotten respiratory infections, sinus infections, ear infections all my life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My dad probably had the same thing (and it probably contributed to his death), but it was not never diagnosed and, even when you know, there’s not anything you can really do about it. All I could do was say: &#8220;Okay, I just have to deal with the fact that I get sinus infections and what have you.&#8221; A lot of the time people don&#8217;t even know I’m sick. I just keep going. I may be feeling like absolute shit but I don&#8217;t want to let it dominate my life, so I just do stuff. I probably overdo sometimes [chuckles]. </span></p>\n<p>The IgA deficiency means that I can’t just hope that infections will go away. “Just use the neti pot” doesn’t work for me – it has to be antibiotics, sometimes over and over again. I’ve become very attuned to my body and I have a good sense of when something’s wrong.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2010, after the Oracle acquisition of Sun Microsystems, I really needed to leave that job and the stress was very unhealthy for me. I had a series of sinus infections that nothing was working on, and ended up having two sinus surgeries and </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2010/09/18/the-mother-of-all-sinus-infections/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a lot of other horrific things</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> done to me before it was finally cleared out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I should have taken medical leave at the first surgery, but my manager was confused about our status – the acquisition was so recent that I didn&#8217;t have six months as an Oracle employee, and she said, &#8220;You&#8217;re not eligible to take paid leave.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I couldn’t afford to take unpaid leave, and I was afraid I would lose my job and my health insurance, so I had to power on and pretend I was okay while I was really sick and taking an antibiotic that had horrible side effects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it came to the second surgery in October, I was that much sicker from stress and having tried to keep working. The doctor said, &#8220;Normally I would say, &#8216;Take a couple weeks and you&#8217;ll be fine.&#8217; But you are in such bad shape at this point that you need to take six weeks off.&#8221; By then I had been an Oracle employee for 8 months, so I was definitely eligible for partially paid leave. I ended up taking five weeks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After that surgery, the sinus situation was under control for a while, and now recurring sinus infections are just something I live with. But in the spring of 2014, when I was looking for a new job and the situation I was stuck in was (again) extremely stressful, I could feel that it was starting to hurt my body. I remember feeling one day like my body was burning, and thinking: “I’m going to get really sick if I don’t get out of this.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I finally got to where I was waiting for the new job to come through and I was doing this juggling act of &#8220;Well, If I resign now, then I have to pay for COBRA, how much is COBRA going to cost?&#8221; Previously, when I had been in that situation, COBRA was going to be $800 a month. &#8220;How long can I afford that?&#8221; I finally managed to work it so that I resigned, I then had the remainder of a month of coverage and was okay until the new job began. I knew that as long as I kept hanging on at the old job, it was taking its toll on me physically. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve done a little bit of research since then. As far as I can tell, there&#8217;s no evidence that stress quote-unquote “causes cancer.” There may be some evidence that being under stress can cause tumors to grow more quickly. You have to wonder, because I had a clean mammogram in April of 2014, and by the end of October I had a two and a half centimeter tumor in my breast. Something happened there. I&#8217;d been working for Ericsson since June. I had the stress of going into a new job and new situation, you&#8217;re the new kid on the block and so forth. That&#8217;s a good kind of stress, relatively, and I was happy. Maybe it was the earlier bad stress that caused it. There’s no genetic factor and little history of cancer in my family, so… just bad luck?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had started to travel a lot (which I love doing) for Ericsson. I had been to Sweden three times, then I went to Paris for the OpenStack Summit in early November and I had just had the biopsy October 31st. I was thinking, I&#8217;m doing this conference. I&#8217;m seeing a lot of people I know. I&#8217;m attending sessions, working the booth, talking to people. And all the time I&#8217;ve got these biopsy wounds that are hurting and reminding me that I&#8217;ve got something I should maybe be worried about. It was very weird, you know? Here we are in Paris and it&#8217;s so beautiful and I&#8217;m having a good time with my colleagues. An old friend came to visit me, so I had some support –  I told her what was going on. Then she had to leave the night before I did. So that final night I&#8217;m in the hotel room alone, looking out over the lights of Paris, and I finally get hold of the doctor who got the biopsy results. She goes, &#8220;Yeah, you have a little tumor,&#8221; [chuckles]. &#8220;But don&#8217;t worry. It&#8217;s small. We&#8217;ll take care of it. Here&#8217;s the name of the surgeon.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, you&#8217;re in shock when you hear something like that. I was meeting some colleagues for dinner and they were late. I&#8217;m standing outside the restaurant talking to this surgeon in California, making an appointment to get the initial pre-surgery stuff done, and it was just weird. They were still running late so I&#8217;m sitting in this restaurant. I started&#8211; &#8220;Give me something to drink, right now.&#8221; So finally these three colleagues turned up. Two of them are people I work closely with and knew well and the other one was someone completely new to me and I was like, &#8220;Hey, I have cancer!&#8221; [chuckles]. They were great about it. It was just very strange. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had scheduled my trip such that I was going back through London to visit my stepmother. I took the train from Paris to London, spent the weekend with her, then I came back to California and just started dealing with having cancer. </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2015/04/14/breast-cancer/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve written a lot about it on my blog</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The synopsis is: it&#8217;s no fun. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;d had one or two scares before. My doctors made me start mammograms at age 35 because I have very dense breast tissue. I didn&#8217;t understand this at the time, partly because I didn&#8217;t get the nuances of what the Italian doctor said to me, but now I know that having really dense breast tissue makes you more likely to get cancer. So, with all those mammograms, of course a couple of times they had said, &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s something here we don&#8217;t like, we need to do more tests.&#8221; So I&#8217;d been through scares before, and I&#8217;d always thought, “Anything but chemo. I don&#8217;t want to do chemo.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had the surgery [a </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2015/03/06/beauty-breast/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lumpectomy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">] on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving. I chose to have it then because I didn&#8217;t have plans for Thanksgiving – I could use  that time to recover. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They took out the tumor and a couple of lymph nodes, and there was no evidence of any spread. Which was the best possible news considering how big the tumor was. Then they sent the tumor off for genetic analysis and that took a few weeks. By the time the analysis finally came through, we were on vacation in Australia (I had started arranging that at the end of October, before all of this stuff started happening). When we arrived in Sydney, I was still waiting to hear the results of this test. So while driving out of Sydney airport I called the doctor, and the doctor’s assistant said, &#8220;Oh, I have the results, was about to fax them over to the oncologist and yeah, </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2015/04/19/the-verdict/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you need chemo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, we had the month in Australia, and we figured we should have as much fun as possible because the next year was going to be hell. We went to Uluru  (Ayers Rock), the big monolith in the middle of Australia. That was just amazing and magical. Went snorkeling on the Great Barrier Reef, and things like that. Had a really good time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then came back in mid-January and had to have a port put into my chest because, of the three chemo drugs they were giving me, one of them, if it gets on your skin, it burns you, so they have to administer the drug directly into a vein. The port sits under your skin and there’s a little catheter that runs into one of the big veins that goes from the heart. So that was another piece of surgery.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, I went through all of that. I&#8217;ve written a blog </span><a href=\"http://www.ericsson.com/careers/blog/career-topics/life-at-ericsson/in-sickness-and-in-health/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">post for the Ericsson Careers blog</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about this because the company was really good about it. I later learned that, in a way, they don&#8217;t have a choice. I think it&#8217;s part of the </span><a href=\"http://www.ada.gov/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Americans with Disabilities Act</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Companies that have federal contracts have to have a certain percentage of&#8211; their employees have to be people with disabilities. Just about the time I was starting to think, &#8220;Okay. I&#8217;m going to need to actually take a leave because I&#8217;m just feeling too horrible,&#8221; by coincidence, this email came around from Ericsson HR saying, &#8220;Voluntarily, please fill in this form about disabilities.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I found an article in The Wall Street Journal from the year before saying Americans are suspicious about filling out forms like this, and it&#8217;s true – because you always fear that information about a disability or health condition might be used against you. We&#8217;ve all heard horror stories about companies finding excuses to get rid of people who have health problems and so on. This article said, &#8220;Here&#8217;s why that form exists and here&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a good thing to fill it out.&#8221; Then I actually went and looked at the form, and was amused that the very first thing listed [as a disability] was cancer.  I was like, “Oh, okay, I&#8217;m officially disabled. They can&#8217;t fire me!”</span></p>\n<p><b>Wow.</b></p>\n<p>So, it was partly that they couldn&#8217;t. But also, just the way everybody [at Ericsson] was being about it, I didn&#8217;t think they would&#8217;ve anyway. It&#8217;s a different kind of company with a different kind of attitude. While I was under treatment all the stories were coming out about [a certain big company] and how awful it was to work there. There was one story from a woman who&#8217;s like, “I got pregnant, I got cancer, I got fired.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It took me a while to reach the point that I felt enough trust in the company that I thought they were going to do the right thing, and, when I did, it was a huge relief. I was definitely not at that point right away, because I&#8217;d only been with the company for a few months when I got the diagnosis. Jason [Hoffman] had gotten me hired, but he was only one person, no matter how well positioned. So, it was just a huge relief and, as other people have said since, it says a lot about the company that they did the right thing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was in chemo from the end of January until mid-June, and I only officially went on leave about a week before chemo ended, then I took off only five weeks. Because that was all I wanted to take off.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People [at work] were being very accommodating, letting me stay involved &#8212; I wanted to because I would have been incredibly depressed, bored, and lonely if I had just been sitting here at home with nothing to do. Feeling engaged and useful was so important to my mental health. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After chemo I had a month break from treatment, then radiation every weekday for six weeks. </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2015/06/26/radiation-prep-more-to-look-forward-to/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was scared about radiation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, too, because reactions are extremely unpredictable. They told me that I would probably have a worse time because I’m fair-skinned and I’d just done chemo – I could end up having blistering wounds, and this does happen, but fortunately, none of it happened to me. It was mostly just the hassle of having to drive there every day while I was still tired from the chemo. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was just about finished with that in late August, when Ericsson was participating in a big way in the IDF conference in San Francisco. All of my teammates were coming in from all over the world for it, and I went to San Francisco for that. That was my reemergence into tech society. I had actually just completed a project to amp up some of the web content around our cloud, in record time for Ericsson &#8212; while recovering from chemo while everybody else was on vacation! I had hired as a contractor an old friend from Sun to help out with this. That went so well, that&#8217;s part of the reason that we were able to do this big web project that we just launched last week [Feb 22nd]. Not only did Ericsson not fire me &#8212; they gave me more responsibilities, and that just keeps growing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was in Stockholm this January, we had a big meeting with the extended team of about 30 people and my boss showed a slide about “how are we going to organize around this big project.” And at the top was a box that said &#8220;Leadership,&#8221; and mine was one of four names in it. I almost cried, because it&#8217;s taken so damn long to be there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So that&#8217;s where we are. Trying to keep everything together and do all these big new things and hire people. I&#8217;m just drafting a series of tweets about interns I need to hire.</span></p>\n<p><b>How has that whole experience affected what you look for in a job or in your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ericsson is very different from any other company that I&#8217;ve worked for. They really invest in employees, seem to expect that you are going to be with the company for the rest of your life – the company is about the people, which is really amazing. You can do all different kinds of roles and you could possibly live in different countries. Once people get in there they tend not to want to leave. There&#8217;s a good chance I will be with Ericsson for the rest of my career. I won&#8217;t always be doing [exactly what I’m doing now]. They&#8217;ve given me opportunities and responsibilities that I&#8217;m not sure I would have gotten anywhere else.</span></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s really amazing and ties in really well to the next thing I want to talk to you about because so many folks in tech feel that their career is in danger after they hit approximately 35. Ageism is strong in tech right now. I&#8217;m curious from your perspective, in what ways has that affected you or people you know.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I became aware of ageism in tech in my first tech job. We were hiring. We brought in this guy who was maybe fifty, fifty-five, who mentioned that it was hard to get tech jobs because he was older. And I remember, even at my own young age, thinking, “That seems really stupid. He&#8217;s got experience, why wouldn&#8217;t we want him?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, ageism in tech goes back quite a ways, which is interesting and sad. All the evidence is that it&#8217;s a very real thing. I don&#8217;t know, in my own job search in 2014, how much my age was a factor. Probably it was. I only actually face-to-face interviewed with three or four companies. The one where I mostly had that impression was [big famous company]. I just had a general feeling when I walked on the campus, it felt like a slightly over-age college campus, a bunch of 30 year olds. They don&#8217;t really seem to have a place for somebody who&#8217;s 50 (unless, of course, you’re an executive). I’ve talked with friends in their 40s and 50s who have also felt that way when interviewing at some companies, especially startups. They may not blatantly say that you’re unwelcome, but the whole atmosphere can feel like </span><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2015/01/07/can-always-go-startup/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">there’s no place for you</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So ageism is definitely there and one way especially you see it come out is if you deal with social media. People just assume that “digital natives” are the only people who can do social media. No, actually experience helps there, too. If you didn&#8217;t keep hiring 20 year old interns to do your social media, you wouldn&#8217;t have these social media disasters that we always hear about in the press!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We&#8217;ve been interviewing people lately for our team at Ericsson, and I&#8217;ve actually been really pleased that our recruiter has brought in people who have not been afraid to say on their resume “20 years of experience.” It&#8217;s like—“Yes, experience! I like experience. This is good.” I&#8217;m happy to bring on young people and work with them and train them, but it&#8217;s also nice to have people I don&#8217;t have to train.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. It never occurred to me until this moment that someone would be afraid to put 20 years of experience on a resume here.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The received wisdom when you&#8217;re doing a resume is, &#8220;Don&#8217;t put your experience too far back, because that dates you. Don&#8217;t say what year you got your college degree, because if it&#8217;s pre-2000, you&#8217;re too old.&#8221; People are trying to find ways to fudge how old they actually are. I gave up trying to hide my age a while ago, because it&#8217;s pretty clear. I had things on my website about turning 50, so anybody who does a minimum of research is going to figure that one out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did draw the line at getting bifocals. My optometrist said, &#8220;You would be much better off for seeing and reading if you got bifocals.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;m in tech. I cannot be walking around with bifocals.&#8221; Or gray hair. </span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m also curious about forms of sexism that you mentioned you’ve experienced in the workplace.</b></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve got that geeky oblivious thing, there&#8217;s probably been a lot of stuff over the years that I just haven&#8217;t noticed, or haven&#8217;t picked up on.</p>\n<p>There have been times that I&#8217;ve worn makeup and skirts and heels. Lately I&#8217;ve had to give up makeup, partly because I have such bad seasonal allergies that my eyes get irritated really easily, plus one of the fun side effects of chemo is it makes your eyes really sensitive. Even now, every time I go outside my eyes start watering. There is just no makeup that’s going to survive that. But people don’t know that, and no doubt there are some who think that I’m making some sort of statement by refusing to wear makeup.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clothing is always a huge problem. As Deborah Tannen says, there is no “unmarked” look for women. It’s very hard to know how to dress for work. For a while I was wearing low-cut tops and showing cleavage, until I realized that it was just distracting for people. I think it&#8217;s just biological. It&#8217;s like, if there&#8217;s breasts out there, we all look at them (women, too). Maybe it&#8217;s a survival thing: as babies, we had to be focused on the breast. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was having a conversation once with a colleague. We&#8217;re having a perfectly sane, rational conversation and right in the middle of it, he stops and he&#8217;s doing this [staring at my chest]. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, I just can&#8217;t do this to these guys. It&#8217;s not fair [chuckles].&#8221; Since then I&#8217;m not exposing so much. [laughter]</span></p>\n<p><b>Let&#8217;s go into another kind of form of isolation that we talked about earlier in your interview, about not being technical.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being technical? As in, having a technical degree?</span></p>\n<p><b>Yep, and the importance given to that and how it has affected your career. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My college degree was in Asian Studies and Languages partly because, back in the 80s when Reagan was cutting education funding, the US government paid me to study “exotic” languages, in hopes that I would go work for the CIA (I didn’t). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The things I do now for my job didn’t even exist when I was in college, so I could not have studied them. But many of the skills I use now I learned in the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">jobs</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I did then to earn pocket money. I was always interested in technology and I’m a fast learner. I have been a writer since childhood, and that helps in any job.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I took one programming course, my freshman year, but it went very badly. I’m now not sure if that was because I sucked at it, or the course or the professor just weren’t that good. I never considered any further technical courses. No one ever suggested it to me, either. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I never learned to code (unless you count HTML), but I am good at figuring out and using and explaining technology. Whether for jobs or for myself, I am constantly learning. In 2001, I paid for lynda dot com to learn how to use Dreamweaver, the best website production software available at the time. I started my own website to have a place to put my writing, but I also used it to learn about how to build a site, how to analyze and improve web traffic, etc. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are lots of people out there who code without having computer science degrees. Should we really emphasize the CS degree that much? Yeah, there&#8217;s a lot basic engineering that you can learn in a CS degree, but it&#8217;s also a field that changes rapidly. Ironically, I have known engineers who insist on the value of a CS degree, while despising people who are academic computer scientists: “They don’t have real world experience.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CS degrees are valuable, but they&#8217;re not the only things that are valuable. I particularly find it distressing that companies looking to hire new grads keep talking to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">same</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> universities. This tends to reinforce biases: the majority of people who are coming out of most CS programs at the moment are white men. So we just keep that cycle going where somebody who&#8217;s graduated from Brown says: &#8221; I really want to talk to candidates from Brown,&#8221; and he hires candidates from Brown, and they&#8217;re going to be more white men. And so it goes on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I think it would help diversity if we thought harder about diversity of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">qualifications</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. A lot of companies are putting money into building the STEM pipeline. “Let&#8217;s get girls into STEM careers starting from middle school, and let&#8217;s help fund women to do CS degrees at university level.” That&#8217;s nice (and great PR), but it&#8217;s something a company will never be able to measure. There is almost never going to be somebody that you can say, &#8220;We paid for this program at some middle school, and this person ended up working for us.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The emphasis on building the pipeline also takes away attention from the very real problems for the people who are already in the job market and in the jobs. What&#8217;s making it hard to retain them? We as minorities and disadvantaged people keep telling companies [what’s wrong] &#8211; or we try to. And yet the problems keep happening.</span></p>\n<p><b>How did all this affect your personal life?</b></p>\n<p>It’s hard to talk about this without getting into stuff that is too personal and potentially hurtful for others for me to be very specific right now. So I’ll try to distill it down.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.beginningwithi.com/2008/09/01/the-bi-professional-couple-a-conundrum-close-to-the-bone/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s very, very hard to be a two-career couple</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, especially when you have kids. It’s rare that you can both be doing exactly what you want, where you want, when you want, and still maintain a life together. There have to be compromises. For most heterosexual couples, given the cultural assumptions about family roles and work, it’s the woman who does the compromising. I do know a few couples where the woman’s career has taken precedence, and the man’s career takes a backseat or he even becomes a stay-at-home father. It works fine for them, but we notice it precisely because it’s rare.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even with couples who say they believe in sharing housework and childcare equally, women end up doing the lion’s share of it – we know this from research as well as personal experience. All the assumptions and habits we all grew up with are stacked against us. Maybe women just care more about having clean houses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only solution I ever found to arguments and resentments over housework was to pay someone else to do it! I came to that conclusion 20 years ago when I was working as a consultant and my hourly rate was far higher than the hourly cost of paying someone to clean my home – it made no economic sense for me spend those hours cleaning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best piece of wisdom I could give anyone about any relationship is: be with someone who values the same things in you that you value in yourself.</span></p>\n<p>If your career is important to you, you need to be with someone who values that, who respects your right and need to do something in the world and supports you in that. Again, this usually requires compromise. And historically it’s been very hard for a woman to find a man who would even temporarily bend his own career trajectory to suit hers.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many men (and women) of my generation grew up with stay-at-home moms, or moms whose careers were secondary to their husbands’. I grew up with feminism and being </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">told</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that women’s needs and careers were equally important, but I didn’t see this demonstrated in my daily life. So for a long time I accepted that my husband’s career was more important than mine. When I began to really want to pursue my career, that caused tremendous friction in our relationship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It eventually came to the point that no further compromise was possible: his job was in Italy, but I could no longer find work there commensurate with my experience, skills, and interests (nor can most Italians!). I accepted a job back in the US in 2008, and we finally broke up 18 months later.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have some hope that there is a generational change going on. Many younger men and women have now grown up with mothers (increasingly, single mothers) who have important jobs. They understand instinctively that, yes, Mom works, and her career matters at least as much as Dad’s does. There’s still a lot of cultural pressure about how a woman is supposed to put her relationships and family first, but maybe younger men will be more supportive of their women’s careers. Maybe!</span></p>\n<p><b>My last question for you if you have the time would be, what is some of the advice that you could share to folks, a woman just starting out. What do you wish you’d known in the beginning in your career?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a bunch of standard advice people give that is absolutely true, for example: learning to negotiate for yourself is vitally important. My failures to negotiate salary earlier in life have scary consequences for my future retirement funds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need a sponsor as well as mentors. As a wise person has said: “Mentors help you skill up, whereas sponsors help you move up.” I haven’t had mentors, but I have had sponsors at two critical points in my career who have been almost literally lifesavers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Networking” sounds like a cynical term, but there’s nothing wrong with knowing a lot of people and using those connections – as long as you also pay it back, pay it forward, and help others wherever you can. We do need to help each other. Most people deserve it and it’s a good thing to do, but especially we need to help each other as women and as other under-represented people. Because it&#8217;s so hard for us to get into tech and stay without that support and help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anything you say ends up sounding sort of cliché, but believing in yourself and standing up for yourself&#8230; those are important, too. If I could go back, I would probably be less inclined to let some things go that I let go before, such as other people taking credit for my work. Of course, there were times when I stood up for myself and it did absolutely no good!</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, if you don&#8217;t try, you&#8217;ll definitely get nowhere.</span></p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Why don&#8217;t we start from the beginning? Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born and raised in Michigan in the Metro-Detroit area. I was adopted and grew up actually quite privileged—my dad&#8217;s a lawyer. Growing up, I&#8217;ve never necessarily wanted or needed to want anything. But I definitely went through life questioning my gender which stemmed a lot of misguided anger that I have—at least I realize that now, looking back on those years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had a pretty normal childhood. I was definitely very nerdy and less masculine than the rest of the boys and got made fun of that and by the time high school came around, I figured, &#8220;Hey, smoking weed kind of helps me, you know, fit in with everybody else and forget about my gender issues. This fits.”  But by the end of freshman year, I was failing by a credit and my parents decided to send me to boarding school in Utah. I have a lot of feels about how they spent this ridiculous amount of money to force me back into not fitting in and living with these terrible boys who wanted nothing but to see the humor that was me losing my temper and attempting to fight them. All this instead of critically thinking about why I may be taking my issues out on drugs.</span></p>\n<p>The drug use actually did get worse when I got back home and into my early to mid 20’s where I failed college. I ended up taking a couple years off though to regroup and ended up going to Broadcasting School which got me a job a few years later as a photojournalist in Northern Michigan, which is not where you want to be when you’re a queer person just starting to come to terms with your gender.</p>\n<p><b>Where in Michigan? I love Michigan. I’ve almost moved to Detroit a couple of times.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was in Cadillac, Traverse City, and Petoskey. That&#8217;s like—[puts hand up to represent the ‘mitten’ shape of Michigan] Here, here, here [points to areas near the fingertips on the left side]</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;ve been there!</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cabin fever set in after a little while and I didn&#8217;t really enjoy the work, and I wasn&#8217;t being paid well. At that point in time, I was ready to start talking to people who were questioning their gender so I could get a little bit better perspective, and those people weren&#8217;t available in northern Michigan. So I quit my job, and came back down to the Metro area, and started freelancing video productions and web design. Started getting really good with web design and after about a year of doing that, I realized I was actually doing the thing and making a living and I was really happy, but there was still something missing. That&#8217;s when I started my transition. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My transition actually went fairly well and mostly uneventful and I wonder why. My interactions with the shittiness of other people towards transwomen and transpeople in general, have come more recently rather than originally. It actually took until I went full-time to have my first truly awful experience. I’m well aware that I&#8217;ve been personally very privileged to have had a pretty uneventful transition, up until now.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>So you went from photo journalism in northern Michigan to eventually product designer in San Francisco. How did that happen?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, the thing about video production is that it take a lot from different visual and other mediums, graphic design being one that I excelled at.  Also, I had previous web development experience in high school. Actually, as early as middle school, I was taking my lunch break to work on my GeoCities site type of stuff, but moved away from it because web technologies associated with design were terrible up until about 2010.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I knew when I quit my job that video wasn’t going to pay the bills so I spent some time re-learning web technologies. I also had this theory that if most of my productions were going to end up online and I was building the content—why not also build the frame?  I started doing both concurrently and picked up new talents such as motion graphics (which translated really well to developing interaction prototypes) along the way though, after a while the video work kinda dried up and became a side gig. I just wasn’t very good at the hustle that was needed to procure video clients and convince them of the value of that work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The web work eventually turned into more design focused work when a client of mine realized that was really where I shined. I was able to work on a few apps and some enterprise style websites that helped pad my portfolio.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So over the course of about a year I transitioned my work and life congruously, and at that point I was just bored of being freelance in Michigan, and kinda burnt out by the hours being high and the billable hours being low. I had always planned to come to the queer and tech mecca of SF, so I decided to put that together over about 7 months and flew here with a large suitcase, a backpack and a longboard that I had yet learned to ride.</span></p>\n<p><b>What were your first impressions of Silicon Valley? What were you expecting? How did it live up, or not live up to your expectations?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s everything I hoped it to be, but I was definitely able to check my privilege quite a bit, moving out here, and see that it&#8217;s not all roses, and whatever that saying is. Life is lived out here, which is crazy. I was definitely sheltered from a lot of that, until I moved out here. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of my friends are struggling. In the past year I&#8217;ve made two friends who are homeless, and being able to help them where I can, and being able to see the struggle they deal with on the daily—it definitely allowed me to step back and think about how I see the world</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and interact with people and create art.</span></p>\n<p><b>When you moved to San Francisco, you were making 1,500 dollars a month, and it took you four months to find a full-time gig. Describe that time in your life.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, I tried to find a roommate living situation before moving out here, but it didn’t work out, so I ended up paying for a month in an AirBnB hostel in the Outer Sunset where I lived with about 5-6 people while I looked for a more long-term living arrangement. After about 3 weeks I ended up finding a room in Oakland for $500 a month which was super lucky.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I actually ended up coming out here a week earlier than I planned because I had an interview with Charles Schwab fall in my lap. They ended up giving me some bullshit line of I&#8217;m too good for the job or something like that, you know, it was garbage. Apparently they changed the job description and are moving a lot of their jobs to Texas. I probably didn&#8217;t want to work there anyway.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, I got settled into Oakland and I was working on job hunting while fulfilling the hours I owed my client back in Michigan. I didn’t even get an interview for another 2 months. I think I really had to hone my resume to the Bay Area compared to what would have probably been acceptable in Michigan. I spent a lot of time working with the offerings at the SF LGBT center, specifically the TEEI program and the job clubs to update my resume. I had a lot of free time so I jumped on the opportunity to redesign my portfolio website as well as go to tech meet-ups and learn and connect with people. Also, of course, starting my life over and meeting new people, and learning to skateboard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I ended up getting connected to my now boss randomly on Angel List—the only connection I had on there and he actually reached out to me before I even submitted to anyone. We had a couple of interviews. I wasn’t entirely sold on the job at first so I was a lot less on edge in the job interview and more myself, I guess you could say. You know, instead of the caricature of yourself you put on in job interviews. I think that helped. Anyways, I’ve been there since July in a contractor capacity and they’re officially hiring me next week.</span></p>\n<p><b>Woo-hoo! Congrats!</b></p>\n<p>Yeah. It was supposed to happen within three months, but we were also six months behind schedule on launching and everything, so&#8230; [chuckles]</p>\n<p><b>Happens.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah.</span></p>\n<p><b>I want to know more about Allytees.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://www.allytees.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Allytees</a>? Did you go to the website?</span></p>\n<p><b>Mm-hmm.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So my best friend and I had been for a while thinking about different ways that we could give something to the LGBT community. The idea is that we have a way for allies of LGBT people to show their support by boldly claiming a person close to them is trans, gay, genderqueer, lesbian, asexual, etc. on a shirt. The shirt literally reads “my blank is a blank” or “My mom is a lesbian” or “My best friend is transgender.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now we could do this by having pages upon pages of items in an e-commerce site with all the different combinations of relationship to identification… but that would come out to something like 500 items for the variations of one product.  We could also have some dropdown to the side that the user could select, but that wasn’t any fun. We knew from the start that we had to allow the user to mockup the shirt on the shirt itself… something neither of us had ever seen before… here you&#8217;re given a product, an idea of a product, and here&#8217;s how you can modify it within these parameters. And I still have yet to see any website do that, where you actually mock up the product on the product itself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It actually wouldn&#8217;t have been possible for us to do it if there weren&#8217;t the fulfillment options of direct to garment printing available. And at the time there was only one, and another one kind of getting its shit together. Now there&#8217;s like ten of them, literally like a year later, there&#8217;s like ten of these companies that allow you to send them orders over an API and they’ll print on demand and send to your customers. Joe and I actually needed some help with the API integration stuff and I was able to hire a developer—another trans woman—to do it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was nice to be able to invest in something for my community and also help get a solid portfolio piece on two people’s resume which eventually helped get us all jobs. </span></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s really awesome.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, yeah, it was really nice.</span></p>\n<p><b>What else has been really exciting to you about your work? What really activates you about design and product?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what’s really gotten me is that this is real now. I’m a creative for a living which is freaky as hell, but I know this and much of the work is iterative and ultimately you end at those “aha” moment that really lift your spirits. It’s kind of a gut punch—a good gut punch—while you’re standing there looking at your work going  &#8220;Oh wait, fuck. Oh shit, that&#8217;s great!&#8221; Then you&#8217;re really excited about it. And then getting other people riled up about it as well and being a cheerleader for your own work is really the thing that moves me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improving on previous work is huge too. Knowing that you’re always learning. Maybe by the time you launch a design already feels long in the tooth, but you figure out what to do a couple weeks or months later and start working to implement the change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes having to rush and put out work that you’re not entirely happy with but you end up getting positive feedback from is also kind of a stellar feeling. And being able to get to a point where I understand the logical aspect of why the design is the design. And why we have to push towards moving the design in this new direction because the current design is failing to keep up with the functionality. So it&#8217;s very much a whole brain task to do product design and that works with me very well. It&#8217;s very symbiotic with my personality and my ability as I generally approach product design, and other art I do in general, from both a creative and structural/logical perspective.</span></p>\n<p><b>What been your experience been like in Silicon Valley as someone out as trans?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The thing is, I&#8217;ve never actually had the conversation, the trans conversation with my boss.</span></p>\n<p><b>Interesting.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know that I&#8217;m visibly trans, but I&#8217;ve never—that conversation has never come up.</span></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s cool.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were many times I would normally just talk about being trans, but I didn&#8217;t want to bring it up because I&#8217;ve been a contractor, and it&#8217;s easier to just say, &#8220;hey, goodbye contractor&#8221; than, &#8220;hey, goodbye employee.&#8221; But </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve never had a problem with pronouns or anything like that. It weirds me out, but at the same time, I&#8217;m aware that I&#8217;m visible, so I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s going on in their heads at the same time so like whether, &#8220;Do they see it or do they not see it? Is it possible that they don&#8217;t see that I&#8217;m trans?&#8221;</span></i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who knows?</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I&#8217;m sure that conversation will come up at some point, especially once I start looking to use my benefits for my transition. I guess I’m just gonna ride this train as long as possible. Aside from being at work, I have felt, going to networking and stuff like that has been difficult. Never had any direct shittiness from people but kind of feel sometimes like I may not necessarily belong here.  So I definitely feel more comfortable in spaces of people who are marginalized. Like the &#8220;I Look Like An Engineer&#8221; campaign that went on. I was actually on the billboard, and was able to go to that, and that felt really good to be a part of stuff like that and I try to go to stuff like that and find a better community within the tech community with other people who aren&#8217;t cis white men. [chuckles]</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you find your support networks currently?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my friends, actually mostly my partners. It&#8217;s actually nice now to have—back when I was freelancing, I didn&#8217;t really have much of a separation of work and play. And now I do, and in the past year, I&#8217;ve found that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">polyamory</a> is kind of my M.O. for living my life with people that I care about. I find support in my partners, and the people who give a shit about me. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve found a lot of love in the Bay area since I&#8217;ve moved here, and it&#8217;s quite stunning. That&#8217;s really what keeps me going.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s beautiful. What is it like for you personally, straddling worlds of privilege like tech, and then other worlds that are underrepresented?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s a constant mental battle that I have. It&#8217;s something that I think about and unpack on a daily basis. I have these breakthroughs every once in awhile, where I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Okay. I don&#8217;t necessarily know how to express or talk about what I’m feeling with that.” But I want to make sure that I do right by my community and other communities that may need a collectively louder voice. It’s something that I’ve been more aware of since I moved out here and  I’ve been heavily unpacking it ever since. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think mainly I want to use my art to help the community—you know—what I’m good at doing. I’ve been asked in the past to do things like canvassing and cold calling, which just makes me uncomfortable—makes all parties uncomfortable. I want to find ways where I can contribute in the highest capacity. For example the NTCE did a trans survey last year and needed a designer for the report. They were paying in this case, but I’d totally do something along those lines in my free time if an org needed it. I would have taken the NTCE, but I’m already slammed with two product launches coming up, so it was just bad timing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also have my own art projects that I can hopefully contribute to the zeitgeist that will push trans people forward.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in 5 or 10 years? Do you think you&#8217;ll still be here in the Valley?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hope so. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I really like Oakland. I really like my friends that I’ve made in the past year. I really like the opportunities that I have to create not only for myself, but also for all the cute queer trans kids. It’s quite magical here.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m looking forward to working on a few side projects. One is a slap-in-the-face video series about trans-women doing day to day things. I also have a longer mini-series that a friend is writing about a group of trans-women that I’ll be directing next year once pre-production is done. That’s a much a larger project.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also working on a space for queer and trans artists to sell their wares. Kind of an extension of the Allytees thing, I think we did a lot right, but did a lot wrong, and I’ve been contemplating what the new brand will look like and how it will help to pay marginalized people for their ideas.</span></p>\n<p><b>My last question for you would be, what advice would you give to folks from similar backgrounds to you who are hoping to get into tech or just make it work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many factors and as I said before I’ve been very lucky to make it where I am today, but the core tenants of my being are having a passion for something and having some semblance of confidence in my ability to do the thing that I’m passionate about. But </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">don’t be an asshole. If you come from a home that’s well off, it’s easy to dismiss things that you don’t understand or make fun of it, or assert your dominance over it. I mean, I could have very easily been a gatekeeper-type transwoman who tells other transwomen they’re not trans enough, but that’s never cool and shit like that needs to be called out. So, <a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wheatons-law\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wheaton’s law</a>. Don’t be a dick.</span></i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Why don&#8217;t we start from the top. Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I grew up in a bunch of different places. My parents moved around a lot while I was a kid. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My parents immigrated here to the U.S. from Indonesia when I was two. My dad is a civil engineer and he tried to find a job as a civil engineer. No one, no lab that he wanted to work for, would recognize his college degree because it was foreign. The only way for him to get the kind of jobs he wanted to do was to go back to school. He tried for a while—I think he was a janitor for the first couple of months that he lived here because that was the only job he could get hired for.</span></i> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He was like, &#8220;What am I doing here, working as a janitor, when I know I’m really good at my job as a civil engineer.&#8221; He went back to school and that&#8217;s kind of why we moved around a lot. He went to school in Chicago and then Colorado, then finally found a job as a civil engineer in Mississippi. That&#8217;s most where I did most of my growing up. He works a lot with river erosion and flooding, and so Mississippi is like a great place for that. So that’s how I ended up growing up in the South.</span></p>\n<p><b>What was it like being an immigrant family in the deep south?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was super interesting. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was the only Asian kid in my class. There was one other Asian girl in my school. Teachers got us confused. They couldn&#8217;t tell us apart. I was so worried when I went to college that no one would know who I was, because I went to university somewhere where students were 30% Asian. I was like, &#8220;No one&#8217;s going to even know who I am!&#8221;</span></i></p>\n<p><b>Oh my goodness. I&#8217;m curious, just as someone who grew up in small-town South, were you exposed to creativity and technology in school? How did you discover it?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess not really. We had like a typing class at school, and that&#8217;s kind of as far as that went. I did have really amazing English and History classes, but as far as technology exposure, it was mostly going to the library, reading lots and lots of books.</span></p>\n<p><b>What were your parents’ expectations of you? What did they want you to be when you grew up?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They mostly wanted to make sure I would be able to support myself with because they were all about making sure I would grow up to be self-sufficient with a fulfilling career.</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m curious to hear more about your academic experience.</b></p>\n<p>In school, I loved basically every single subject. And a good teacher could make me like subjects in school that I wouldn’t have liked on my own. My two biggest loves were probably science and art. I even thought about majoring in art and I actually talked with some reps from art colleges in the south. Their programs sounded amazing, but I also still really loved math and wanted to make sure I could continue pursuing that. I remember asking one of the art school reps what the highest math class was at their university. They told me college algebra, and I had like already had taken college algebra my sophomore year of high school. I really wanted to be an adult who both knew life drawing and multivariable calculus. And it was like hard to figure out how to be that kind of an adult.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I ended up going to school in computer science and electrical engineering and I still tried to do creative stuff on the side. I was in my university’s symphony orchestra. I took creative writing classes and foreign language classes. And I would doodle in all of my notes—if you like flip through my notes about machine learning, you’d see drawings of flowers scattered amongst the neural networks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every time I took a class within my major it made me more confused instead of less confused about what I wanted to do with my life. I loved both my first software class and my first hardware class and wondered whether I should do software or hardware as a career. And I fell in love with so many other classes in my major: signal processing, image processing, computer graphics. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of my friends in grad school pointed out to me that no matter like what I was doing, whether it was like science-y or math-y or art, what I really liked doing was to making stuff. No matter what class, I would be a lot more motivated to make an awesome final project than to study for for a test. I realized I was happy to go above and beyond—reading newly published academic papers, putting in extra hours every night, in order to make a final project I could be proud of. And once I had that realization about myself, I feel like I stopped fighting with myself about whether I was an artist or a technologist. I was just a person who liked to make awesome shit.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>So, let&#8217;s fast forward to career time. Tell me about some of the most exciting, wonderful things that you worked on in your career, like stuff that you&#8217;re just super proud of?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After grad school I moved to Japan (that was the foreign language I had concentrated on in college), and the first year in Japan I worked at <a href=\"http://www.honda-ri.com/HRI_Us/\" target=\"_blank\">Honda Research Institute</a>. They make humanoid robots called <a href=\"http://asimo.honda.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ASIMO</a>. So I worked on a learning system for ASIMO based on the way babies and toddlers learn. Babies and toddlers often look up to their parents and use their parent’s expression to assess whether they&#8217;re doing the right thing or not. If they do something, and they look up, and their parent looks disappointed, the child thinks, &#8220;Uh oh. Maybe I shouldn&#8217;t have done that.&#8221; Or if they look up, and their parent looks proud of them, then they&#8217;ll conclude, &#8220;I must be doing the right thing.&#8221; ASIMO can see the person in front of him while he&#8217;s completing a task. So, he&#8217;ll look up and assess their face. We used an SDK from the <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">MIT Media Lab</a> that can tell whether the person supervising ASIMO is disappointed or pleased and ASIMO use that as feedback for whether to continue that direction or to try something totally different. That was super fun to work on.</span></p>\n<p><b>So cool. Then after Japan, did you come straight to Silicon Valley?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did. I spent a year at Honda. Then I also did one year of research at the University of Tokyo at their Media Lab. And then to San Francisco.  </span></p>\n<p><b>What were your first impressions of Silicon Valley?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like I had a really different impression of Silicon Valley than a lot of people because I had come straight from Japan. In Japan, casual clothing had meant pants and a button up shirt instead of a full on suit. But here when people say casual, they actually mean really casual.</span></p>\n<p><b>For sure. So, you&#8217;ve worked at a combo of tiny startups here and bigger companies. Walk me through some of that.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first startup that I worked at in San Francisco was a tiny YC startup called <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/1000memories\" target=\"_blank\">1000memories</a> and that was an interesting experience, and really different from working at a big company, because at a tiny company, everyone ends up doing everything, from on call ops through customer support. All the engineers did frontend, backend, devops. So you learn how to do everything, because you have to.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. And then from there, you were responsible of building the whole growth team, right? Airbnb?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh yeah, after I worked there for a year, I moved to Airbnb.</span></p>\n<p><b>How was that?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was pretty amazing. When I joined Airbnb, it was still pretty small. I was the third woman engineer, and the 20th engineer overall. Now I think there are over 200 engineers there. And the time I joined, there wasn&#8217;t a growth team. But when I was implementing some stuff on the site I wanted to make sure that what we were building would be easy to use. So I roped in someone on the analytics team (Topher Lin) to help me measure everything I built. The head of product at the time, Joe Zadeh, saw what the two of us were doing and said, &#8220;I’ve always wanted a Growth team, and that&#8217;s basically what the two of you were doing—building stuff, proving that users like it with analytics. So, I want you two be our first Growth team.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><b>So cool. What was the process like, building and managing a team, compared to startup of just executing everything, and then going into this more strategic role?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was really great. We got to interview the first Growth team project manager, who is still there now and who is super awesome, Gustaf Alstromer. I didn&#8217;t want us to be a growth team that used slimy tactics or who put up a wall to make people sign up. We really wanted the growth to be founded on metrics, and also use the power of the community telling their stories. We wanted to help people tell their stories because happy customers is the best way to grow. When we talked to Gustav about what his ideas about growth were, they completely lined up. He was like, &#8220;I want to help our users to tell their stories. I want this to be organic. I don&#8217;t want to be slimy,&#8221; so it was a perfect match.</span></p>\n<p><b>Awesome.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah.</span></p>\n<p><b>And then you started your own company. Tell me about that experience—what it is and what was the impetus for starting it.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year when I started <a href=\"http://bubblesort-zines.myshopify.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BubbleSort</a> I had been in the industry for seven years and it felt like a long time. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I felt like it was time to switch from being a programmer to sharing with other people what I loved about programming. And I wanted to share that joy in ways that I felt the current computer science curriculum was lacking.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>Strategically, did you know it would be zines? Walk me through why you decided to make it in the way that you did.</b></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was 13, I was reading a really dry science textbook and I made up my mind that one day I was going to write a math and science textbook that was going to be in cartoon format with lots of drawings for the visual learner because I think that visual learners often get left out of education.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m curious how all of your work and life experience impacts how you are approaching your work now.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a person who has lots of interests besides technology, I try to relate computing concepts to history, art, literature, and other subjects. As someone who often felt discouraged while studying computer science, I try to explain complex technical concepts in a clear and non-condescending way, because I want readers to leave feeling “yeah! I can totally understand this!” And above all, I wanted people reading the zines to see technology as a way to be creative.</span></p>\n<p><b>How has the experience been connecting with people who are using your zines?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s been pretty amazing. I have gotten emails from moms who say that they watch their daughters reading the zines and see them squee and light up. I’ve gotten emails from college students who say they were feeling discouraged about picking computer science as a major but the zines have made them feel like they made the right choice after all. Every time I get an email like that I know I’m doing the right thing.</span></p>\n<p><b>Ok, let&#8217;s switch to the dark side for a sec. I am curious about kind of the hardships that you&#8217;ve experienced or the roadblocks, particularly as a woman in tech, but it could just be as a person in tech. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I remember feeling discouraged about my decision to be an engineer, starting in college. I felt like my classmates were all way smarter than me. I also remember a college boyfriend telling me that the final projects I had picked for myself were way beyond my level and that I should pick easier projects. It was really jarring to have a person who was supposed to be supportive of me be the exact opposite of supportive.  But because I&#8217;m really contrary, it made me even more determined than usual to make my final project awesome. And not only did I complete the project successfully, at the end of the semester, my professor gave me an award for best project in the class. </span></p>\n<p><b>Did this continue once you joined the workforce?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Definitely. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve worked at places where my manager assumed that anything wrong with the website was my bug, just because I was the only woman on the team. I would even get calls during the middle of the night, or early in the morning, or when I was on vacation, blaming me for bugs that I could prove via git-blame had nothing to do with me. I&#8217;ve also had advisors refuse to give me help because they were romantically attracted to me. They would tell me that they would only give me advice if it was over dinner. So I would do research and write papers completely unadvised, because I would refuse to go on a dinner date with them.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, you talked about in your pre-interview being underestimated by male peers and supervisors. And you mentioned being stalked and harassed as well. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, that research advisor that I just mentioned, couldn&#8217;t take no for an answer, and so one time even tried to follow me home after work. He apologized to me the next day about doing that, but then after his apology, tried to forcibly kiss me. So, I’m pretty sure he wasn’t actually sorry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s really horrible when a supervisor tries something like that because of the power dynamic of it. Knowingly using your position of power to get someone to date you is just gross.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where have you found your support groups of your time in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My friends, other women in tech. It&#8217;s really sad, but there are lots of other women in tech who have experienced similar things, and can talk to you about this, and have your back. And when you talk to them, you&#8217;re both really glad that you have someone to talk to about this, and really sad that so many other people like you have experienced something like that.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. I&#8217;m curious, based on my own experience—like when I worked in tech, I always felt like I had to act way older and more masculine than I was for people to believe I knew what I was talking about. There were a lot of things that I felt like I had to suppress in my personality to survive, and now that I’m a free agent I act ten years younger [laughter]. And I know you&#8217;re this amazing girl who is way into girly stuff and awesome fashion, and you&#8217;re so self-expressive. Did you feel like you had to suppress any of that in your previous jobs? And do you feel more like a free woman now through working for yourself?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aww, thanks! I think that going into college I acted like one of those cool girls who thought they weren’t like other girls. Most of my friends were guys who were also interested in science and engineering. But in college, I lived in a dorm that was all women. I lived with 300 women who were all amazing at math and science. At first, it was super intimidating because I&#8217;d defined myself so long as the girl who good at math and science, suddenly I lived with 300 other women who were good at math and science. Part of me felt threatened and panicked. I went from feeling that way to doing homework with these amazing women, cooking with them, and being friends with them and realizing it was way better to have their friendship and support than getting to feel like the one special woman who was amazing at math and science. And that&#8217;s also when I started embracing feminism and became more at home with my own femininity, because I wasn’t trying to prove that i was the “cool girl” any longer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before my interview at Airbnb, I had put on an outfit that I thought was a sensible outfit, and I was looking at myself in the mirror and not really feeling it. I decided to put on one of my favorite sweaters, a very fuzzy sweater with rabbits on it, but looking in the mirror I thought to myself, &#8220;I really like this but I not sure if looks professional.&#8221; And the next thought I had for myself was, &#8220;Fuck it, if they won&#8217;t hire me this way, I don&#8217;t want to work there.&#8221; I do realize that that requires an amount of privilege to be able to say, because if you really need the job, you might feel like you can’t take those kinds of risks. But I had gotten to the point in my career where I felt ok doing that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, totally. I had a thought—oh, I don&#8217;t know, it just reminds me of some other interviews I&#8217;ve done, this theme of like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the more women end up working together in tech, eventually the more women engineers are in a team, suddenly that person doesn&#8217;t have to feel like the token female engineer. Like, suddenly you get to express yourself, and not just have to represent all women in your role. Like, you can suddenly you want, and just be your own individual self instead of carrying the burden of representing “all Lady &#8216;Devs. It&#8217;s really interesting to me. </span></i></p>\n<p><b>What are your biggest motivators? What drives your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think my biggest motivator is people. With Bubblesort Zines right now, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it&#8217;s really important for me to be writing a resource that will make people feel like they can understand technology, that they belong here, and that it&#8217;s not too hard for them, and that no matter what their background is, they bring something valuable to the table.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When I was working as a front-end designer, it was my main motivator was building websites that would be easy for people to use and to bring value to their lives.</span></p>\n<p><b>What do you look for in your work now versus when you started?</b></p>\n<p>Like, in a place to work, or&#8230;</p>\n<p><b>Yeah. I mean, it&#8217;s a funny question for you because you&#8217;re an entrepreneur. But yeah, what is the most valuable thing to you in your job? Be it like what you&#8217;re doing now, and how does that compare to when you first started? What priorities have been become, or what priorities have become more important to you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While writing BubbleSort Zines, I get to do a variety of things every day—I read books and papers for research, draw a lot of diagrams and comics, and write little stories to illustrate different algorithms or different computer science concepts. I never thought before that I would have a job where I get to be technical and artistic on a daily basis. So I guess the most important thing to me right now about a job is being allowed and encouraged to be my entire self, the analytical side of myself and also the more creative side.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do your family and friends from home feel about how far you&#8217;ve come and the work that you&#8217;ve done?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got really excited new the other day that my hometown high school wants to use BubbleSort Zines for their computer class next year, so that felt very cool and full circle!</span></p>\n<p><b>We&#8217;ve obviously touched on points of this, but how do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? What really excites you? What frustrates you? What would you like to see change?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am really excited about self-driving cars. I think it will be amazing when roads are safer; I feel like it&#8217;s a technology that&#8217;s going to  impact people and save a lot of lives. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The things that make me frustrated—I wish that tech companies would prioritize people (their employees and their users) over profit. And related to that, most people make technology for themselves, to solve the problems that they personally face, and I think that&#8217;s why tech needs to be more diverse, because in order to solve everyone&#8217;s problems we need to involve everyone.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>On that note, I&#8217;m curious to know your thoughts on how tech could be more accommodating to diverse folks, both women and everybody else on the spectrum. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being inclusive can start from job descriptions when companies are looking to hire people. There&#8217;s a lot of research that shows that if you write descriptions like, &#8220;Come work for us on super cutting-edge technology, challenge yourself and work with state-of-the-art algorithm,&#8221; versus like, &#8220;Come work with us and build tech that will impact people&#8217;s lives and make their lives better.&#8221; Research shows that a lot of women and marginalized people will react much better to copy the second. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">once you have people working for you that are from more diverse backgrounds, make sure you treat them well so that they stay. Make sure that they’re being promoted and recognized at the same rates as the white men that you’ve hired. If they speak up about something that makes them uncomfortable, listen to them. When someone speaks up about their experience and it’s completely different from your experience, it&#8217;s really easy to treat it as if they have a bug on their computer that you haven’t noticed, like &#8220;That bug doesn&#8217;t happen for me.&#8221; But if a marginalized person complains to you about something they&#8217;ve experienced at work and your first reaction is, &#8220;well I&#8217;ve never had that experience,&#8221; that&#8217;s the wrong reaction to have.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So listen to your employees and co-workers when they tell you about stuff in the workplace that bothers them or upsets them, and believe them.</span></p>\n<p><b>My last question would be&#8230; what advice would you give to young ladies who are really interested in tech and want to potentially get into it but just don&#8217;t even know where to start?</b></p>\n<p>Reach out to a woman or marginalized person in tech you admire! That might seem intimidating, but it&#8217;s really likely that they&#8217;ll get back to you. Almost every time someone emails me to say that they want to get into tech, or that they want advice on how to get their career started, or they want to submit their first paper or talk, I see a younger version of myself and I feel honored that they’ve asked.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p>I was born and raised in Cupertino, CA. My parents are both from China, and immigrated here in their mid-20s, so growing up, I spent many summer vacations with my extended family in China.</p>\n<p><b>What was family life like? What did your family expect of your career-wise? What did you think you were going to be when you grew up?</b></p>\n<p>My parents are my ultimate heroes in life, and there is no way I can possibly overstate that. They immigrated here from China in the 80s, barely speaking the language and having just finished graduate school. When I was 10, they founded their own individual biotech companies, both as solo founders. They went up against crazy challenges and a language barrier, yet eventually led one to acquisition and one to IPO. As a kid, &#8220;growing up<i>&#8221; </i>alongside both of their ventures and witnessing the sheer force of their perseverance and hard work became one of my biggest sources of personal inspiration.</p>\n<p>When I was younger I had no idea that I would go into the arts, but I always knew that whatever I ended up doing would have some element of entrepreneurship involved. Also, I&#8217;ve learned a lot about the value of demonstrating to your kids the importance of hard work and passion for what you do (whether that&#8217;s in your work or the values with which you live your life).</p>\n<p>Honestly, when I am going through something challenging in my career I think about my parents, and how they came here with few resources, little knowledge of the language or how American society here even functions — and were still able to grow their initial visions into two multi-national companies today. And then I just think, <i>if they can do it, I can do this too. </i></p>\n<p>To me, they are the true embodiment of the American Dream: immigrants who, through <i>extremely</i> hard work and perseverance, have found success <i>on their own terms. </i></p>\n<p><b>How did you first get interested in tech and design?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve always been interested in design, but that was before I knew it was “called” design. When I was younger I’d delight in figuring out systems to make processes more efficient. I went to business school at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, and my major there was a business-related take on that (Operations &amp; Management). I got into design on my own, taking on internships that were on the business and platform sides, and studying from the designers in my spare time. I’d offer to take on extra projects that weren’t necessarily high priority for them, and in turn I ended up learning a lot about what it takes to ship a product. </span></p>\n<p><b>How’d you end up in SF and in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’d been interested in tech throughout college, taking on internships at <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://foursquare.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Foursquare</a> and <a href=\"https://path.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Path</a>, so it was something I wanted to continue afterwards. I’d always wanted to come back to SF after graduating from college because this is where I grew up. The fact that the tech industry has been in an upswing and was in an extremely optimistic place in 2012 helped too! </span></p>\n<p><b>What were your first impressions of Silicon Valley?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had a very positive initial impression of Silicon Valley, partly because I grew up here and a lot of it feels very natural and organically “at home” to me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s funny because often people here will refer to a particular location or “Bay Area thing” in a certain context, and for me it’ll always have specific connotations to high school and whatnot. For instance, sometimes after telling someone that I grew up in Cupertino, people will be like “Oh my gosh! What is it like there? Is it really cool?” and my answer is “Haha! It’s actually really boring.” Or, someone will ask if I want to meet at a certain coffee shop in Palo Alto, and that’s where I remember cramming for my SATs because I did all of my standardized testing at either Palo Alto or Gunn High Schools. </span></p>\n<p><b>What was the impetus for leaving to go freelance?</b></p>\n<p>There were many reasons but one thing that appealed to me more than going to work for a company was the idea that I could try out a lot of different things within the general world of illustration and art, and have that count as being part of my career. In the same vein I think that independent life is a particularly great option for people who have a lot of different interests that they want to combine in their professional lives.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, one day I’ll be painting a 10&#215;10 ft mural for Slack, and the next I’ll be lettering on a home goods project for Macy’s, and the next week I could be drawing an inventory of in-app product illustrations for Wealthfront. I also do a lot of personal experimentation and am starting to branch into some gallery work, which is extremely rewarding in its own way. It’s a really fun mix and I feel like I would not nearly have grown as much both technically as an artist/draftsman, nor would I be as strong a conceptual thinker had I stayed in one context. Those are qualities that I care about optimizing to the max at this point in my life and career. </span></p>\n<p><b>What has your experience been like as a freelancer?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My experience has been extremely positive, empowering, and affirming. It is really exciting to constantly feel like I am creating my best work and then see that shipped, live, and in context of a client’s project. I tend to be pretty particular about the projects that I take on, and my clients so far have all been truly wonderful people to collaborate with! </span></p>\n<p><b>In general, how has your experience been as a woman in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think a lot of the discrimination that women in tech face is extremely subtle &#8211; death by a million paper cuts. I feel the need to be extremely aware of where and who I’m working with because at the end of the day, I really do believe that the values of the industry at large do not include much empathy for people who don’t belong to the “default” identity (ie. white, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisgender\" target=\"_blank\">CIS</a> male, not an immigrant), and if I don’t do this for myself, then no one &#8211; not an HR department or my manager &#8211; will do so for me. I have really little faith in “things working themselves out” in this industry context unless I proactively look out for myself, and I see tech as one of many industries that I work within as an illustration (ie. from editorial, retail, to broader advertising), rather than a core piece of my identity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some ways, it’s somewhat analogous to my parents’ journey as CEOs in the US who immigrated here from another country. They encountered a lot of discrimination, both overt and subtle, especially given that their identity wasn’t accepted as the “default” identity of success (aka white, male, no accent) in our Western society. Perhaps certain things may have come more easily or directly to them had they belonged to that default identity, but I deeply admire their drive in carving out their own extremely unique paths to success that I think greatly trumps what the default path could have given them. </span></p>\n<p><b>Have you had mentors or people you’ve looked up to for inspiration along the way?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, many of them have been people I’ve gotten to work with (ie. <a href=\"http://ryanputn.am/\" target=\"_blank\">Ryan Putnam</a>, <a href=\"http://morganallanknutson.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Morgan Knutson</a>, <a href=\"http://allison.house/\" target=\"_blank\">Allison House</a>, etc), and recently I’ve started more official mentorship relationships with illustrators who work in the publishing and advertising industries. I think it’s cool to learn with people who come from a variety of different backgrounds! </span></p>\n<p><b>What are your biggest motivators?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All I can do in life is try my best. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also tend to get </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">really</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> inspired by others and their bodies of work; for instance I’m really digging Japanese director <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makoto_Shinkai\" target=\"_blank\">Makoto Shinkai’s</a> work right now and I’ve been practicing how to paint in his style. So I think having a lot of true, from-the-heart inspirations of older practicing artists (from the general art/illustration communities, not necessarily tech itself) has been extremely motivating for me. </span></p>\n<p><b>Where have you found support networks?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve found amazing support networks just in friends as well as this social Slack channel that I’m a part of that <a href=\"http://www.jedmund.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Justin Edmund</a> started (designer, formerly at Pinterest, first designer there). It’s a really cool group of people that I would broadly classify as individuals who consider themselves “makers” (ie. designers, engineers, illustrators, writers, founders, etc) and it’s a great place where we’ve been able to talk freely about things that I’d otherwise feel really vulnerable talking about “in public.” </span></p>\n<p><b>What do you look for in a job now vs. when you started?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I look for a lot of similar things (product and mission that I’m passionate about, solid business plan + trajectory, strong leadership, strong presence of design in the org, etc), but the difference is that now I look for more things like:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the HR practices in place to deal with workplace issues? Are there HR processes at all?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How empathetic do the founders, early members, and leadership appear to be? </span></p>\n<p>Inclusion: Are there women in positions of leadership? Is there a woman in a position close to the role that I will be taking who I can potentially talk to? What are the gender and broader diversity ratios in place, especially on the technical side (where I spend most of my time)?</p>\n<p><b>How do you think your background and life experiences impact the way you approach your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think my self-taught path from business school to illustrator who draws and paints professionally has unexpectedly resulted in an interesting pairing between business and art. </span></p>\n<p><b>So what are you working on right now, either for work or for yourself? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now I work with a bunch of companies like Slack, Wealthfront, Macy’s, etc. as well as smaller startups in the tech industry. I’ve also worked on a range of really cool projects, from editorial (ie. New York Times) to animation (<a href=\"http://www.tonkohouse.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tonko House</a>). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also love painting and drawing, and this year have started to show as part of gallery shows (Q Pop, Light Grey Art Lab, etc). </span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in 5 or 10 years? Do you think you’ll stay in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professionally, I see myself expanding into different industries (ie. not just tech, but also publishing, editorial, advertising, etc). Personally, I would like to be more established as an artist and find more of my individual voice. I think I’ll continue to work in tech but my priority right now is to maximize my technical ability as an artist. </span></p>\n<p><b>What advice would you give to folks from similar backgrounds who are in tech or hoping to get into it?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s kind of hard for me to answer this question, because everyone’s experiences are so different. Seeking out mentors, aligning yourself with a company that wants to invest in young talent, and trying to figure out ways to reverse engineer projects and skills are very actionable steps that you can take to grow on your own (in the beginning, at least!). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, all I can do is try, and try my best. Sometimes there are things that get in the way that are beyond your control, but I really believe that where there’s a will, there’s a way. That’s something that my parents’ experiences have taught me too; observing their hard work and optimism through their respective paths became a really ingrained lesson from my childhood. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Tell me a bit your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I grew up in Southern California. I have always been very logic oriented, and more than a little bit stubborn. I really don&#8217;t like doing what I&#8217;m told just because I was told to. I grew up doing martial arts and one of the big sayings we had is that when logic and tradition conflict, it&#8217;s time to make a new tradition. It has kind of stuck with me my whole life, and sometimes in the past caused problems with authority figures [laughter]. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are just words I live by. Growing up I was always told that I should pursue a career in law&#8211; encouraged by my teachers and even to a certain extent my family. We had lawyers in the family, everyone knew what that was. Computers weren&#8217;t really a thing or a career at the time, and certainly not prestigious yet. My dad worked in IT and that was like a big cutting edge scary technology thing for a lot of people. It never occurred to me to do anything other than something along the lines of chemistry being a lawyer because those were the things that people really encouraged in me. And so I got into Cornell&#8217;s engineering school as an undecided engineering major, and had a vague idea of maybe going to law school later, but really had no clue what to do. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I took a computer science class, and it was awesome, and I liked it. So I stuck with it for a while. Still didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to do because nobody had given me the idea that I should, &#8220;go be a software engineer for a living.&#8221; That never really happened. And then around my first semester of my sophomore year, I found out there was a games class and I took that, and then more games classes, and at that point I was hooked, and was like, &#8220;Oh my God, why would you do anything else with any of these skill sets?&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was lucky. I went to a an incredible school that had a games program when there weren&#8217;t a lot of games programs, and it fed directly into </span><a href=\"http://www.ea.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EA</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8216;s internship program, which was also really nice.</span></p>\n<p><b>When was the first moment that you knew you were into tech and/or gaming?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t know. I grew up playing video games and I always thought that was just the coolest thing. Then being able to actually make them seemed just all kinds of crazy and fun, and I wanted to do something that I would have fun doing. Of course I had no idea when everyone was like, &#8220;you need to really, really love it to do that,&#8221; because they really had no idea. These are dudes talking, and they really have no clue how hard it is to do what we do.</span></p>\n<p><b>So walk me through that. What was it like first getting into the professional world? And then walk me through your whole trajectory through today.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had a really great female mentor in college, who spent time with me and worked with me on some of my issues and skills with academics, because I was doing really poorly in school. Like not feeling like I fit in. I felt like I was learning, but I didn&#8217;t feel like I was good at school, or doing well. And we had a lot of long conversations about what my hangups were, and she took me to a women in computing celebration, the </span><a href=\"http://ghc.anitaborg.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grace Hopper Conference</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, around our junior or senior year of college. And it was just totally this life-changing experience where everyone was just a little bit more like me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I met a woman from EA before they were hiring interns and talked to her and got my first in with the games industry. Ever since then, I&#8217;ve been really focused on staying in games. I had a great time at EA. I loved it there. I worked at </span><a href=\"https://www.zynga.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zynga</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> later, and was super into it in the very beginning. I joined there in 2009 and it was right after FarmVille launched, so they were just looking for people to help keep the games going, build more games, and keep the servers from catching on fire. I had some amazing mentors there that really helped me grow and develop myself as an engineer and build a little bit of confidence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were also people that smashed it down and it was kind of cyclical there. I would have a really, really good couple of months and then a really, really bad couple of months. Sometimes I’d leave work crying, sometimes I’d leave work super happy and really feeling like I got to actually connect with people and do things that made a difference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of my first projects there was doing a charity feature in FarmVille where you got to buy a special seed to plant and it was for Haiti. We donated over half a million dollars to Haiti and at the time I felt like I was this nothing engineer, who got to be a part of this really cool thing that not only did something great for our players, but helped change the world. It&#8217;s pretty badass. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, there have also been not great moments where I&#8217;ve wanted to leave and quit and not do games anymore, maybe not do tech anymore [laughter]. Lots of situations and lots of decisions that kind of led to where I&#8217;ve been the past couple of years at </span><a href=\"http://www.gsn.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GSN</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where I feel like we&#8217;ve got a much more stable grasp on development than some of the other mobile/web games places. Even though I&#8217;m not working directly on the games themselves anymore, it&#8217;s still nice to be a part of game creation. But just being a part of the gaming experience has still been pretty important for me for some reason. Maybe it&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t like feeling like I shouldn&#8217;t be there [chuckles]. I don&#8217;t know.</span></p>\n<p><b>When did your attention shift from game making to game culture? What was that impetuous?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think it was relatively recently. I went to Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing again this year, and for a while I&#8217;ve been doing women in tech talks at universities and we&#8217;ve been hosting meetups and for women. I think I&#8217;ve been engaging over the past year. I had this wonderful manager who was encouraging me to talk and encouraging me to get involved in things. Before that I was just coasting and still stuck in this mindset of trying to figure out where I fit in or how to maximize my ability to coast. He really helped me carve a niche out for myself and find something that I care about again, which made a huge difference for me because it not only reminded me that I do have a voice, but that I’m not the only person who will benefit from using it. I just haven&#8217;t had that same passion for games that I did in the beginning for a long time. Being able to recapture a similar feeling has been really good for me.</span></p>\n<p><b>I can relate, having to sometimes look in new places to find that feeling. What was your experience like, or what is it like, being a girl in gaming and a girl in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly, it’s about equal parts lonely and empowering. It sucks when you&#8217;re giving a presentation to 18 dudes, 16 of whom are white, wondering why you&#8217;re the only girl in the room or whether you&#8217;re being held accountable for your gender. Not held accountable but “why am I representing all female engineers?” “Because I am the only female in the room and there are 20 men here?&#8221; It&#8217;s tough. It&#8217;s tricky. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like on the more balanced teams that I&#8217;ve been part of, there&#8217;s been so much more collaboration. Whereas when I&#8217;m the only woman in the room, I tend to collaborate less and talk less because I&#8217;m interrupted more or I don&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s worth it to say the same thing that&#8217;s been said over and over again in a different way. Sometimes it&#8217;s scary to say the thing that you don&#8217;t feel like people really want to hear. And I feel like, especially after my time at other places, you&#8217;ve been conditioned to expect to be reprimanded, glossed over, or even laughed at for speaking your mind. To be overlooked, labeled as overly emotional, or too invested. It&#8217;s still scary to speak up, even now, even though you&#8217;re very well-respected and your abilities are very much considered top-notch, but it&#8217;s really hard to internalize anything that&#8217;s not constructive. And usually the only things that are worded constructively are negative.</span></p>\n<p><b>Being isolated in many ways&#8211; where do you go? What are your support groups? Where did you find them at first, and where do you find them now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first I didn&#8217;t really have them in the workplace at all. I had people that I could maybe play board games with after work, or socialize with a little bit In a non-frat, &#8220;non-brogrammer&#8221; way and kind of built on that a little bit. Just finding people I worked with that fit my definition of culture. And I got really lucky. The place I&#8217;m at now has a ton of people that aren&#8217;t super hardcore into drinking and partying and stuff, which makes me feel a lot more comfortable around my coworkers. Past environments were particularly bad at that, because the way I found support would be to drink a lot with people and go out. That&#8217;s what you would do and that&#8217;s how you lived that life. It was just a part of that bubble for a long time. It’s one of those uniquely tech-y startup-y San Francisco expectations, and I went along with it for a long time trying to fit in and be well liked, and because that’s just what people who worked there did. Eventually, the culture really started shifting as the startup vibes went away and the teams got too big to handle. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was very much like this frat that you were either a part of, or you&#8217;re even looked down on as somebody who went home and had kids. It still blows my mind that that was the cultural norm and people talked about it like that. It&#8217;s just this skewed thing that isn’t real life, but because I was young and desperate to fit in with the Silicon Valley brogrammers, that was my world view for longer than I’m proud of [chuckles].</span></p>\n<p><b>Wow. How did that culture affect your female colleagues with kids? Did they stay? How did that affect retention?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a lot of long hours, a lot of attrition. The company skewed very young. So I think for the people who had already started their families and knew how they wanted to live their lives, they had a much easier time drawing the boundaries. A lot of the younger women got sucked into the whole, &#8220;this is how it has to be because this is what 90% of the people are doing and if you want to be cool, you have to be a part of the 90%”. You want people to like you, right?&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was actually really eye-opening for me because after a few years, I was able to develop friendships and camaraderie with people a little bit outside of that bubble and take a second look at myself and realize, “this is how much alcohol I&#8217;m consuming&#8230;this is how much self-destructive behavior I’m engaging in”. I even had really good friends that were in the thick of it with me that kept trying to warn me, and I just couldn’t see it until it was far too late and I&#8217;ve had a few friendships destroyed because of my drinking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I remember that scene in general. You may or may not relate if you want to build a brand. In tech, it’s kind of&#8230;you want to build your personal brand, and so you feel like there is a social path that you must take. It&#8217;s almost like the social path is more important than the work path.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like if I had known that that&#8217;s what I was doing… I didn&#8217;t understand that I was building a brand. I was just really trying hard to fit in and be respected by my peers. I was hearing these things about people that left at 5:30pm everyday and I did not want them saying those things about me. I wanted to be well liked and well respected, for people to want to work with me. For a while I felt like I really was, until I actually looked in at myself from the outside and was like, &#8220;No. This is not what I want to be. I am so much smarter than this.&#8221; It&#8217;s hard to become your own person when you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing, and you’re just doing it because everyone is [laughter].</span></p>\n<p><b>Totally.</b></p>\n<p>After awhile of that, then leaving and getting out of the bubble and really focusing on becoming a healthy, whole person, I feel like it wasn&#8217;t until I was asked to actually say something that I was even comfortable doing that. From there, it just grew. After going to Grace Hopper again this year and getting energized by people who are actually doing some good in the world, a couple of other women at the company were interested in actually forming a professional bond. It&#8217;s a cool experience and really motivating for me to reach out internally and involve the men and the women at the company in the diversity issue. I feel like since then, we&#8217;ve had—maybe not quite as much momentum as we’d like—enough momentum to get people talking and having conversations and wanting to take a second look at job descriptions to make sure that they&#8217;re gender inclusive and little things I&#8217;m hoping will add up.</p>\n<p><b>Tell me more about the diversity issues that you have experienced or seen in gaming specifically. I&#8217;m curious to see the similarities and differences in that specific area versus the rest of tech.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. It&#8217;s a little awkward at first because you hear the way that your co-workers talk about your players and sometimes, there&#8217;s a lack of respect for the players. Especially at some of the younger-skewing companies where you have people talking about the players. I guess it depends on your school of thought, but I always feel like you should have the utmost respect for the people that are paying your salary, but sometimes they can be—and it&#8217;s not generally —insulting. Sometimes it can be a little bit irreverent, but some of the memes that you see posted at some games companies, where it&#8217;s like, &#8220;would grandma understand it?&#8221; it&#8217;s not really necessary. In gaming specifically, I feel like there&#8217;s a lot I had to deal with when I was interviewing as far as culture fit. That specific thing, that term drives me crazy. I can&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s still okay to say.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like that really caused a lot of problems for me early in my career. I honestly thought that I wasn&#8217;t marketable or hire-worthy for a long time, because of just not feeling like I fit in, even though I could answer the technical questions. For a long time it made me question whether I actually should have a seat at the table, because I don&#8217;t fit in. It&#8217;s evolved a little bit, because now the way that I talk about interviewing, and think about interviewing, shows a much firmer grasp of the process. I&#8217;m much more willing to walk away from a bad interviewer, and I can understand what that says about the company. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I feel like, until you&#8217;ve really been in the industry for a while and get to know how the game companies interview, you can&#8217;t tell the difference between a diversity friendly game company and one that isn&#8217;t, because these are things that you just are told are a part of the industry. There&#8217;s this attitude of you&#8217;ve got to really love working games and you&#8217;ve got to fit a certain profile because this is how the industry is and I feel that&#8217;s why so many people have been going indie over the past several years. Nobody wants to work in an industry like that. Especially when it&#8217;s one that claims you need the passion to work there and then exploits that passion and you don&#8217;t even actually get that much influence at a larger company over the things that you care about. Why would you do it?</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you feel all these experiences have changed your priorities and what you want out of a job now?</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now I&#8217;m really focused on two things. I work at a games company that has very reasonable balance in hours and generally cares about its people. We&#8217;re not the best, we&#8217;re not the worse, but we&#8217;re stable. We like each other and we&#8217;re good people. To me that&#8217;s a good enough starting point. We can take what makes us good people that care and do good things together, and foster a more collaborative culture where people like me can speak up. People like our CTO are willing to listen and talk about things like the fact that we only have four female engineers in our US offices, and our C-Staff is empowering us to ask “what can we do about it?”. Those are the types of people that I want to work with and that I want to help me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We&#8217;re focusing more on doing things like meetups where we can actually create that community that we&#8217;re missing. And learning how to function on a level playing field. Things like learning how to negotiate. A bunch of members of our women&#8217;s group in Boston went to a negotiation workshop put on by the city of Boston (because we are a bi-coastal company). And they got a report back to us on all the things that they learned about negotiating. Even just today, there was an intern who got an offer somewhere else and we were telling her, &#8220;this is how you go about negotiating, this is what your tone should be,&#8221; just generally helping each other. That&#8217;s the kind of thing that really sparked something in me at Grace Hopper, because people generally want to lift each other up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s none of all the fakeness you hear about in female-dominated industries versus all of the cut-throatness in male-dominated industries. We&#8217;ve generally seen both sides of the coin as women in tech and we&#8217;re not interested in that, and I think that&#8217;s a really cool thing. Everyone from every company I&#8217;ve been working with has been nothing but supportive and encouraging and wanting to find ways to work together to help. I&#8217;ve been talking with companies like Twitter who want to do networking events and breakfasts and talking and going to meetups at places like </span><a href=\"http://change.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">change.org</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where they discuss using data mining for good. It&#8217;s just incredible how supportive people can be if you let them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it&#8217;s just so hard to find those willing to put themselves out there and speak up. I think one of the things that made it take so long for me was that I feel like, for engineers especially, there&#8217;s this concept of, “you don&#8217;t belong in this engineering culture”, and for gamers especially, there&#8217;s this “girls don&#8217;t belong here” culture. And when you have the two overlapping, it&#8217;s really hard to reach out to either community because there are no engineers or very few engineers in the games advocacy groups, and they&#8217;re talking about a lot of issues that maybe apply less to engineers. Pay equality is a little bit better for engineers, you&#8217;ve got more stable career trajectories, things like that, your work is a little less subjective. It&#8217;s not quite the same. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And you get that same sense of maybe not quite belonging from the tech side too. For example, a woman at Grace Hopper told me, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t work in games no matter if it paid better than software because not only is there this gamergate media presentation, but there&#8217;s also this, &#8216;I want to do some good in the world&#8217; attitude that I feel like a lot of women in tech have.”They&#8217;re here to really make a difference and help, and that&#8217;s kind of what helps keep them going. I kind of feel the same way, but the fact is that games are capable of being this vehicle for change and this binding force for people and culture in so many ways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I keep thinking about my first project at Farmville where we made half a million dollars to build a school in Haiti in a matter of 24 hours. Had it been this gamer-bro dominated attitude leadership of the team, that whole concept and feature never would have happened. There are so many reasons like this that we need more women and minorities in different kinds of games. Because of this attitude and because of the negative media presentation, I feel like it&#8217;s just moving so slowly .</span></p>\n<p><b>So you&#8217;ve started speaking and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re becoming more public every year. It&#8217;s great that it&#8217;s the new way you&#8217;re building your personal brand, but I&#8217;m curious&#8230;I feel like I would be scared shitless as a woman in gaming building her brand, especially working on culture. How do you feel about that? Do you feel almost disincentivized to do well at this? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah&#8211; even if there&#8217;s a carrot there, there&#8217;s going to be a stick there. It&#8217;s scary and it&#8217;s not something that I feel like I should want to do or maybe I should do. But part of where I&#8217;m coming from is that as an engineer, nobody can take away the fact that I&#8217;m a badass engineer. No matter how many 12-year-olds sit behind their computers and try and tear me down, the fact that I write the code I write and that I&#8217;m capable of solving the problems that I&#8217;m capable of solving, and the fact that my track record does speak for itself in many ways, even if it sucked getting to that point and I have a hard time internalizing it sometimes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like—I won the CTO award at Zynga for technical innovation and I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s changed since then, but at the time I believe I was the only female engineer to get one, and the award itself was a pretty big deal, company-wide a lot of consideration went into a bunch of different projects every quarter. So the fact that I can think about problems differently and do these things and have this merit as an engineer, I feel like gives me a unique perspective to reflect on when I feel like I want to question why I’m qualified to speak up. No matter what you say, my credibility isn’t something that can be taken away by anyone but me, and I’m trying so hard to own that and not let myself take it away, which is something that I’ve struggled with a lot over the years. At least from an engineering perspective, I do have the chops to be here. So from that perspective, I think it&#8217;s a little bit safer for me to speak about why I should also feel like I belong here than a lot of my peers for art or for design, especially. I don&#8217;t know how those women do it because I would not be able to deal with not belonging if my credibility and intelligence were called into question or debated frequently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if I lose my job for something I say, I will find somewhere that will want me to be an engineer for them, and I have options. Even when I wrote my first piece that I published, it was like, &#8220;This is only on LinkedIn and I&#8217;m only going to write on LinkedIn because I only want people to tie their professional network to the things they say.&#8221; And a lot of my coworkers said that that was probably the smartest thing I could have done at that point, and I agree. That&#8217;s why I did it. I won&#8217;t write anywhere that I will get anonymous comments if I can help it. I don&#8217;t have a Twitter, I don&#8217;t have a lot of the tools that I think people use in the industry to get jobs and make connections. I feel insecure enough that I think that it&#8217;s for the best.</span></p>\n<p><b>You&#8217;ve touched on this in many ways, but what are the biggest motivators behind your work? What drives you? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t know. I want to help the future me&#8217;s not have what happened to me happen to them. I want corporate game development to become something thing that you can feel safe doing no matter who you are. We have our most diverse developers and most innovative games being developed as indie games. While I think it&#8217;s great that that&#8217;s an option for people who have the drive and passion and all the things that it takes, it shouldn&#8217;t be your only option if you want to feel safe or create games that reflect on who you are. I feel like given how important games are as a medium, as something that so many people touch every day, the fact that the industry is still so skewed really sucks for both developers and players in the long run.</span></p>\n<p><b>In terms of the future, I know you still have a lot enthusiasm for games and you were able to execute on some of that. What are you excited to see in the future? What is the positive potential that you&#8217;d like to see in games?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;d love to see games go full circle and start influencing our culture rather than reflect the worse parts of it. Everyone&#8217;s losing their shit over Star Wars right now because, &#8220;Oh, they finally released a blockbuster movie with a female lead and there&#8217;s a female Jedi, and it&#8217;s just such a huge deal”. I would love to see games make it the norm such that it’s not a big deal. I would love for women and minorities to be relatable characters because then we&#8217;ll be relatable people. Especially growing up, I actively didn&#8217;t really play a lot of the games where you had to play an over-sexualized woman. I never really got into the shooting games. Had they been less geared towards men and marketed towards men, maybe that genre might have held more appeal for me. Maybe it still wouldn&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t know.</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m just personally curious what your favorite games were growing up.</b></p>\n<p>I am and always was super into RPGs. I loved the 7th Saga, I loved Super Mario RPG, I loved Illusion of Gaia, those kinds of games. I also really love&#8211; I&#8217;m kind of an achievement whore and I&#8217;m a collector, so I love doing lots of side quests. Collecting things like Pokemon was the perfect game for me because it&#8217;s literally about catching them all. I love games as a storytelling mechanism for escape, as well as the social component that they bring through local competition or cooperation. I didn&#8217;t really have the best network or childhood, or a lot of friends growing up, but I felt like I was really able to not only escape that but really engage with stories and maybe become a better reader and a better narrative teller because of gaming. I was able to bond with people playing Mario Kart or Wave Racers as a kid and have something I could get excited about and make a connection over.</p>\n<p><b>Totally. Side note: do you remember the Pokemon photography game that came out for N64?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pokemon Snap [laughter]? Yes!</span></p>\n<p><b>How indicative that that was one of my favorite games [laughter] ever. I played that.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was actually just talking about that this weekend. It was so good!</span></p>\n<p><b>I know.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was so good.</span></p>\n<p><b>I would love to see more photography games.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I thought it was just amazing. I mean look at how popular Snapchat and Instagram are. Photography games would&#8230;</span></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s so true. And there&#8217;s not been any &#8211; I mean, I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t follow anymore, but I&#8217;m assuming there have been none.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nothing really good since Pokemon Snap.</span></p>\n<p><b></b><b>How do you think your background and life experiences, everything in-between, impacts the way that you&#8217;ve approached your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a long time I&#8217;d like to really pretend that I didn&#8217;t notice, but later I recognized that my approach to things is a little bit unique. Take my first ever engineering internship in games. I wasn&#8217;t doing very well halfway through. I was trying really hard to figure out what people wanted. I was having a hard time not doing what was expected so much as just what I felt like I should be doing. I was just taking a lot longer to figure out how everything worked together, and I got some feedback halfway through that reflected that, which I found fair. None of the critical things on that feedback really bothered me other than being referred to as a slow learner, because that&#8217;s one thing that I&#8217;m really really not. Maybe I do have this tendency to be over-prepared as a result of wanting to get everything right the first time, but I would not consider myself a slow learner and never have, so I spent the rest of my time proving that one little tidbit wrong, and everything else just kind of fell into place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that from then on it was about like not only proving that I&#8217;m not a slow learner, but I&#8217;m taking a little bit longer to get all the facts straight, communicating that that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing and not that I&#8217;m not understanding and just trying to present competence. It&#8217;s hard to do that when you&#8217;re not very confident of what you&#8217;re doing because you feel like you have to prove that you&#8217;re confident. Over the years, it&#8217;s kind of been stacking a little bit because you have to spend so much energy proving your competence the further you move. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To have to still prove everything from the ground-up is overwhelming at times and it’s something I’ve always struggled with. I&#8217;ve developed this terrible case of imposter syndrome where I have to reason through and prove everything and then I get feedback that I&#8217;m providing way too much context. Figuring out what&#8217;s important to communicate is still a struggle that I think comes from a lot of those experiences. Similarly, being able to take a compliment on my work and take pride in my work is something that has been really hard to develop because of those experiences and because of the lack of constructive, positive feedback. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing I used to do in high school is when I got a really good grade on an essay or something and I didn&#8217;t understand why I did well, I would go after class and ask, &#8221; Why is this good? What did I do well here and how do I do more of it?&#8221; Because sometimes it&#8217;s really easy to get it right, and be happy about getting it right, and not really focus on the why. That&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve been trying to take forward and take advantage of a little bit, because that&#8217;s, I think, a part of what makes me so good at what I do. I&#8217;m very capable and focusing in on why it&#8217;s right as much as why it&#8217;s wrong gives me the ability to replicate good results more frequently, and I think that that&#8217;s true of a lot of women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like women&#8211; because we tend to get that a high level of scrutiny and feel the need to justify it, we tend to focus a lot more on why things are right as well as why things are wrong. A lot of the female engineers that I&#8217;ve worked with have been especially good at explaining not just their code, but other people&#8217;s code or why certain principles are better to follow, or why things were done a certain way. There are a lot of men and women who I’ve admired greatly in many different teams that really focus on why things are good or not so good.</span></p>\n<p><b>I agree.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s not to say that men don&#8217;t do that, but there have been a much higher percentage of women that I&#8217;ve worked with who have done that than men.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do your lady friends in gaming feel about their long-term careers? Are they going to stay?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s a tough one. I&#8217;m not sure. I know that a lot of women have felt pushed out and given up. I have this incredible friend who had just such a rough time at Zynga. She wasn&#8217;t an engineer, she was a product manager, but she&#8217;s such an amazing, powerful, strong woman who no longer cares about games and isn&#8217;t going to do it anymore. And I think that&#8217;s really common, especially in games, especially in light of everything. I can&#8217;t proudly say I work in games the way I used to be able to. I used to be so excited to tell people that I worked on Farmville or that I was working at EA and got to work on a Sims game or whatever. That was a really exciting moment for me, and that joy and that pride in my industry isn’t there anymore. It’s hard to stay passionate and exciting after these big and small experiences add up and you see your female colleagues, friends, and peers go through things that make you want to cry or throw something or just walk away.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yea, if you don&#8217;t love the games anymore, then why stay?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s exactly what it is. I fully recognize that I am far more stubborn than most people should be, and I think the only reason I&#8217;m still here is because I&#8217;m stubborn, and that&#8217;s one character flaw that I will own all the way through, it&#8217;s both good and bad.</span></p>\n<p><b>I feel like I have hope for the positive impact you can have while you&#8217;re there. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve had a moment where just meeting another woman in games is enough to make you feel like you can be in it, you know?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah.</span></p>\n<p><b>And so just your presence is probably more valuable than you realize.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, like I&#8217;ve almost cried when somebody who I&#8217;ve met who&#8217;s a minority or female or trans just shows that passion and still has it. That makes me cry with happiness.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in 5 or 10 years?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s a tough one. I&#8217;m still kind of in this phase where I&#8217;m trying to figure it out. To figure out whether my personal brand and goals are tech related, games related, or diversity related. But I don&#8217;t see leaving tech and still feel a strong draw towards games. I like programming too much to leave. I really love the personal satisfaction I derive from creating good software. I love solving hard problems, and that investigative technical super sleuthing makes me so happy that I don&#8217;t really see leaving tech, but I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m not sure caring this much about games is good for me, but it is the whole reason I developed these programming chops and passion. In a way, it’s still core to who I am.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, that makes sense.</b></p>\n<p>I feel like the balance is not always good and while I really believe in the positive cultural impact that games have, I wonder whether&#8230;if the industry doesn&#8217;t start making the strides that Tech is making&#8230;I mean Tech is so much more grown-up about everything then Games is. And if we&#8217;re not able to be grown-ups and talk about things like adults, then what can we do? I want to have adult conversations and I don&#8217;t want to fight. I want to cooperate and collaborate and I would love to be running an engineering team that really reflects those values. I would love to run a collaborative team where people are supporting each other and solving problems and building things that are exciting to build and working together to do it as opposed to working against each other.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hate the concept of staff rankings. I hate the concept of&#8230; just because somebody&#8217;s not doing well in an environment, it&#8217;s their fault. There are so few environments setting people up to succeed that I see and really mentoring and working with people. I would love to be part of a female mentorship for games, or for tech. Because when I look above me in the org chart there are no women where I am… none. There is nobody in my work that I can connect with and even just have a conversation and say “what made you the person you are that got you here?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s very hard to find that, especially in games coming from someone who is there. You really have to look to tech to find those high achieving female mentors that you can really look at to see&#8230;what did you do right? What did you do wrong? What do you wish you had done differently, and did it make you happy? I used to get asked all the time growing up whenever I would find a loophole to something, whether I would rather be right or happy. That was always such a bullshit question to me because obviously being right makes me happy. The joy comes from finding new ways to be right.  I guess it&#8217;s not a hard line always, but I feel like in tech and in games it seems like a choice still. Maybe in tech it doesn&#8217;t really seem like much of a choice.</span></p>\n<p><b>What advice would you give to an earlier version of yourself? Like girls who are super in love with games and super passionate about it and hoping to get into gaming professionally?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly, I feel like I would tell myself that it&#8217;s okay to focus on being safe, happy, and being unique. It sounds so cheesy, but being your own person and really owning what makes you different as opposed to trying to fit in would&#8217;ve taken me a lot further. I don&#8217;t think I would&#8217;ve been that person putting myself in unsafe or unhealthy situations and not setting myself to succeed and not really understanding why nobody else was setting me up to succeed either. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would watch male colleges get praised for doing less and being given every chance or opportunity, and being set up for success and I assumed that it was me that wasn&#8217;t worthy of being set up. Or that I was being set up to succeed and just doing it wrong. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of feedback I would get on my communication style was that it was very erratic or incompatible with the existing organization. If I could tell myself the science of why it was happening, and help to call out that bullshit as opposed to internalize it, I don&#8217;t know I&#8217;d be the same person, but I would absolutely give that advice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s no reason to hand over your self-worth to a manager who may or may not be fair, objective, or know what he (or she) is doing. And if you doubt your abilities, take a test somewhere. Do a project. Find a more objective way of figuring out if you stack up. And if you don&#8217;t, go back to the basics. There&#8217;s no shame in that. But don&#8217;t hand your self-worth to somebody else because they typically don&#8217;t do good things with it [laughter]. </span></p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s okay to feel like you&#8217;re doing awesome and not get recognized for it. And it&#8217;s okay to feel like you don&#8217;t fit in because that might mean you&#8217;re doing something right.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>So, why don&#8217;t we start from the beginning? Tell me a little bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Early years, I grew up in Africa. Nigeria, to be specific. I mainly grew up in the city, but it&#8217;s not like any traditional American cities as you see here. It&#8217;s definitely a lot more chaotic and not organized at all. Early years, maybe early memories, I guess, I remember every holiday, especially Christmas. We would go back to the village. Everyone would go back to the village. You would convene, spend time with your immediate and your extended family. And the village is exactly that. It is communities in the middle of the forest [laughter]. And that was fun. What else did you ask? [laughter]</span></p>\n<p><b>What was your family like? What did your family expect of you? What did you think you were going to be as a little kid? All of that.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My family&#8217;s super religious. God first. Whenever my dad or mom gives me advice it&#8217;s: “Did you pray?” I grew up in a very religion-oriented family. Sometime between the age of 8 and 12, I kind of drifted away from them. Where I am now, I cannot easily drift in back in to it. I&#8217;m in some kind of weird state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But expectations were you always have to go to college. That&#8217;s expected of all Nigerian kids who have the opportunity to come to the States. My dad wanted me to be an engineer of some kind, or a doctor—you know, all these stereotypical things African parents expect of their kids. For the most part, throughout middle school, I was going to community college, taking engineering classes, robotics classes. I took a bunch of AP courses. I was preparing myself to be an engineer. And then 2009 happens. I&#8217;m taking AP Gov, I have an A plus. Obama&#8217;s big. I&#8217;m like, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Yo, he&#8217;s half black—kinda black. I can do something.”</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> [laughs] And I was like, “You know, Dad, I know you want me to be an engineer, but I&#8217;m just going to do political science.” He was like, “You&#8217;re going to regret that decision. Why are you doing this? Just do mechanical engineering.”  </span></p>\n<p><b>But Obama.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Obama. I got to UCSB, did poli-sci there for a fun four years. And you know, poli-sci for the most part, it&#8217;s absolutely useless. I don&#8217;t recommend that anyone learn it unless you’re doing political philosophy, then it&#8217;s pretty exciting. But anything else is just your own opinion, that&#8217;s basically it. You read other people&#8217;s opinion, then you read another person’s opinion, then you synthesize it and you create your own opinion. And that&#8217;s literally all poli-sci was. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I left to go study abroad for junior year and went to Lyon, France, and it was an amazing year. I learned so much about myself—about my emotional range, just about the kind of life I wanted to live, and the kind of people I want to have around me. I learned, speaking of emotional range, I learned to love, like truly love, and that was great. [laughter] I came back, kind of had a reverse cultural shock, kind of hated everything around me because it wasn&#8217;t exactly what I wanted to live. I was living in Isla Vista.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s basically a one mile by one-mile cesspool of kids between the age of 18 and 24—and there&#8217;s like 30,000 kids there and they&#8217;re just packed on top of each other and it&#8217;s just mayhem. It is just complete mayhem. It&#8217;s fun, it&#8217;s great [laughter]. It could be overwhelming and people spin out of control sometimes, but I definitely recommend it if you&#8217;re between the age of 18 and 22 [laughter]. However, It wasn&#8217;t the world that I wanted to live in. I ended up after college staying an extra year in Santa Barbara, the city. I grew complacent. It was fun. There was beautiful people everywhere. I was young and I was in a city full of young people. Rent in Santa Barbara&#8217;s pretty expensive, but my rent was not. I was paying $475 a month. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The job I was working allowed me to party and what not, but I became complacent. I felt like I was a knife slowly eroding away. I wasn&#8217;t as effective as I could have been, so I decided to leave. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I came up here. I got a job at Yelp—actually EAT24, as they were transitioning to be acquired by Yelp—as a salesman. I was doing sales for them. Hated it. Absolutely hated it. I couldn&#8217;t come to work. I skipped many days of work because just the thought of going to work set my stress levels skyrocketing, spiking. I would come into work and have just knots. Knots, like on my back. I was looking for a window to jump out of as soon as possible. As soon as a window presented itself, I was looking to jump out of it. Not an actual physical window — a figurative window [laughter].</span></p>\n<p><b>A figurative window.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good friend of mine, Beso, who also went to UCSB with me, presented me with that window. He said, “Yo, I&#8217;m working Squaretrade. Come through. We just had a member switch teams so we have an opening.” I applied. Got it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SquareTrade was where I decided to take control of my life—mainly because it was scary how perfect it was. I was doing sales, earning good money to live. But half of the time I wasn&#8217;t actually working because it was inbound sales. I would wait for someone—a call—I&#8217;d close them, and then that was it. I had an option to watch YouTube videos, as my coworkers liked doing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the way, one of the reasons I came up here was to join tech. I didn&#8217;t know exactly what I wanted to do in tech. I just knew I wanted to work in a tech company. I&#8217;d seen engineers. And I thought, “Maybe I should return to that engineering mindset that I know that I&#8217;m capable of doing.” I remember a couple of the robotics classes. We actually programmed the machines. We didn&#8217;t write the actual code, but we used an abstraction of the code to program. </span></p>\n<p>But anyways, so half the time I was working, the other half of the time I didn&#8217;t have anything to do, so I’m like, “Okay, let me learn some Ruby.” I learned some ruby because it was supposed to be the easiest thing to learn. And then I learned some Python. Then I told myself that every single week I would at least go once or twice to a meet up. These meet ups always had food and alcohol, so it kind of reinforced me to keep coming. There&#8217;s always going to be food and alcohol— save like 30 bucks a week on that.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went to this ping pong tournament at MakerSquare and they say, “Just come through and see it.” And I just—I loved the people. They were super nice. And they were like me. They were just nerds, and I was like, “Oh, you guys get it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The highlight of the night was—I forgot her name—but this girl, she was going around just asking questions. Asking brain teasers to people. The scene was judging people’s responses to the brain teasers, getting questions and getting answers and comparing to others. I just felt at home there, so I applied. Didn&#8217;t get in the first time. I applied again. Didn&#8217;t get in the second time. Then I was like, “I guess this is not for me.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then by chance, by luck, this video on YouTube comes up and it&#8217;s called &#8220;The Weird Parts of JavaScript.&#8221; I went, okay. Clicked on it. Three hours of lecture and three hours sitting there learning pure Javascript. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I learned more usable technical skill than I had in four years of college. That three hour video led me to this link on Udemy that was an actual 12 hour lecture. I went through the whole entire thing. I came back for the third interview and blew it away.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I was like, “Do you have more questions? Am I not ready?” I killed the interview. The people loved me. They were like, “Yeah. Come in. You start in six weeks.” I was like, “Okay, let&#8217;s do this.” I went through the entire program. I learned a lot of skills. I was one of the weaker engineers because I&#8217;ve never done this before, but I learned enough tangible skills to be hired, to be considered able, and capable to learn more advanced skills. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program finished mid-October, and then I went through the six weeks process of applying. I applied with Uber, Apple, etc. But Earnest was the company where I felt most at home. I walked in and my first reaction was “Yo, this is sick. You guys are amazing people. You guys actually care about the person.” Then they were like, “Okay this is a person that we want in the company. Yeah, he might not be as technically savvy as this other person. But that other person just doesn&#8217;t know—he&#8217;s not a cultural fit, you know.” And I felt like it was a cultural fit and they felt it was as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We met in the middle and agreed for my company, which is myself. to join their company. Ever since then, it&#8217;s been groovy. I think I could consider myself now no longer a beginner engineer but somewhere in between beginner and intermediate. In two months I’ve learned just that much more. I&#8217;m just a lot more confident in my skills. I can actually troubleshoot something, get it done, and not feel like what I produce wasn&#8217;t sufficient. For one, I don&#8217;t release anything until I am sure it&#8217;s good. And two, I&#8217;m confident anyone else who looks at my code would assess it and give me recommendations on how to make it better. So each iteration is that much better than the last. I feel like the answer went beyond the scope of the question. [chuckles]</span></p>\n<p><b>You&#8217;re doing perfect. What is it about your work that super exciting and activating to you? What little bits and pieces of it are your favorite?</b></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What&#8217;s most exciting is that it&#8217;s all about little tiny puzzles. Puzzles are everything. I love puzzles. I do them on a daily basis. These are little tiny puzzles that you need to solve and once you do that, you unlock the path to the bigger puzzle. You cannot proceed until you have figured out all these little tiny parts.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Given that I&#8217;m a very detail-oriented person, and generally lack the overall skill to see the big picture, I have this sense of, “Okay, I&#8217;m going through this and inspect every single line.” It&#8217;s super fun to know that one, I&#8217;m going to find it eventually, and two, when I do find it, I know that my other teammates would appreciate that I found the solution. It builds their confidence in me as an engineer. That motivates me to keep going. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only that, but given that I&#8217;m in a position where I do not believe that I am the best engineer in my team, it is absolutely amazing to have people who are much better than I, and have me try to catch up to them. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;So, yeah, you&#8217;re much better than I am. But given that I&#8217;m starting at a lower level, any advancement I make, for me, seems a lot bigger than it is for you. You just taught me this little thing you&#8217;ve known for months. With me, that&#8217;s like a difference between saving a whole day&#8217;s work or getting this done right now. Growth. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m in an environment where I&#8217;m literally paid to learn and sometimes also to produce work, but mainly to learn.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> That&#8217;s what&#8217;s most exciting, because I&#8217;ve not ever been in this position before. In college, I was paying to learn very weak skills and now I&#8217;m being paid to learn very technical skills, which is great. </span></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s amazing. Yeah. You can appreciate real learning so much once you find it.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I do.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. I feel the same way about college. It&#8217;s was pretty useless to me. [laughter] It makes you appreciate real learning. Let&#8217;s go deeper into some of the struggles and the roadblocks that you faced, getting to this point.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was my biggest road block, mainly because first, I should have listened to my father, who was trying to give me very good advice. I don&#8217;t regret my decision, because it allowed my life to turn out in a way that was for the best. Just not truly investing in myself is another struggle. I set out goals, and I strive to achieve them, but I don&#8217;t do it in the way that it&#8217;s like, “Okay, you have to really, truly commit to this. If you would really, truly commit to this, you have a much better result.” I half-assed things sometimes, so in that sense, I am my own biggest road block. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, the fact that we live in America, and America is all about competition. Given my current skill sets, I psych myself out all the time. “These guys are way better than me. I can&#8217;t compete with them.” I guess, in that sense, again, I was my own biggest road block. Other than that, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve faced the kind of road blocks that certain people in this society have faced, especially other minorities — minorities that are born and raised here, and have generations of family here. I come from an African mindset. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How my people view the world is: you have yourself, and you cannot blame anything on anyone else. You are the one that&#8217;s controlling your path, to a certain extent, other than God. God has created you and has given me these skills. Now use them, to make something of yourself. It&#8217;s not going to be easy. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, there’s going to be things that you have to overcome. Learning a new language, JavaScript. Learning to think like an engineer, which is different from actually learning a language—it&#8217;s more about architecture and structuring code. Learning to work with people who have a completely different background from you, and could not possibly have the same mindset, given your specific hybrid background. Blockers. Those were my biggest blockers. I was my biggest blocker and I strive each day to protect myself from myself. To de-block these mental roadblocks, these mental obstacles that I&#8217;ve set out for myself. </span></p>\n<p><b>What do you think are your biggest motivators? What do you think drives you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Truthfully speaking, there&#8217;s two main motivators that come to mind right now, not in any particular order. One is that, I have a little brother. I grew up with only sisters for 13 years. I only had sisters. I was actually pretty mad when my youngest sister was a girl. I was like, “Where&#8217;s my brother, mommy? You told me it was going to be a boy.” But I love her. She&#8217;s my favorite sister.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then when my little brother was born, it was amazing. He is a lot more intelligent than I am at his age. He is motivated. He internally motivates himself and he just seeks out knowledge. I know his potential and I want to be in a position in the next two years to help him achieve that potential. My youngest sister—she&#8217;s going to be in college by then, and my parents are pretty old. So I want to take that burden off their shoulders and then he’ll be under my stewardship or my house or whatever. I don&#8217;t know what the term is. But that&#8217;s one of my biggest motivators.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another one is: I love tech, and I love being an engineer. But me as an engineer—I see that as a stepping stone to something else. When I was studying abroad in Lyon, I was at a lycée professionnel. It&#8217;s a system that you have never seen before. These kids go in at age of 12 and come out at the age of 24 learning just one skill. They learn to be very technical, like carpenters, welders—all these different professional skills that our society needs to be industrial. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I was working in their CIEL. It was like the language accelerator program and I was helping the kids who weren&#8217;t so well-versed in English, trying to speak to them in English, trying to get their levels up. I love being in education, but I&#8217;m not very good at it. My English level is poor. There are people who have good control over this language, and you&#8217;re like, “Wow. How did you just construct that sentence?” But I love education, and when I came back, I started working for UCSB mentoring and tutoring kids, underprivileged kids, in Santa Barbara. After that, I was working at EF International, because I was like “Oh, I&#8217;m set on education. I want to do this.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It ended up being that education doesn&#8217;t really pay much, and it was kind of hard to try to live, pay off student loans, save. It was not possible. But what I want to do is return to education. Not only that, but return back to my home country of Nigeria, because right now, the tech boom is happening, but it&#8217;s still pretty slow. It&#8217;s not as fast as is happening in Austin or in San Francisco. But I want to start a school. Not a school, an academy. A coding academy for kids there, because I believe that you can solve so many problems with technology. That&#8217;s why technology is there. It&#8217;s to help make things more efficient to help solve problems. There are bright minds there who have enough aptitude to learn how to program. I want to provide a platform that actually helps them with that. Those are my two biggest motivators: help my brothers, and education in the future.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do your friends and family from home feel about how far you&#8217;ve come?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I definitely think that my parents are very proud of me. There were those two years out of college they were calling me every day worrying, “What are you doing? Do you have enough food? Are you okay?”. But now they call me less because they think I&#8217;m okay, and they know I&#8217;m okay. They believe I&#8217;m okay, which is good. My older sister has been my champion; I wouldn&#8217;t be here if she wasn&#8217;t that motivating voice that bailed me out of a lot of situations emotionally, financially.  She is extremely proud of me. I love that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for the most part—outside of my immediate family—no one in my extended family know that I&#8217;m an engineer. They knew that I was going to school for it, but they don&#8217;t know if I have a job and am working. I kind of want it to do be that way for now. But my friends, they&#8217;re like, “Cool, you&#8217;re an engineer, but in San Francisco, everyone is in tech doing engineering or something.” They&#8217;re like, “It&#8217;s cool.” They&#8217;re not ecstatic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, I think I&#8217;m most proud of myself because I set out a goal, which for a really long time I didn&#8217;t think it could have been meant to be conceived. Then I set out the steps I needed to achieve those goals. Those were the things I could have controlled, and I made sure that I did them. But then there were just other things that I couldn&#8217;t control. By luck, they found a place. There&#8217;s nothing else I can attribute it to. I could not have done anything to influence those things. It just happened to work out, and now I&#8217;m here and I&#8217;m happy because I can only move forward from here. I’ve already only hit rock bottom and this is me building this ladder to get out of rock bottom.</span></p>\n<p><b>Do you have any family in the states right now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. All of my immediate family is in the states.</span></p>\n<p><b>Really?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My three sisters, my brothers and my parents.</span></p>\n<p><b>Nice. When did that move happen?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In &#8217;99. I came here with my two sisters my dad, my mom, my parents. My younger sister and brother were both born here. They’re “American.”</span></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s cool that you have them around. Do you have other support networks in San Francisco?</b></p>\n<p>Yeah. I have a large group of friends. I wouldn’t necessarily say a large group of friends in San Francisco. I think I have a large enough group of friends and a good amount of people that I really like. Jason is one of the best human beings I know. He is just an amazing person, like a brother from another mother. I have a lot of college friends up here and also a good amount of my best friends from high school are actually in the Bay Area. There’s only one or two missing. Three out of the five are here. I am very close with my housemates. I have a large support group here and I’m always looking to expand it out. I&#8217;ve made some cool friends in city that I’ve met here as well, so it’s been good. It&#8217;s really been good.</p>\n<p><b>Do you still go to meetups?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t, because I don&#8217;t have time. [laughter] I don’t have time anymore. But I would love to. Only thing is literally I work—not necessarily odd hours. It’s not set. I come in when I want. I leave when I want. It all depends on how much work I get done. After that, I go to the gym. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started going to a gym because I want to treat my body as a temple, as a company. If you want to have an efficient company, it has to be working on all cylinders—so you need to be healthy physically, mentally, and obviously also financially, so that you don&#8217;t have that stress.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. It&#8217;s different priorities.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, different priorities right now, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that those will not change. I want to first build up a foundation and then start lifting. Lift as you climb, that is the only way you can do it. So many people have lifted me, who am I not do the same as I climb? I think I have done a fair amount of lifting as well. I&#8217;ve definitely helped people. People would&#8217;ve definitely helped me [chuckles].</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you feel about the state of tech? Like Silicon Valley in 2016. What excites you? What frustrates you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do I feel about the state of tech in 2016? I&#8217;ll answer it in many different forms or as multiple forms. The state of tech currently is anxiety. We’re not completely out of this recession and global markets are not doing well at all. So overall market confidence is low and because of that, a lot of tech companies are tightening their belt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might have seen what happened to Tableau, Twitter, Indeed. Given that, I can definitely see how people can be anxious about their position right now. They’re wary of what is going to happen, if their jobs are still safe. Whether this company that I just bought into is actually going to succeed. You buy into their ideology. But you believe, “Okay, this ideology is going to elevate me from my current position in two to three years from now.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The anxiety I think is misplaced. If you are in tech, you got there either through luck, which I don&#8217;t think anyone did, or either through a lot of trial and trepidation. You struggled and hustled to get where you are. Even if you do lose your job, you have a skill and you will bounce back. That kind of lowers my personal anxiety. I’ve already made it once. Even if I do lose this, I can always find it again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On other fronts, I do see how this surge of young amazing talent is changing the dynamics of the city. It is displacing people who have lived here historically for generations. In essence, it sucks. It sucks for them. It sucks because the people who are in tech recognize this but they still come here. This is the price you will have to pay for me to achieve my goal. I&#8217;m going to run you over in order to get to where I need to go. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s a very American thing. You look out for your personal interests first, but it shouldn&#8217;t be that way. We should ideally live in a society that allows the people who are less fortunate to not be displaced while still inviting the best to the city. I guess there are a lot of rent controlled buildings. There’s “projects” that are sponsored by the government. But for the people that don&#8217;t qualify for projects—nor can they actually afford these rent control homes—they’re kind of shit out of luck in the sense that they have to move out of the city, move to north of Marin or Oakland or South City. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Truthfully speaking, I did not want to be one of those people to displace someone. I wanted to live in Oakland where everyone lives in homes and whatnot. It&#8217;s just overall nicer dynamics for me. But I love where I live. I live literally a 15 minute walk from work. And I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d displaced someone. It was an empty apartment, and I moved into it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Macro, it’s good. Overall, I think it’s bringing an actual good to this city, and actual good to the world. When you have people together working towards a goal, whether or not they fail, they’re at least bound together to try to achieve something. And if you do succeed, you would have affected the world, hopefully. Because I believe tech wants to have a positive impact on the world, except for Uber. [chuckles] Hopefully you will have achieved that good that you want to do in the world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earnest wants to help students who are indebted by the system. It wants to help them save money—obviously, still pay it off, but at a much lower interest. I feel like tech wants to do that. Tech wants to make some good, but at the same time, make a profit because it is a business. As long as you have these people who have this certain mindset, it&#8217;s always going to result 51% in some good. Maybe 49% of the time it&#8217;s not. But I’d rather take that 2% difference in possible good than not, if that makes any sense.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you think your background—where you&#8217;re from, how you grew up, and the life experiences that you&#8217;ve had—impact the way that you approach your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I work on the data team, and the team is divided between the engineers, the scientists and the analysts. Engineers mold and move the data. Scientists interpret the data and build models off of it. Analysts visualize data. We are supposed to make sure that the data integrity is clean and matches what we actually expect. However, our attention has pivoted towards keeping the company alive, basically [chuckles]. I think it&#8217;s just certain reports that the company has to create that they didn’t know about four or five months ago. That is basically what my job is mainly focused on—writing code that makes sure that these reports are as close to true as possible. However, given that I’ve been doing this for two months, I’ve pretty much learned as much as I can and I know how to do the report sufficiently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of growth, if I’m no longer growing at expected rate and I’m in a situation where it is too easy, I’m complacent. I had to change that situation, and I saw to it that it happened. I’ve been taking on more responsibility. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve been trying to get better at the skills I already have, because you can always sharpen your knife further.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I can actually also see the light at the end of the tunnel, given that soon we&#8217;ll no longer just focus on these reports. We’ll now be able to actually build out systems that help sanitize data and assure its integrity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My background was I grew up poor. Absolutely poor. I had to scrap for food, for resources, in Africa. We got here because of my mom. Even though we were poor, she always went to school. We have pictures of her when my sister was born. She was in a graduation cap. When I was born, graduation cap. When my younger sister was born, also in a cap. And once she came here, she went back to a community college. That was soon after my brother was born. Now she’s back at Cal State Fullerton. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given that, she was the reason why we were in the States, because my dad applied for a visa. He didn&#8217;t get it. Then she applied for it. She got it because of her merit.</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I see her hustling, always trying to better herself even though she didn’t come from much or have anything. Just having that mindset of thinking, “What would my mom do? She was in this situation.” I know, for sure, she wouldn&#8217;t be complacent.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> She wouldn&#8217;t just sit there and do a repetitive, monotonous thing over and over again. That&#8217;s how my background is influences in my current job. </span></p>\n<p><b>My last question for you would be: what advice would you have for folks from similar backgrounds? Maybe they want to learn to code, but they got a degree that they regretted and they don&#8217;t know where to start. What advice would you have for those folks getting started in tech, or hoping to get into tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> After I finished EF International, I started working at T-Mobile doing sales. The most fun I’ve ever had on a job. If I could do it now, I would, because it was just so much fun. There was this German guy trying to get a cell phone, and I asked, “What do you do?” He&#8217;s like, “I&#8217;m a software engineer.” I was like, “You know, I would love to be a software engineer, do you think it&#8217;s—well the thing is, I didn&#8217;t start when I was young or twelve.” He was like, “What are you talking about, you can start this at any age. It&#8217;s just literally sitting there and learning a new language.” That really really inspired me—“Okay, so it&#8217;s not too late.” </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I didn&#8217;t have to be a 12-year-old savant who naturally dreamed about coding as he was sleeping. I can still do this. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So first advice is, it’s never too late at any age. It’s never too late. I am currently working with a lady—she actually interviewed me, we don&#8217;t work on the same team—she used to be a dancer. A ballerina dancer. That’s what she thought she was going to do for the rest of her life. She thought she would do dance and then she would teach afterwards. Ended up, she got some kind of injury, and couldn&#8217;t really dance anymore. Just bounced from work to work. Then she somehow fell into engineering late in her life, like in her 40’s. She&#8217;s like 60-something right now, working at our company.  She&#8217;s one of the lead engineers at our company. So, first thing&#8217;s first, again: it&#8217;s never too late. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second thing is that—just plan it. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do you want to do? Actually write down this goal. Have it there so it&#8217;s not just a mental model, so it&#8217;s actually a physical representation of what you want to do.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The steps that you have to absolutely do in order to achieve them, then, do those steps [laughter]. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There&#8217;s a third factor to it, another side of that which is the things you don&#8217;t control. It&#8217;s called luck. You can be the hardest working person in the world, the smartest guy. If you don&#8217;t have the luck to put you where you need to be, then it&#8217;s not ever going to happen for you. But the thing is, you have these opportunities that happen all the time. You have to not only be prepared to receive that luck but to be able to recognize it when it’s happening. Prepare beforehand, so when it does happen you&#8217;re like, “Okay, let&#8217;s do it. Let&#8217;s jump through this window and let&#8217;s achieve this goal that we need to achieve.” Be prepared to receive luck.</span></p>\n<p><b>You can engineer luck a bit by making sure you&#8217;re in the position to receive it.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exactly. That was one of the things that a speaker during my graduation said. He said there&#8217;s a lot of luck involved. “I thank all my mentors and advisors, my parents and my wife for being there, but there are just things I couldn&#8217;t control. But I was ready for it. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m standing here now speaking to you guys: because of that.”</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Why don&#8217;t we start at the beginning? Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am originally from Jordan. Born and raised there. Did my undergrad in Management Information Systems. After graduation, I worked at Royal Jordanian Airlines. I worked in the cargo department for about 3 years. The airport is a little far from the capital Amman. In an area that looked more like a desert, and the the cargo building was few kilometers away from the passengers terminals – deeper inside what felt like a desert. The actual building was relatively small. 1 floor that had few meeting rooms, and an open space with cubicles. I don’t think there was more than 30 people there. But that small building was attached to a big hangar where goods and packages were getting onloaded and offloaded to the airplanes.</span></p>\n<p>When I was interviewing, I was told that there will be morning and night shifts, and I’ll be expected to rotate shifts with my male colleagues. I grew up seeing my dad working those shifts, and I always assumed that both men and women work the same shift, so I responded “fair enough”. The interviewers chuckled and said “we’ll see”. It turned out that there weren’t many women worked in Cargo at that time, and at the hangar itself, there was only one woman who worked in the import department. I was assigned to the export department, and I was the first woman to work in that department. Working in that male dominated field came with challenges, and showing up to work as the badass who doesn’t get intimidated by men was the only way to navigate what felt like a hostile environment, and only way to gain respect. but once you get their respect, you become one of them.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess one of the most interesting things about Jordan in general, is that people love and support strong women. There was never laws that prevented women from doing anything just because they’re women. The problem was with the cultural norms that somehow had low expectations of what women could do. But as soon as a woman decides to challenge the norms and proves that she could do it, no one would stop her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was a great experience, and it definitely helped in shaping the person I am now.</span></p>\n<p><b>At that point, did you have any idea that you would end up in Silicon Valley?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not even close. I don&#8217;t think I even knew what Silicon Valley was at that point in my life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I was still working with RJ, I decided that I wanted to do my MBA, so I applied to the best university in country &#8211; University of Jordan, and I got accepted and I started my MBA. I was doing a full-time job and a full-time MBA so it was really hectic, but at the same time it wasn&#8217;t really satisfying. It felt like there was something missing both in my career and education.. I felt like there was something bigger that I needed to do.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So in May 2009 I decided that I don&#8217;t want to register for the second year of the MBA program, and I want to move to the US and get my MBA from there. I started contacting schools in Portland and finally I decided on Portland State University. I decided on that because it felt more like a calculated risk, because I knew if I&#8217;m going to tell my dad that I want to move to the US, I better have a proposal that makes sense, and won’t freak him out! I had to pick a place where he would somehow feel a little more comfortable letting me live there, so I picked Portland- Oregon where I already had 3 uncles and a brother who lived there. I knew it would be an easier discussion. I contacted PSU and started the application and the admission process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">July came and it was the time for the family summer vacation, so I took two months vacation from work and packed one suitcase just like I did every year, but this time I packed all the paperwork that was needed for the school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">July 1st 2009 was the day I came here. The first month passed; my family was here; we were doing all the touristy things we always do. A month later, I got an email from PSU informing me about an orientation session that I needed to attend. That meant I have to talk to my parents and tell them about my plan. It felt more like a confession. I couldn&#8217;t go to PSU by myself. I didn&#8217;t have a driver license, never driven in this country, and I didn’t know anything about the transportation system in Portland. I was a visitor, so I needed someone to actually drop me off at PSU. So I called in my mom and dad, and I was like, &#8220;We need to talk.&#8221; I told them that I applied to PSU, got accepted and I&#8217;m not going back to Jordan. My both parents were surprised but my mom was okay with the idea. My dad wasnt&#8211; he didn&#8217;t really like it for couple of reasons. I guess the first was because I had made a decision and moved on with it without telling him. The second was because he didn’t really understand why I was doing this. For him I was working for a good company. I had already started my MBA, I&#8217;m half way through, so to him I had everything I needed. It took me a week or so to finally get his blessing. I wasn’t worried that he would say no to be honest. I knew that if I explained it to him from an education perspective, he would understand it. And the fact that my uncles and brother were there, made it much, much easier. I also wasn’t that worried because my dad never stopped me from doing the things I wanted to do. He always trusted my choices and decisions, and never tried limiting my options. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, yeah, so I went through the MBA, it was a very cool, interesting experience, I learned Mandarin during that time.</span></p>\n<p><b>Just learned Mandarin, no big deal.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[laughter] I suck at it, trust me. It was not easy and I barely remember any of it now. We had a trip to Asia. We went to Japan, China and South Korea, so it was a really fun program. But given that I was the only Arab, only Muslim, only Hijabi in the program, I had my share of bumps. Something like getting “randomly” selected for extra screening in every airport throughout our trip to Asia, but overall, it was a great experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I graduated in December 2011. My parents came for my graduation. The plan for me was to get my degree then move back home, but I didn’t feel like I was done. After living in the US for few years, I knew that I’ll have much better opportunities here, so I had to go through another hard conversation with my parents about my future. They were staying for couple of months, so we agreed that I have until February to try to find a job here in the US, and if I couldn’t I’ll pack my stuff go back with them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got an offer on the Valentine’s day! The job was in Seattle. My parents had their concerns about that since I’ll have to move to Seattle, and I don’t really have any family that are few minutes away from me, and I’ve never lived that far and on my own before. In Jordan, girls hardly ever live on their own. You move from your parents house to your husband house. There’s nothing in between. Unless you end up in a far university and live in a dorm.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was 28 at that time. I used to joke with my friends that I’m about 10 years late in moving out in the American standards. It was great yet hard experience. It was the first time I ever gas up my own car or do my own laundry! It took me 2 weeks to figure out that I don’t have a washer and dryer in my apartment! I didn’t even understand what it means when the ads say “no washer and dryer in the unit”. I had to call my brother in law to ask him where I can find the washer and dryer, and when I finally found them, I was very surprised that I need quarters to make them work! I had to learn a lot about basic adult life in the US. 🙂</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I lived in Seattle for about a year and a half, then I moved to the Bay Area to start working at Facebook. I started as a contractor, then about a year later I took a full time position.</span></p>\n<p><b>Tell me about your first impressions of Silicon Valley. Did you have any expectations of it based on what you&#8217;d heard, or what stuck out to you when you first came here?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My expectations were mainly about the weather! How sunny it is here compared to Portland and Seattle. It really reminded of the weather in Jordan. Work wise, I didn’t really know what to expect. But soon enough, I realized how competitive it is here. Also, life pace is much faster here. Portland and Seattle are much laid back compared to the Bay Area. Here it feels like everyone is just running the whole entire time. looking for the next big thing and there’s something going on the whole time. </span></p>\n<p><b>What have been some of the most exciting things about working in tech? Like, what are some of your favorite parts of your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly, the huge understanding and the big push for diversity. I did not even understand what diversity really means until I moved here. My whole life I lived in a place where almost everyone looked like me &#8211; dressed up like me; talked the same language., and when I was in Portland and Seattle I guess I just accepted that I’m a foreigner. When I moved to the Bay Area and made it more of my new home, I started becoming more aware of the fact that I am a minority, but being in a company like Facebook, that was a good thing! As a Muslim Hijabi woman; it felt I was accepted and even celebrated for being different. That&#8217;s the biggest thing that keeps me going here.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. I&#8217;m really curious to hear more about what it&#8217;s like being a Muslim Arab-American woman, as you&#8217;ve self described, in tech and just in the US in general. How is that experience been for you so far?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess when it comes to being a Muslim woman there is that expectation -that is usually driven by stereotypes- that you’re oppressed, forced to wear a head scarf or have to cover up. That you don&#8217;t have a voice or a choice. That you’re mainly a follower. Which is the complete opposite of who I am. I’m independent. I wear the scarf because I want to wear the scarf, and in full control of my own life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had some interesting conversations though, things that come from a deep stereotype, something like &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re an Arab. You guys like to kill each other [laughter].Things like this actually happened and I went a through experiences where I did have to educate others, or stand up for myself and fight for my seat in the table. Unfortunately, even here in the US, if you&#8217;re a woman then you&#8217;re an easier target for bullying or harassment. That&#8217;s part of the experience of a Muslim woman in the U.S I guess. Fighting those stereotypes. And sometimes it could be as intense as, &#8221;Oh, you guys like to kill each other?&#8221; Or it could be something as simple as, &#8221;You&#8217;re in the U.S, you get to be free now.&#8221; (as a reaction to my Hijab). But at the same time, there&#8217;s a lot of great people who just are curious. Curious in a very genuine way that they just want to know more. a lot of people who see beyond your look as a woman, and just believe it’s your right to choose how much of your body to show, or cover. So, there&#8217;s the negative and the positive portion of the experience. And I&#8217;ve seen both sides.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where have you found your support networks? You touched on finding groups in college. Where do you find them now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here at Facebook, we have a Muslim group that goes under the umbrella of the Interfaith ERG. So there&#8217;s a really good supportive circle of people who understand where I’m coming from. Throughout the years, I became more and more involved with the ERG. I found it as an outlet for me, because the more I&#8217;m living this Muslim woman experience, the more I am finding myself passionate about talking about it. I realized that you can only change the negative narrative about any issue or topic if you provide an alternative perspective, otherwise people will only have that single story that the media provides, and the ERGs system at Facebook provided this safe environment to do that, and because of that, I can say that now I have a very big network of supportive Muslim and non-Muslim friends. That honestly speaks volumes about the management at Facebook. </span></p>\n<p><b>I love that. My last question for you would be, what advice would you have for folks from similar backgrounds, who are hoping to get to the US, have heard of tech, and want to get into Silicon Valley but feel like it&#8217;s just impossible to make it over here for whatever reason. What advice would you have for them?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would say dare to dream big and you’ll be surprised what life throws at you. Then the second thing is, it takes a lot of work. Even when you make it here things don’t happen on their own. Don’t wait for life doesn&#8217;t happen to you, you have to happen to it. You have to work hard. I worked so damn hard to get through the MBA and get job. Because the culture is different, the religion is different, the language is different, everything is different it was taking me extra time and extra effort to do it. But the harder you work, the more you get, the better things you’ll get. So put more than 200% into it. Pour all your heart and mind and everything in it and it will finally pay back. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last thing is never be afraid to be you. It&#8217;s hard to try to blend in and try to change yourself to fit in, but you don’t have to. Just be who you are. You will always find someone who won’t like that, but that&#8217;s 1 out of hundreds who will like you, accept you for who you are and will stand behind you and support you all the way. So just be comfortable being who you are.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>So let&#8217;s start to start from the beginning. Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born in Argentina and when I was two years old, we immigrated to Canada to this little apartment in the University of Toronto campus and it was really, really cold [chuckles] and there was a ton of snow and I just remember being bundled up in these puffy jackets, me and my brother when we were really young, and my mom who spoke no English and my father who was away at the hospital all the time, and us having to adapt into Canadian culture. That&#8217;s what I remember mostly when we first immigrated. </span></p>\n<p><b>What was your experience as a member of an immigrant family in Canada, like what were the most brutal cultural differences that you experienced?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. I think my parents didn&#8217;t really understand things like sleepovers and Halloween [laughs], so that was kind of, there was some common cultural social things that my parents didn&#8217;t really understand, like trick or treating, you go around and give each other candy, that didn&#8217;t exist in Argentina. For me, the hardest thing, to be honest, was having both my parents be speaking English as a second language, and I just remember going around, because I spoke English as a first language. I also spoke Spanish, but my English became stronger than my Spanish, which was this whole other thing that I can get into. And so, I just remember speaking English fluently like a Canadian, and my parents having strong accents, and me feeling ashamed and embarrassed, and then later on kind of feeling embarrassed that I felt embarrassed, you know? Like how could I be so hard on my parents who were immigrants and worked so hard hard to get us there, and so I definitely think that there was that tension of, I&#8217;m from here but I also don&#8217;t belong here, my parents were a pretty obvious indication of that in a lot of ways.</span></p>\n<p><b>How were early years of socialization for you? Did you feel like you fit in?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I adapted very quickly. Where I started to feel strange was when my parents would speak to us in Spanish and my brother and I would start responding in English, and we refused to speak in Spanish. And my parents tried their hardest to reverse that, like they tried to do all these tricks for us to speak back in Spanish, but we wouldn&#8217;t do it, so I think there was this painful realization that we were losing our culture a little bit, that that was starting to happen in the household. And even as kids we couldn&#8217;t really quite understand what that meant, but I think I still have sadness around that for sure.</span></p>\n<p><b>What did your parents expect of you guys in terms of your career paths or anything like that?</b></p>\n<p>Well, both my parents really value education, because the way that my father was able to leave Argentina was through his medical degree. So because he got an education, he was able to basically leave  for something better, which was the idea or the dream, right? And the way you did that wasn&#8217;t through business or hustling or being an entrepreneur, the way you did that was you went to school and you got the highest possible degree. So I think both my parents expected me to go to school, get a Master&#8217;s and or a PhD if possible a PhD or an MD or a law degree or an engineering degree. Actually, there wasn&#8217;t that much expectation for me to be an engineer; law and medical were the two big ones.</p>\n<p><b>Interesting. Did you have any idea at all that you&#8217;d end up in Silicon Valley tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. I didn&#8217;t think I would be here, I definitely–I had a hunch that I would be in California, and I remember in College, trekking through three feet of snow at 4pm, it&#8217;s pitch dark, I&#8217;m trying to get to class, class is up a hill, and I&#8217;m wearing snow pants, and this is like in Montreal in January and I went to McGill. And I just remember being like, &#8220;One day, I&#8217;m going to live in California.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had this feeling—this very deep feeling—that I would come out West. It was It was an intuition, a knowing. But I didn&#8217;t associate California with technology and innovation. I don&#8217;t know why. I just hadn&#8217;t quite yet made that mental click. I more associated it with free-spiritedness, and hippie vibes, and artistry, and nature which I also love.</span></p>\n<p><b> So walk me through your career, up until the point that it brought you to Silicon Valley.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, I do my undergrad in Psychology at McGill, and then I wanted to understand how research affects people. I was really frustrated that research was very like, in your ivory tower. So I was like, &#8220;How does research actually become policy?&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I moved to DC. And I worked at a health policy organization, sort of doing research for policy, and It was super interesting work. However, it was 9-5 in a cubicle in Washington DC. So I was wearing black blazers and black heels and I just remember looking at myself in the mirror feeling like I was wearing a costume, and being like, &#8220;Oh my God. This is a costume,&#8221; like laughing at myself. It was late on a Friday night and just being like, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get out of here. This isn&#8217;t me. This isn&#8217;t what my soul wants.&#8221; So I quit that job and that&#8217;s when I came out to California. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I decided to continue with the research route, but go into neuroscience. So I got a job at the Stanford medical school scanning people&#8217;s brains while they were being hypnotized. [laughter] It&#8217;s very random, but it was a big hypnosis study, which was funded by this foundation that looks at complementary and alternative medicine. And it was interesting. We would put people in the scanner. We would hypnotize them and we would see—what do their brains do? Now, it sounds really fascinating, right? Like when you hear that you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Wow that sounds amazing,&#8221; except, the problem was was that I was 9-5 crunching data in a windowless room with florescent lights glaring down on my eyebrows. So I was just like, again, conceptually very interesting, the day-to-day sucks. I don&#8217;t want to do this. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I think those were two examples where my curiosity drove me to examine something, but I didn&#8217;t feel in love with the actual getting down to it, the work itself. And also, an example of where the systems itself weren&#8217;t supporting certain kinds of thinking for me, like creativity especially, right. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I actually quit that job and decided to go to Burning Man and that&#8217;s when I had a big shift in my understanding of myself and the world. One shift that I had was how important creativity was to me and how much I had been suppressing that for so many years because I wanted to be practical, because I wanted to make sure I could get money So my father is a doctor, my mother is an artist, so I just was more aligned with father who was the main breadwinner and just thought better to do all that kind of logical stuff, work. But at Burning Man, I was like, oh my God there&#8217;s so much creative energy here inside of me, and I really think the empowerment of women is something I&#8217;ve always been interested in. I&#8217;ve always been a feminist, since I was a little girl just like my mom. The empowerment of women is going to be key in this sort of helping supporting innovation. So I started to focus on women&#8217;s issues after that experience. And from there, I basically went to India and worked with women in the sex trade there.</span></p>\n<p><b>How did that happen?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I met this RISD alumni, who started this whole organization around women in the sex trade in India, and helping them get out of the sex trade by providing them alternative work. I got very interested in that and I thought, &#8220;Hmm. I want to go do what that woman is doing.&#8221; It turned out that the woman at that organization—the founder was very young but she got sick, and they were like, &#8220;We don&#8217;t have anyone to go to India.&#8221; They were a very small organization. &#8220;Could you go?&#8221; Because I was in conversation with them. &#8220;Great. I&#8217;ll go.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I just remember going to India by myself—my mother being terrified for me—and [chuckles] arriving in Rajasthan at this little town Ajmir and feeling like, &#8220;Wow.&#8221; I was in an HIV clinic center, didn&#8217;t speak the language, was basically in pretty impoverished area, having to connect with these women. These women who were living in the slums or the red light district, and trying to have better lives for their kids, and for their daughters and their sons. That was a trip.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think what I really learned there was how much the women stuck together, and how much they formed a sisterhood and how much they ate together and walked together and travelled together, and how much they really supported each other, and I thought wow, us Western women, we don&#8217;t do that that often, we don&#8217;t have that sense of sisterhood that comes so naturally to them in their culture. And so I really admired that so much and that really stuck with me from that experience.</span></p>\n<p><b>So how did this impetus for wanting to switch your focus to women, what were the first steps to making something out of that? Like what did you want that work to look like?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that&#8217;s what a lot of us grapple with. We understand our why or we get an ah-ha, an insight about our why. Oh, my purpose, I got it, it&#8217;s to support and empower women. But we don&#8217;t understand the how, right? Like, okay, what does that mean? [laugh] </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So after I went to India and I explored that, I came back and I felt that I still was lacking a few tools. In parallel to all this career navigation, I completed three yoga teacher trainings, so I got very very into yoga and its tradition, and was teaching breathing and stress relief courses through the Stanford Medical School.  As you can tell, I&#8217;m a very multi-passionate person, I had so many interests. Research, health and wellness, creativity, women’s issues, it was just so many things. And so our society tells you you have to pick, what&#8217;s the one thing you&#8217;re going to do? What are you going to specialize in? I kind of felt like, how do I take these threads that are different and create a tapestry that&#8217;s my own, right? How do I integrate the threads with the shift that I had? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I went to grad school. I went to a program at Stanford called Learning Design and Technology. I did this pretty intense one-year program where I immersed myself in everything having to do with design. You know, how do we design experiences for people? How do we think like designers? How do we operate like designers? And then, I became obsessed with design [laughter]. It&#8217;s like, another interest to add to the bucket, right? Design started to be a big pillar for me. Yoga was a really big pillar. Women&#8217;s issues was a really big pillar. And then, design was emerging like, third pillar. So I was like, &#8220;Okay, how do I integrate this?&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And so after I graduated, I had two options—I could go back to being a full-time employee in the way that I had described with my first two jobs, right, 9-to-5, being under someone else&#8217;s paycheck, that possibility was there. You could be a designer at X place, you could be a researcher at Y place. But I still felt so passionate about women&#8217;s issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, I totally changed my mentality and thought of it as a design challenge. I was like, &#8220;How can I create value for people?&#8221; Which is the essential question behind business. As a yoga and meditation teacher, I loved mentoring, facilitating, coaching others. So the natural next step for me was to just start coaching women and supporting them in their own empowerment and to see yoga and design as tools that feed that bigger purpose. </span></p>\n<p><em>Now, which women was I going to support? I decided to focus on women in design and tech, and I particularly am passionate about this issue. How can we both empower women to have more creative confidence, but also change the culture in the systems that keep women playing small?</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So now, that&#8217;s really been my focuses in the greater, &#8220;Why?&#8221; of empowering women.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is this focus on women here in Silicon Valley and this world of innovation. For example, I coached one woman who was a sexual assault survivor and was working for a pharmaceutical company, feeling like her career was meaningless. Through our work together, we realized that she has so much to give in supporting other survivors and now she’s the lead PM on a tool that helps people report sexual assault on college campuses. That’s what happens when you empower one gifted woman: ripple effects. </span></p>\n<p><em>I believe so deeply in my heart, that what we&#8217;re doing here in Silicon Valley is creating the future. We&#8217;re creating the future. And so it&#8217;s like, if women are underrepresented in that creation, we&#8217;re going to have a hypermasculinized set of products and experiences. It&#8217;s not going to serve us. It&#8217;s going to continue to perpetuate the same system that&#8217;s keeping all of us oppressed<b>.</b></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So, that&#8217;s my spiel [chuckles].</span></p>\n<p><b>What were the big contributors to you knowing tech was what you wanted to focus on? Was it your experience at Stanford? Was it just observation of the Valley? What was it that made you know that there was work to be done here?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was at the Stanford Medical School, I discovered entrepreneurship [chuckles]. I was in my little lab, nine to five, but I was at Stanford and I was looking around at the beautiful buildings, and the ideas and there were so many resources. So, I went to so many talks around entrepreneurship and innovation, and the VC world. That&#8217;s where I met my now, fiancé, Enrique Allen, so it was like I became very immersed in the ethos and energy of what&#8217;s possible for us to do in the tech world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I did that migration from Washington, D.C. to working at the medical school, that was when I really started to notice, wow, there&#8217;s something about how people here see the world and see how they can solve problems for the world. Even in Washington, D.C. which is where our politicians are, but there wasn&#8217;t this sense of like, we can innovate, we can really create new solutions, we can listen deeply to people and help serve them. It&#8217;s just a different ethos. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During my Masters at Stanford, I did several projects where I looked at gender differences and STEM fields. That was one big project that I actually did in my child development and technology studies class. I did a lot of research that suggests that girls score lower on spatial reasoning than boys, and it’s because boys just play video games, and video games allow them to have more spacial acumen. And spacial acumen is a big predictor of your success in STEM fields. I started to get really interested in video games for girls [chuckles]. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;How do we create video games for girls?&#8221; I just really feel that, there&#8217;s a really interesting intersection between being a woman today and your creativity that I&#8217;m still exploring and understanding because as women, we are givers of life, and so much of the creative process is bringing something to life. So I think I&#8217;m still exploring this, but I think the intersection between creativity and gender is something that I&#8217;m really, really interested in.</span></p>\n<p><b>Based on the conversations you&#8217;ve had with your clients—obviously, keep things confidential. But from a high level, what have been the biggest hardships you&#8217;ve seen for women in tech?</b></p>\n<p><em>I think there is a few things happening, and I divide it into two broad categories. One is how the culture—the systemic issues—aren&#8217;t supporting women. And these are actually more cultural. So like, events and experiences are designed by men, and subconsciously, non-intentionally exclude women in various ways. The unconscious biases that are happening with the women gets excluded or somehow reminded that they are the minority, so that&#8217;s a big thing. That’s causing women to drop out of the system before 30—not because of motherhood and child rearing, but because hyper-masculinized work cultures can’t truly support them holistically. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is coinciding with the boom of women-lad and women-owned small businesses—consultants and firms that are part of the Silicon Valley ecosystem, but maybe not at the center the way high-growth startups and venture capital are.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second category is how women hold themselves back. Now, some people don&#8217;t like it when we talk about women holding themselves back—they get huffy and puffy about this, and they say, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re blaming women again.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, wait a second. We also have to take responsibility, yes.&#8221; </span><em>There are major systemic and cultural biases, and there&#8217;s also how we, women, without even realizing it are self-sabotaging, are not giving our opinion, are not believing in ourselves, maybe having low self efficacy, or not having that creative confidence to generate, or to be prolific, or to just try stuff out, and be experimental. So, that&#8217;s where I support my clients. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s like, how are you thinking too narrow? How are you thinking too much inside the box? You&#8217;re not being experimental. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One big thing for women, the clients I work with, is—and believe it or not—around fear of criticism and praise. Am I going to get criticized for this? What if I make a mistake? What if they don&#8217;t like me? Right? That kind of stuff. The other is a huge, huge problem that I come into is boundaries. How to say no [laughter]. How to say no in a way that feels good to you. So much of that is having your own structures in place, and knowing what you want. When you know what and when you have your structures in place, it becomes easy to say no, because you just say, &#8220;Sorry, two to five, I don&#8217;t take meetings.&#8221; It becomes just the way it is. So, I think supporting women and that kind of mentality of, what do you want and stake it in the ground own it, protect it, that kind of work.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are the personal struggles and the roadblocks you’ve had to overcome?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh man [chuckles]. In what specifically personal struggles and what area of life about that?</span></p>\n<p><b>I don&#8217;t know. It could be related to just self actualization. It could be related to identity, confidence, work. I&#8217;m particularly interested in your upbringing, having immigrant parents, and being a woman.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. Oh God yeah. I think, in terms of my upbringing, </span><em>the personal challenge I&#8217;ve definitely had to face is not feeling like I belong anywhere. Besides feeling lack of belongingness. That&#8217;s actually one of the most intense feelings for a human. Because we&#8217;re so tribal, to feel like we don&#8217;t belong anywhere is really intense. </em></p>\n<p>I remember just growing up, and my parents—God bless them—put me in school with kids from a low—income community in Montreal. I was an immigrant, but my father was doing well. I was living in the rich part of town, and there was more complication. I&#8217;m hispanic but I&#8217;m white, so who am I? I’m a white Hispanic with immigrant parents? Didn’t feel quite right, either. It&#8217;s complicated [chuckles].</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, I went to this school and I just remember being bullied as the perfect white girl (even though I’m Hispanic), who came from the rich part of town, which is hilarious because my father came from nothing, and we were immigrants. So, there was a misunderstanding, too. I remember feeling, yes, </span><em>I was bullied. That was really intense when I was thirteen, fourteen which is such a precious time, when you&#8217;re a girl. That&#8217;s the time where you build so much of your sense of how you relate to people and you relate in groups, and I think that really challenged me in social situations, feeling like I don&#8217;t always belong with groups. I don&#8217;t do so well groups that much. I always get weary about them [chuckles], whether their groups of women or groups of men, or mixed. I don&#8217;t like to go to a lot of parties. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m kind of an introvert, but I also think being bullied  has something to do with it. I&#8217;m mortified of the idea of being excluded or somehow cast away, so I think that that&#8217;s been a personal challenge for me. Maybe that’s why I’m a solopreneur and run my own business. I&#8217;ve had pretty great solid family upbringing, so I&#8217;ve been blessed in that way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I had a lot of challenges with men, yes. So, my romantic relationships were really, really messed up, like a lot of them. So, I don&#8217;t know what happened because I came from a good family. I was a good girl, good heart, good intention and I ended up with these kind of jerks. The first guy I dated ended up cheating on me. I was in high school. It was my first love. That was really heart wrenching. Second guy I dated in college, cheated on me. It was a totally bad influence. [chuckles] Can&#8217;t believe I dated him. That was pretty low point when I dated that guy in college, where I was in this very dark place, like almost in a depression. I became estranged from my parents. I became estranged from my culture, under some kind of spell. Why? Because he was cool, quote unquote, and I wanted to be cool. I wanted to fit in. I think that was a big thing. I wanted to fit in and I wanted to be cool—that kind of got me in trouble in a lot of ways. But I&#8217;m really grateful for that experience because that kind of spun me on to my spiritual path. From that, I discovered yoga and I discovered a lot of my own self-worth, and it kind of spun me out of that dark time and that&#8217;s when I ended up in D. C. and then ended up at Stanford.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you think your background and the culmination of your life experiences impact the way that you approach your work now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m very adaptable because we moved to so many cities. By the time I was in college I had been to roughly 12 different schools.</span></p>\n<p><b>Wow.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And every school I had been to I had to be the new girl again. I was always the new girl. Then two years later we moved to another house, another school. So my dad&#8217;s job always kept us on our toes. So I think that forced me to be very adaptable and a fast learner. I had to learn quickly, because when you&#8217;re immersed in a new environment, you have to learn the new social skills, the new norms, the new culture of that new classroom, of that new teacher. So I ended up picking up things very quickly and learning very quickly and I think that&#8217;s allowed me to be—as an entrepreneur, as a woman who owns my own business, allows me to be very quick on my toes, allows me to adapt to any situation. So, I am so grateful for that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that my father being a scientist, my mother being an artist, has deeply affected me. Has deeply affected me and my love for design and my love for using design as a tool to support people in their lives—in design thinking, especially. I think I&#8217;ve always been a seeker. I&#8217;ve always been one who&#8217;s seeking truth, and so I&#8217;ve gone on many adventures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m obsessed with The Heroine&#8217;s Journey. I am starting podcast called Heroine, because I&#8217;m so obsessed with The Heroine&#8217;s Journey. Because, I&#8217;ve been on several of my own. I went to Burning Man—that felt like a journey. I went to India—that was a journey. All of it&#8217;s been a journey. But all these journeys have really allowed me to have that self-discovery, and look within about my truth and what my desires are, and let go of the expectations and the noise from the outside world of what I should be doing, and what the &#8220;should&#8217; path is, and really focus on my desire. I think that journey allows you to do that, but you have to take the journey. If you don&#8217;t take the journey, and sitting at home and you&#8217;re scared shitless, and you&#8217;re not really going to be able to tap into that truth. All those journeys were outside of school and work. They were journeys that I took when I was meandering, when I was on sabbatical, when i was travelling and I think when i was in those in-between periods. When I was just following  my heart and interests. I think that&#8217;s what makes a good journey. </span></p>\n<p><b>Speaking of—tell me about your new podcast.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s called Heroine and it&#8217;s focused on women who are interested in design, tech, arts and business. These are women who have taken risks. They&#8217;ve taken creative risks. They&#8217;re creatives, and they&#8217;ve gone on journeys [chuckle].  It&#8217;s an opportunity for me to learn about their journeys, and also to steal their wisdom for other women who want to learn and grow . It also, in my mind a way to show how all these heroines that we so glorify and put on pedestals  are very normal ordinary people just like we are and that are listeners. We can be the heroine if we take the journey. So it&#8217;s about meeting halfway and knowing that as women, as sisters, all of us, we&#8217;re all figuring it out together. It&#8217;s messy. It&#8217;s long. There&#8217;s no such thing as overnight success, and it&#8217;s really like the creative process. It&#8217;s about going into the unknown and seeing what happens.</span></p>\n<p><b>What do you think are the biggest motivators behind your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My God. I have to be honest. I&#8217;m motivated by two things. One is my desire to survive. Like my desire to see that I&#8217;m self-sufficient.  That I&#8217;m financially independent.  That I feel strong. That my sense of providing for myself feels solid. So that&#8217;s a big motivator and I think a lot of us can relate to that. The other motivator for me is my desire to serve, my desire to really see other women step into their leadership, into their power, into their fullest expression of themselves without fear. So that&#8217;s what really motivates me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why does that motivate me? It&#8217;s because </span><em>I really do believe that we need women co-creating the future alongside men, so we can create a world we want and that our voices and our opinions and our touch and our style, and everything that we are as women is—our hand is in it, you know? It&#8217;s shown in the art piece that is the future. That you can look at the future and say, &#8220;Wow, yeah, we see women&#8217;s contributions. We see their voices.&#8221; Because I really feel like otherwise things will continue to be imbalanced. We&#8217;re going to continue to have a slant towards greed, individualism, competition, materialism. We&#8217;re going to continue to have a slant toward those things unless women are represented [chuckles].</em></p>\n<p><b>How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? What excites you, what frustrates you, what would you like to see change?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think there is a movement towards convenience and efficiency in new tech products. Like convenience products, move toward—like now you can order your Sprig and you can order an Uber. There&#8217;s a trend towards that and as an entrepreneur, I&#8217;m so appreciative because it frees up a lot of my time to do what I consider to be deeper, more important work. </span></p>\n<p><em>At the same time, I&#8217;m weary and questioning the power that tech has to shape our lives, and the people who are creating them, are they fully aware of that power. Suddenly now, the way I do transportation is differently. Suddenly now, the way I eat is differently. So, I think there has to be- I almost want philosophers at every [laughter] tech company. People who are deeply thinking about this, whether they&#8217;re anthropologists, philosophers, people who are asking questions, asking why. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People who understand culture—that&#8217;s who we need, also, developing tech products. If you don&#8217;t understand culture and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool? I&#8217;m like a 22 year old dude and wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if you could do that?&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, wait a second before you release that out into the world and potentially change all of our lives and how we function. Having some understanding of culture is really key, that kind of depth and understanding. </span></p>\n<p><em>To relate to that, diversity and teams. So we know diverse teams perform better. They have better financial outcomes. They&#8217;re quote-unquote smarter, more emotionally intelligent. Both gender diverse, racial, ethnic diversity, and they produce more innovation. However there&#8217;s a setback to diversity. It&#8217;s a little slower to get off the ground because when you have diverse people, communication&#8217;s not as smooth because people have different experiences. There&#8217;s an upfront cost to having diverse teams, but I think that&#8217;s the way to go. Like I was saying, when you have diverse teams, you may have more thoughtful products, thoughtful and considered products so that we can really improve our lives and well-being, but it&#8217;s not just about efficiency and convenience. It&#8217;s about something a little bit deeper too</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, I hope.</span></p>\n<p><b>Based on what you&#8217;ve observed in your work, how do you think tech could become more accommodating to women without us having to become more man-like?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, this is going to sound radical but I&#8217;m going to say it [laughter]. Are you excited?</span></p>\n<p><b>Yes.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s going to be radical to both men, but also radical to feminists. Feminists might disagree with me so that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m saying it. We women have different biological needs. So, one is just sheer biology and our relationship to nature, and our relationship to our own bodies that are different than men. We have different cycles than men. We have different hormonal cycles. So, there is something around the way the work day, week, and month  are structured, that isn&#8217;t honoring how women’s bodies. I think there&#8217;s an interesting thing around, how do we build cultures that support women&#8217;s cycles and bodies.There&#8217;s something around just acknowledging it as a fact, and having open discussions around it, and being like, &#8220;Well, how does that affect you?&#8221; And the reason I&#8217;m saying this, is because as hormones are so tied to emotions and stress, which in turn, are so tied to productivity. So, if you&#8217;re going to ignore hormones, but expect a line of high productive output, there&#8217;s a disconnect. So, that&#8217;s one thing companies that are mindful enough just to have open dialogues and conversations with women about their bodies, and their bodily needs, and what they need. And then there&#8217;s point where you have fertility, and then you want to be a mother, and that&#8217;s a whole other issue around pregnancy and your body&#8217;s needs around that, you know.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So that&#8217;s one way that I think that tech companies and culture can be more accommodating to women, and there&#8217;s a lot of space for that especially startups because if it&#8217;s your startup, you have an opportunity to start a culture from scratch. What a unique opportunity for you to set precedence around how the work week runs—you could run your company how you want.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So like, having open dialogue with women and what their needs are, and not having them feel ashamed or embarrassed about that is important. The other is providing leadership development for women within companies. We&#8217;re either referring them to leadership coaches, or helping them in-house with leadership training and development so that they are able to find their own leadership style that they will often take and not feel like I have to be more like a  man. </span></p>\n<p><b>What do you think you will be doing in five or ten years?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wow. These are such great questions [chuckles]. Fantastic questions. Five to ten years? Oh my God. I think I&#8217;m going to be loving life. I feel like in five years life is going to be good. I would really like to have by then published a book, whether is non fiction or fiction. I really want to be writing. I love to write. I&#8217;ve been writing since I was a little girl. I love writing poetry, I love writing fiction. I love blogging, and sharing my voice. I would really hope that by then I&#8217;d have finished either collection of short stories, or published a novel, done my own creative expression work. That would be fantastic. Probably be a mama [chuckle], and navigating that being having a baby, and being a wife building a family, I really would love to live in an intentional community. The beautiful piece of land somewhere that&#8217;s close to the city, I think that would be really cool. Yeah, that&#8217;s the dream.</span></p>\n<p><b>My last question for you would be, what advice do you have for young women who are hoping to break it into this industry and excel, but don&#8217;t know where to start and don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s possible?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like the thing with a lot of women that I work with who have done really well in school,  even if they didn&#8217;t do well in school is that they love to follow rules [chuckles], and so the rule book would say, &#8221; Oh you want to break into tech? Okay. Get your resumé ready, get your cover letter ready, submit an application, right? Because that&#8217;s how you do it. Get introduced to someone, get&#8221;—and I would say, &#8220;No, no, no.[chuckle]. How about you do something outside the box? How about you provide value to a company you want to work with today? What something you could do for a company today to provide value for them without even having to be asked? Take an initiative, go do something for them. Even if it&#8217;s a little research you do for them or a little logo, or you do a little photography portraits of their people. </span><em>Get involved, add value, do the work even before you&#8217;re even hired to do the work. Just pretend they hired you.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We think “I can only do this if I first do this. Well, can I get away with that? Can I do that? Am I allowed to?” Yes, you&#8217;re allowed to. You know what I mean? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go try it out see what happens. Put yourself out there. Do some free work for some people just to get your wheels churning. And also, for you to see whether you like it. In design thinking we call this prototyping. Go try test it out. Right? Instead of like putting all your life savings into this plan, find out whether this is something you even like in the first place. Explore!</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

I&#8217;m the CEO and cofounder of Context Engines, a stealth startup that aims to help people get more control of their digital lives. Previously I was CEO of Catch.com, which I sold to Apple, and SugarSync, where I grew the business from 0 revenue and 13 people to $25M in revenue and an international team of 75 employees and 40 contractors. Prior to that I have been an exec in sales and marketing at Check Point, Yahoo and Netscape.</p>\n</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>I would like to start from the early years and where you come from. Can you tell me a bit about that?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m from New York. I was born in Brooklyn, and lived there until grade school then my parents moved to the suburbs. I grew up in a suburb called Great Neck, which is a predominantly jewish suburb.  Lots of doctors, lawyers and business people – the proverbial golden ghetto. I went to a good high school, and my family really focused on academics. Music was a big part of my life—I studied music very seriously and thought about going to a conservatory but I didn&#8217;t love it enough to only do music. I&#8217;m the oldest of four children. Both my parents are doctors. Interestingly my mother always worked, as did my mother-in-law, actually, my grandmother also worked outside the home as a teacher.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went to Dartmouth and majored in Government. My career goal was to be a diplomat or work for the World Bank or IMF.  After Dartmouth I got my master&#8217;s at Georgetown in International Relations and took the Foreign Service Exam, so I was on that path. I worked for the Agency for International Development when I was at Georgetown and realized that I wasn&#8217;t suited towards working for the government so I switched gears and went to get my MBA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Backtracking bit on the personal side, my husband and I both went to Dartmouth. We met on a Government department foreign study program. We got married right when we graduated from college which I suppose is a little bit unusual. In fact I was 20 when we got married. Steve worked in DC while I went to Georgetown and then we both went to Harvard Business School together. My oldest son was born while I was at Georgetown, also a little unusual for my generation. </span><em>I always knew I wanted to have children and I didn&#8217;t particularly want to wait, and just assumed I&#8217;d work while I had my children so we started our family young. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My oldest son went to Harvard Business School daycare and I got pregnant with my second son when we were in business school.  We decided after graduating from business school that we&#8217;d come to the bay area because he was from California and I wanted to work in tech so we moved out to the bay area in &#8217;88. I&#8217;ve been working in Silicon Valley since then. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My first job was at Informix—a database company—competitor to Oracle. I was there six years—four years in marketing, then two years in Latin American sales. I’ll come back to that as it’s—probably one of the more interesting things I did. Then I worked for another database company called Gupta, then consulted for a little while and then joined Netscape post-IPO, that was 97. I was at Netscape for six years, ended up running the browser division for the last two years there. I joined before the AOL merger and stayed through the AOL and Time Warner merger craziness. When AOL decided to get out of the browser business, I left. That was ‘03. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went to Yahoo where I ran Yahoo Mail, was at Yahoo for a year—and Yahoo was getting very big and bureaucratic.  I thought I want to try a startup and I went to this little company called Metalincs that did e-mail analytics. I was their VP of marketing, launched the product and we got bought by Seagate.  I went to work at Check Point where I ran their consumer business and was VP of marketing. Check Point is one of the major security technology companies.  I realized that I&#8217;ve run businesses several times and was actually ready to run a company.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I joined SugarSync at the end of 2008—right when the market was collapsing. SugarSync was really a great concept and the founders had tremendous vision, but the company at that point was in crisis – the debt holders had taken over and they had run out of money.  I came in and did a restart. The company had had no revenue at that point and was down to 13 people.  I grew the business from there about 75 people and a 20-million-dollar run rate over 4 years.  We had millions of users and terrific reviews.  We had multiple offers to buy it up to nine figures.  The board didn&#8217;t want to sell so we agreed to disagree and I left.  Later in 2013 I joined a company called Catch.com as CEO.  I later sold that company to Apple.  I had twice joined existing start-ups and thought if I&#8217;m going to do this start-up thing again, it would be better to start my own. I started researching some different start-up ideas I was interested in, did a little bit of consulting—I needed the right product and the right people, and those two things came together about a year-and-a-half ago and we started Context Engines.  We&#8217;re now beginning to test our product with the earliest users, and hopefully we&#8217;ll launch it in a couple months.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back to the personal side, I have three other children that were born here in California. I was pregnant with my second son in business school, but he was born at Stanford. My kids are 20 through 30. My oldest son lives nearby, they have a three-year-old and they&#8217;re expecting a baby girl in March. It&#8217;s coming full circle and I’m so enjoying being a grandmother.</span></p>\n<p><b>I mean, gosh, you&#8217;ve walked me through a very extensive impressive career really quickly, but kind of digging into that specifically, of all the things that you&#8217;ve accomplished, between is saving companies, building companies, selling companies, what have been the proudest accomplishments of your career?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, I&#8217;m very proud of what I built at SugarSync. I took a company that was on the brink and built a pretty substantial business. Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t get to exit it so while I’m proud of what I did these things are evaluated by the end outcome and the CEO after me was not able to grow the business and sold for a modest amount. I’m extremely proud of the work I did at Catch—I achieved a really excellent outcome for the investors in just six months.  On the product side I’m very proud of the work I did at Netscape. I was promoted to VP right after Netscape 6.0 shipped. Netscape 6.0 was a pretty bad product—I pulled the team together over the following six months and shipped Netscape 6.1 which was a good product. I look back over a lot of different products I&#8217;ve worked on that I&#8217;m proud Netscape 4.5,  6.1 and 7, Yahoo Mail, Metalincs. And then I’m very proud of the teams I&#8217;ve built. I&#8217;m fundamentally a people person, so I really love that part of the role. </span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;d love to hear how fundraising and building a business was while raising multiple children.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&#8217;s see. Where do I start? </span><em>When I interviewed for the SugarSync CEO role, my youngest son was 12. I didn&#8217;t have babies at home. And in fact when I interviewed for the position, one of the board members actually asked me, “how are you going to do this job while you have children?&#8221;</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  I’m not sure how it would have worked to do the startup CEO role when my children were small. </span><em>I had very big jobs while I had babies—I had a VP job at Netscape managing a team of 220 people, but I didn’t have the stress of being CEO. But I have always felt like having the experiences of being a parent gave me confidence. It gave me a sense of maturity, a way to deal with people. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I do believe fundraising can be tricky for women.  I think actually the irony is a lot of the investors want to be open to women CEO’s&#8211; they don&#8217;t want to be biased. They think of themselves of liberal, even-handed people yet they&#8217;re just not used to women CEOs. When they do the classic pattern-matching, women don&#8217;t fit the pattern. So I do think it is challenging for women. That being said, it comes down to having a compelling business, having a compelling story and pounding the pavement. Bottom line I was able to raise money—multiple rounds. I see other women raising money despite the extra challenge.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are some of the other challenges that you faced?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, child care was always a challenge. Generally I was not conflicted about, &#8220;Do I want to work?&#8221; I liked working. I wanted to work, but if our nanny quit, I was the one typically who would stress out. My husband somehow rolled with it—it didn&#8217;t get to him as much. I think with those things women tend to be the ones who are where the rubber meets the road. Childcare is really hard. It&#8217;s expensive. When you&#8217;re early on in your career, the expenses is pretty significant, and finding someone that you can trust—we definitely had some bumps there, and if you have to travel it makes it even harder. I did a fair amount of travel in my career. I was lucky that my mother-in-law lives about 90 minutes away in Stockton, and so while it was too far to do the day to day stuff, if my husband and I were both out of town (which we tried hard to avoid) she typically would come. I was lucky to have family support otherwise I don&#8217;t know what we would&#8217;ve done. We would&#8217;ve figured it out but business travel makes it challenging.</span></p>\n<p><b>I just have a cat, and I feel the burden of traveling a lot [chuckles]. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have a cat too.</span></p>\n<p><b>Oh yeah?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve never been a pet person, however, when we moved in 2003, the kids made us feel so guilty that we were ruining their lives by moving and making them switch schools that in a moment of weakness I agreed to a cat. And now my kids are off in college and I still have their cat.</span></p>\n<p><b>How dare they.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And she&#8217;s not even a good mouser.</span></p>\n<p><b>Well what’s the use of that?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She&#8217;s cute. She&#8217;s a cute cat.</span></p>\n<p><b>You as a sum of all of your life experience and your background and your four kids—how do you feel like that affects the way you approach your work and kind of what you bring to the table?</b></p>\n<p><em>One of the biggest lessons you learn in parenting is to separate the behavior from the person. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All kids misbehave, and parents need to guide them to behave appropriately. But you need to separate out I love you from I don&#8217;t love the fact that you wrote on the wall or didn&#8217;t obey the curfew etc. </span><em>Fundamentally a lot of managers in the business world aren&#8217;t good at that. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They do a poor job of giving feedback because they don&#8217;t make that separation.   &#8220;Hey, you&#8217;re smart, you are a really good employee, but next time you do a project like that here’s how you need to do it differently.&#8221; I think that&#8217;s hard for a lot of people yet it’s one of the more fundamental parts of management. I also believe just having my children kept me grounded and balanced. What I notice now that my kids are out of the house, where—typically I don&#8217;t have my kids around in the evening I no longer have a forcing function for me to shut off work.  I recognize how much my kids helped me keep a more reasonable balance—it  was a good thing. Now I have to develop alternative mechanisms.  For years when my kids were little I tried to shut work off from 6:30 to when my kids went to bed—I would try to be pretty vigilant unless it was an absolute work emergency to focus on the kids. People talk about work-life balance and I think that it&#8217;s healthier. For me, I can easily get overfocused on work—I&#8217;m the type that I would get more consumed with my work, probably to an unhealthy degree when I’m passionate about what I’m working on, so it&#8217;s healthy for me and my family to be not so one-sided. </span></p>\n<p><b>I can relate in a different way. Just starting this year, to learn of the value of taking little breaks. I had to do it through meditation, but it is a life changer, honestly.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s funny you mention meditation, but I started when I was CEO of SugarSync.  SugarSync was exciting, but it was very stressful.  A couple of times we had very little money in the bank account when I was fundraising, and so there&#8217;s definitely a lot of stress there so I did this mindfulness-based stress reduction class. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever heard of the MBSR, it&#8217;s basically meditation class. I found it to be very helpful. I should meditate more often, my life right now isn&#8217;t quite as crazy, but I think it&#8217;s a really great tool.</span></p>\n<p><b>What other disciplines, or life practices did you discover over the course of your career that made it possible for you accomplish all that you have?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At that same time at SugarSync, I started working out more regularly in the early morning. And actually, I can send you a link. There was an article on the Wall Street Journal about me doing this morning hike routine with some girlfriends, and it was a two-fer because I&#8217;d get the exercise which would clear my head. And frankly, I&#8217;ve always found outdoor exercise to really be much more of a stress reliever, head clearer. If I can&#8217;t do it outside, I&#8217;ll go to the gym and that&#8217;s helpful, but when I can, my favorite thing to do is to hike outside. Ideally with friends, and so it&#8217;s social, but if that doesn&#8217;t work out schedule-wise, I&#8217;ll listen to a podcast or listen to music, or just enjoy nature. And that&#8217;s one nice thing living here, one minute from just beautiful places to walk.  It&#8217;s amazing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And I&#8217;ve always kept up my friendships, my girlfriends. I have more time now for that then I did with young kids at home—we hike with them or try to meet for lunch or coffee.</span></p>\n<p><b>You were lucky to learn early on that other things matter. And taking care of yourself matters. And things other than the product, like exercise, friendships, the people in your life. I think a lot of folks take a lot longer to learn that here. I learned after I worked in tech.</b></p>\n<p><em>I think because of having kids from the beginning of my career always had a life outside of work. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And I think I&#8217;ve always been a social person. The exercise piece for me, it took ‘til about I&#8217;d say my mid-thirties for me to enjoy exercise. But now I love it, like I said, especially if I&#8217;m outside. And now I&#8217;ve gone back to my music and that&#8217;s something that with kids at home there was just no room in the schedule.  I didn&#8217;t play violin literally for about 28 years, and I&#8217;ve picked that back up about a year and a half ago. I&#8217;m enjoying that very much. I&#8217;m not as good as I use to be but I’ve made peace with that fact and am improving with practice.  I also enjoy the social since I do chamber music, that&#8217;s been fun.</span></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s really neat, it&#8217;s nice that it&#8217;s all coming full circle.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, the violin thing was something I had a mental block on, and I actually just wrote a blog post about that a few weeks ago.  I kept on putting it off because I didn&#8217;t like how I would play. I had set this standard for myself and then wasn&#8217;t playing because I knew I wouldn&#8217;t be above that standard. And then I finally realized, well it&#8217;s not going to get any better and I&#8217;m just missing out. When my youngest son went to college I realized if I don&#8217;t do it now I&#8217;m probably not going to ever. And so I got over that hump.</span></p>\n<p><b>I grew up playing classical piano, competitively. I&#8217;m sure you can relate, practicing like four hours a day and it&#8217;s your life and I quit when I went to college, and wasn&#8217;t competing anymore so I didn&#8217;t see the point.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay. So then, you totally understand.</span></p>\n<p><b>I have the same issue where I can&#8217;t even touch a piano, because just the pain of knowing that I can’t produce the perfect thing that I use to produce, so what&#8217;s the point.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did those competition things with violin. We had this thing in New York called New York State&#8217;s School Music Association, where you&#8217;d go and play for a jury—chose a piece, and it would be at a certain level, and you&#8217;d get graded. So the highest level of pieces, I think was six or seven, and I was playing at that level when I was a junior and senior in high school. So, the piece I was playing when I picked it back up, and not playing easily, I think was a four or five. I don&#8217;t know if your music teacher did this, but you&#8217;d work on a piece of music and then they&#8217;d put the date, and say like, &#8220;For next week’s lesson, learn this movement or learn up to this repeat,&#8221; so I realized last spring, I was working on something I had worked on in seventh grade. I regressed a lot but I have some things I feel like I do better but the technique is not the same.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, you know, I just decided to get over it.</span></p>\n<p><b>It&#8217;s what you have to do.</b></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m curious now, because I know how growing up with that discipline has affected me in good and bad ways in my tech career, which in so many ways is the opposite discipline of classically trained music. So, I&#8217;m curious to know how that upbringing—a rigid, strict, music upbringing (with perfectionist aspirations, because that&#8217;s built into it) affected your approach to your work, for good and for bad.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;d say on the good side, it makes you appreciate diligence and working on things, especially things that sometimes come slowly. Even if you have a lot of talent, learning pieces, perfecting it, it&#8217;s sort of a day-by-day, little-by-little process. So just I think having that self-discipline and diligence is what I got out of it. But the perfectionism is dangerous, and I sometimes suffer from that. [chuckles]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The technique that my husband has tried to get me to use is, &#8220;Okay, you&#8217;re not satisfied with this. That&#8217;s fine. You have your own standard. But, if you were looking at this as a third party, how would you view it? What grade would you give yourself on a 1 &#8211; 10?&#8221; And if I really put myself in that outside shoe, I think I&#8217;m actually fair. I&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Okay, it&#8217;s a seven. It&#8217;s an eight. Whatever it is. This marketing campaign, you know what, it was pretty good,&#8221; But because, for me, when it&#8217;s not a 10, I can be very hard on myself. But I wonder if that was caused by the music or if people like you and I gravitate towards classical music, or survive through the years of classical music, because we have that. And the people who are just always going to say, &#8220;Oh, seven or eight&#8217;s pretty good. Those are the people who quit, because a lot of people quit classical music. The cause and effect of this whole topic I&#8217;m not clear on.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, it&#8217;s a big question.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would suspect that is part of your current work too. That you go the extra effort to get the lighting and the setting, to get it all perfect—it&#8217;s like that extra diligence.</span></p>\n<p><b>For sure. I love that we&#8217;re having this conversation. </b></p>\n<p><b>You&#8217;ve seen tech through a couple of cycles and I&#8217;m curious to know your thoughts on where it is now, what excites you about tech, and what frustrates you about tech.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What really excites me is with the modern tools how quickly we can build interesting, useful things. My current startup, we&#8217;re two engineers—my two co-founders—and myself. Of course I wish we were going faster and that we shipped last but we’re able to leverage all these great tools in technology and build a lot quickly. That&#8217;s very exciting and satisfying to me, just the technical progress that we&#8217;ve made and the experiences we can offer. That really excites me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What else? It has this—and I&#8217;m not talking like the unicorns and stuff—there&#8217;s a little bit of the gold rush mentality, where I feel like because tech has gotten so exciting, people who really aren&#8217;t truly passionate about it, it&#8217;s the hot thing to do. Just like when I finished business school in &#8217;88, not that many of us came into technology. You had to be really, really interested. Most people were doing investment banking or consulting out of Harvard Business School. By the way, some of them loved finance and loved management consulting and were great at it, and some people were just the, &#8220;Well I&#8217;m going with what&#8217;s the hot, popular thing.&#8221; </span><em>We&#8217;re getting a lot of people in tech here in the Bay Area who I think are doing the hot, popular thing. That is distracting. It makes for some junky stuff in the system.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Even so it&#8217;s still, to me, just very exciting. What we&#8217;re able to build. </span></p>\n<p><em>I wish we had made more progress on things like diversity. I&#8217;ve been here long enough to see that, no, we actually haven&#8217;t. It&#8217;s the same, or it may be slightly worse.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> That shouldn&#8217;t be. </span><em>Other fields have made progress. When I graduated from college in &#8217;85, med schools were 75-25, they&#8217;re 50-50 now. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our industry’s poor diversity is frustrating to me. I&#8217;m trying to do my part on that. Not just on the gender front, too. I read this article about Howard University—that they&#8217;re having trouble getting the Silicon Valley firms to recruit there, at their CS department. There&#8217;s no excuse for that. They claim they want to hire more people of color, then go there. I&#8217;m sure there are great students. I wish we were making more progress.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For me, technology is still just super exciting. One of the things I&#8217;ve always loved is how much variety I&#8217;ve had in my job. Most of the people in my family are doctors, and medicine is a great career, but I think what you do doesn&#8217;t change as much. It&#8217;s very important work, and I think it&#8217;s satisfying, but for me I like the fact that there&#8217;s been just so much change over, you know, what I do. For instance, in 1988—my first job was was as product manager in Informix, we did all these trade shows and seminars and data sheets and sales calls, and I just think about how the marketing discipline has changed, how technology has changed&#8230; it&#8217;s very exciting. So </span><em>I think I would have been bored elsewhere. It&#8217;s never boring here.</em></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, I agree. What sort of advice would you have for women in tech, or women entrepreneurs, or even mothers in tech based on what you&#8217;ve learned?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good question. One piece of advice I&#8217;ve given people is, </span><em>I wish I had gone to the startup world sooner. I think I perceived it as being very risky, but there&#8217;s risk anywhere. You could be at Yahoo now and chances are you&#8217;re worried about getting laid-off. You might as well be in a startup where you have more control over your destiny, there&#8217;s more transparency.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nothing wrong with big companies, I worked for big companies for 20 years, but I&#8217;ve enjoyed the startup world more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, if I’m asked I always tell women not to wait to have kids. You never know. There will always be jobs but biology doesn’t wait. I&#8217;ve just had friends with a lot of disappointments and struggles. Those decisions are harder to change or undo. You can always find a different job. If you&#8217;re confident, you&#8217;re hard-working, I think that will work out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most importantly, If you&#8217;re planning to work and have kids, you need to really make sure your partner is committed to that. I&#8217;m very fortunate my husband and I feel like really we&#8217;ve partnered over the years, on the kids and the household stuff, and we’ve supported each other. We have different things we have done for the family, but I really felt like it was a shared enterprise. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take the longer view—actually Sheryl Sandberg writes about this pretty clearly in her book. Let’s say you&#8217;re in your late twenties, so you&#8217;re relatively early on in your career, and you have a toddler and a baby. Childcare is going to be expensive, and because you&#8217;re early on in your career, maybe you don&#8217;t make that much more than what the childcare costs. It&#8217;s easy to look at that as, well then maybe I might as well stay home. But you&#8217;re looking at current income and current expense, and you really need to look at it with let&#8217;s say a 20 year future view. And your current childcare expense is an investment in your ability to earn income 10 years down the line. And I think when your kids are that age and you&#8217;re not sleeping, and you have maybe an annoying boss and whatever else is going on, you feel like it&#8217;s always going to be that way, but kids actually don&#8217;t stay babies for very long. It seems like when you&#8217;re in that sleepless state it&#8217;s going to go on forever. Let&#8217;s say you have two kids and they&#8217;re three years apart, after eight years everyone&#8217;s in school full-time. Maybe after three years kids are in school part-time, and it starts to be more manageable. I think it’s important to sort of step back and take the longer view. </span><em>I had a lot of friends who dropped out of their careers at the baby stage and now they&#8217;re not quite sure what to do with themselves.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When your kids leave for college I think it&#8217;s a tough stage and it&#8217;s really tough if you don&#8217;t have either a career or some kind of intense volunteer interest.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, everyone has to do what&#8217;s right for them. I try to be careful not to be too judging—I mean, it&#8217;s a personal choice right?</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Tell me about your early years and where you come from. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born in Toronto but moved to the UK when I was two and so grew up in England. I went to a fantastic all girls school and then a mixed school for my last two years which was an international school, which I think was a really big change for me. It was a private, international school that I got a scholarship to, and suddenly I was meeting people from Japan, Nigeria, Malaysia, Colombia and it really started to change my opinion of the world and what opportunities there were out there. I went to University in Bristol and studied geography for no other reason than my sister had done and I thought it would be a sensible choice. When I was thinking about jobs and what to do after I graduated, a friend worked in recruitment and told me to interview for a position he was looking for in marketing. I did that, got the role, graduated from Uni on the Wednesday, and started work on the Monday. It was a post-production agency that was really hard work; late hours, getting paid absolute peanuts. But I was quite quickly given my own stuff to run which I think I really enjoyed. I had a fantastic boss, a woman who was really smart, very inspiring, and I thought she was just super cool. One of my clients at the time was a branding agency who I got on really well with and eventually I moved to join their team. When I got there I just thought it was cool. We were going on photoshoots and working with glam clients. Then, at one point, one of my clients was an internet service provider in the UK, called BE. They were a testing ISP of a larger corporate company but when I started working with them I realized I basically knew nothing about the tech industry and needed to shape up my knowledge.</span></p>\n<p><b>Tell me everything [chuckles].</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was thinking, &#8220;What do tech people do?&#8221; I had a team mate working on the account who had all this knowledge, and I was asking, &#8220;How do you know this stuff?&#8221; He was like, &#8220;The internet.&#8221; I think he told me to check our Mashable or a site like that. And then I bought a copy of Wired and I remember reading it for the first time so vividly. Literally, cover to cover, more than I&#8217;d ever read any other magazine and was like, &#8220;This is smart, and relevant, and interesting,&#8221; and I got really excited about it. Shortly afterwards we took a new client which was a dating business. They used to run a white label network and we would try to suggest to them new propositions for their portfolio. We pitched some cool ideas, they just didn&#8217;t really work out. But me and the friend got really interested in the space, talked about making up our own site, started working on something, the guy who I was doing it with then moved to Paris, so it all stopped for a bit. Then I was in the pub with a girlfriend one weekend, she had split up with her girlfriend, and she was asking me what dating sites I was using and despite everything I knew about about the industry the best website I could suggest to her was this awful one I’d been using for about 6 months. And that was really depressing. So I thought, maybe I could make something better, something for women. So I started to learn to code. I moved in with my dad to save money, and sold everything I owned. I quit my job, ran out of money, went to work in a pub, got into an accelerator in the UK, and then started to hire some people to join the team. Then it all just kicked off from there, and now I’ve been doing this for the past three and a half years nearly.</span></p>\n<p><b>What were the qualities of the old dating apps that you saw for chicks that were so just so bad? Like what sucked about it?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I first started I still didn&#8217;t know anything about tech or product. I started about thinking of the problem as a branding one. It always confused me how being single was seen as a bad thing. I mean I&#8217;m still single now, I love it. I&#8217;m a very independent person and I like that like freedom. And I always thought it was weird that all the dating products tried to ‘fix you’ and they were trying to insinuate that it was wrong being single and they could give you the solution to the problem. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I made Dattch, which was how Her started, it was called Dattch, it was purely about the brand, really. I took exactly the Grindr model and thought, &#8220;If that works for guys, it can work for women.&#8221; But once it went out, we also started to realize that actually, branding&#8217;s great but branding doesn&#8217;t make a product, and a community, and actually build it. Actually, we worked out that all the stuff that worked so well in Grindr, just didn&#8217;t really suit our user base and what they were looking for, and how they wanted to start conversations. Women are so hesitant about starting talking. They&#8217;re really slow at sending messages and they always want the other person to message first. The way Grindr works is, you got two guys that are just going to send each other messages. You&#8217;ve got no barriers. Whereas, girls are much more hesitant about it. So, the actual interaction and experience inside of it had to be completely different in a way that worked much better for women, and so that&#8217;s what we started to do. </span></p>\n<p><strong>When did you decide to transplant to Silicon Valley proper?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a big conference in San Francisco called Lesbians Who Tech, and in 2014 it was the first time it had been held in the city. I had met the founder in London, who asked if I’d want to pitch at the conference. I did and it was the best reaction I had ever had to the app. I mean, fair enough, it was a massive auditorium of lesbians, it&#8217;s going to be a pretty good reaction, but it was just so positive. People were fist-pumping and whooping, and I was like, Oh. My. God, this is crazy.&#8221; Dave McClure was judging and he offered me investment then and there. Then a couple of other people offered investment, and I&#8217;d never had such an amazing response. I then started moving back and forth between London and SF and in October 2014 we hired our first team mates over here, our designer and a community manager. When we then raised a round of investment over here and it all just started shifting in this direction. We then had more users in the US than the UK and I think I just knew that for the people that we wanted to hire, for the money that I wanted to raise, it made more sense for us to be in America. We did Y Combinator this summer and that was the last push for me so I moved March 2015, nearly a year ago.</span></p>\n<p><strong>What was it like being in NYC and being in Silicon Valley as a non-technical, queer-lady founder?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think being a founder, the hardest thing is always hiring people and raising money. It’s hard finding the right person that’s ready to join the team, that&#8217;s going to be a great culture fit, that&#8217;s skilled, that is going to grow with the company. I think that&#8217;s been quite difficult. And then investment&#8211;  it&#8217;s really difficult for dating companies to raise money, let alone one that is totally focused just on the female side of the market. And, frankly, no one&#8217;s done what we do, most mainstream dating apps monetize off of men and they build in triggers and an experience that&#8217;s really based around men because they know what men will pay for. But we think that&#8217;s because the products are built for men, and so they can focus on what men pay on, but when you’re looking at women, it’s just different, and we’re going to show how it will work with women.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then on top of all those hard bits of being a founder, being a queer-lady founder has its own nuances. I think the best way I’ve heard it being described is that you just don’t get the benefit of the doubt. And that is so so important when you’re starting a company. You need people that will take a leap of faith with you and it takes a lot longer to find those people when you’re a queer-lady founder.</span></p>\n<p><b>You’ve touched on this, but can you tell me more about what it&#8217;s like fundraising for an app for queer women to dudes who are mostly white and straight?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of our money has been raised from angels, and so I think because of that I get a lot more honesty from people. I think its probably the same with all LGBT issues, there&#8217;s a big lack of understanding. People won&#8217;t necessarily know a gay person or a trans person. In the very early days when I was first starting, I’d immediately get asked after pitching, &#8220;So are you a lesbian?&#8221; And it made me think, if someone&#8217;s pitching you a taxi app, is the immediate question &#8220;Are you a taxi driver?&#8221; It was such a different kind of question because they looked at me and didn&#8217;t see what they expected someone that was into women to look like. But I think over time as our numbers started to show how well we clearly knew it, it became less important. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think some of the weirdest stuff that happened was when we gave an account to potential male investors so they could have a look at the app, and there&#8217;s some who would message stupid, filthy stuff to the users. Like super&#8211;</span></p>\n<p><strong>Really?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, like sexy stuff. And we’d see it as a team thinking, we can see you doing this. What do you think is happening here? Some people would go through the app in front of me saying, &#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s fit. She&#8217;s hot. She&#8217;s hot. She&#8217;s hot,&#8221; and I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Dude, this is not your dating app to be going through. This is us talking about you investing in the company.&#8221; I assume everyone has shitty things that happen when you&#8217;re raising money. I have friends who are female founders who have male co-founders and they&#8217;ll never get asked the questions. It will always be the guy that gets asked the questions. And I think I&#8217;m a single founder and I don&#8217;t think anyone has ever questioned whether a woman should be running this company. I think they know that that should be me. </span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. So interesting. But have you found investors that you just love?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The investors we have are so awesome. One investor, Ligaya, she&#8217;s wonderful. She got it right from the outset. Oe of the first investors we spoke to that knew how to build communities, but in a really practical way. Then Alexis, he’s one of the founders of Reddit. And I think he just understood communities and sub-communities so well, I hadn’t realized how great it was when other people knew what it was like to run a company like ours. Doing YC, they are very, very smart people. And it&#8217;s incredibly hardcore, but they’ve been absolutely great. Some of the relationships can depend a lot on the time and availability of a person. I love all of our investors. I really do. </span></p>\n<p><strong>That&#8217;s great.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I might rely on them more because of being a single founder. If there&#8217;s big decisions or things coming up, I&#8217;ll bounce off them a lot more.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Totally makes sense.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I have six women out of our 30 investors and that&#8217;s pretty good.</span></p>\n<p><b>What have been the most fulfilling, wonderful, exciting things about being an entrepreneur?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think most of the time &#8211; this is me very personally &#8211; I don&#8217;t realize half the time what I&#8217;m doing and so I think all these moments fly by and you just completely miss them and don&#8217;t even realize that they happen and then you&#8217;ll get the odd moment where you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Shit. This is pretty crazy. This is so weird that this is what we&#8217;ve done.&#8221; I just remember last summer, I was driving to meet an amazing women that led Diversity and Inclusion at Facebook. I was driving out to Silicon Valley, in the car and I was thinking, &#8220;This is mental. I&#8217;m driving to meet Sara, going to Facebook. When did this happen?”. I think the people that you meet are mind-blowing. Smart, charismatic people who I respect so much. Most days or weeks we’ll get messages from users saying, &#8220;I&#8217;ve now been with my girlfriend for a year. This is amazing.&#8221; I think the stories I like the most, are the girls that have discovered their sexuality through the app. They came out, or they realized that they didn&#8217;t have to come out, or just found a set of people that made them feel great. I think that, for me, feels more like one of the most fulfilling parts of what we do. I think it&#8217;s great for someone to find their partner, and the person that they&#8217;re in love with. But to know that about yourself, and to feel comfortable with yourself, and unafraid to be who you want to be, I think that&#8217;s pretty amazing. </span></p>\n<p><b>So where do you think the qualities you have come from, that made you just feel like you could start this company? Like the entrepreneurial—the being okay with risk, being okay with hiring staff and delegating, where does that come from? Does it feel innate or learned?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I&#8217;ve always been &#8211; and I know everyone says this is a bad word, but I&#8217;m totally fine with that &#8211; I&#8217;ve always been quite a bossypants, which was part of a strong determination that I have. And I’ve also been amazingly supported and encouraged by my mum.  She was definitely very focused on me being very independent, and focusing on what I could do, not setting any limitations to what job I could do, which probably gave me the confidence to take riskier steps. I think a lot of people don&#8217;t do things because of fear, and I didn&#8217;t have a lot of that, I always thought, &#8220;Sure, I can do this.&#8221;  With hindsight it was probably just a huge level of ignorance, of having no idea of what I was undertaking, and not even stopping to think about it. I definitely rush into things a lot, and too often, and I get told off for that a lot. And I don&#8217;t listen to people, I kind of blast on through stuff. If I actually knew what I was undertaking, there’s no way that I would think that I could do it. Because I didn&#8217;t know what it was, and I always knew what the next step I wanted to do was, it&#8217;s just everything led to the next thing.</span></p>\n<p><b>Tell me more about the Geek Girl Meetups.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, Geek Girl Meetup is one of those parts of my life that makes me so happy. It’s a group of amazing women that organize it, awesome women that speak and a great powerful network of people that’s building with it. It used to be an annual conference in London and me and two friends didn’t feel like one conference was enough. There were amazing speakers and attendees and we wanted to see and hear from them more. So we started going for breakfast together to make plans about how we could make this happen more often. Then we invited people on the email list to join. Then we started to get official speakers along. So it turned into monthly breakfasts that would have anywhere between 50 and 100 women. Both men and women come along but we always get female speakers as we thought it was so important for other women to see great role models. If you see someone achieving something it makes it feel like you could be that person or take that path too, and that was really important to us. We did the conference every year and that will be anywhere from 200 to 400 women. Again, lots of speakers. Very interactive. I think it feels different because it is organized by women and we think of things that maybe other ones don&#8217;t think of: there&#8217;s always a creche, the food is always good and healthy and there&#8217;s yoga &#8211; just things that we wanted to see at an event. Now, that I&#8217;m in SF, we should be setting it up over here. Heidi who originally founded it, she&#8217;s over here and so I think we&#8217;re going to set it up and start doing it here too.</span></p>\n<p><b>Other than what you just described, what support networks have you found here in San Francisco?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">British people have been a really big support network [laughter]. I think when you come somewhere and you don&#8217;t know anyone, you look for a link to meet new people. They were often British founders and so I built quite good relationships with them and then people that I already knew in the London scene who then moved here, they&#8217;re people that I stay in touch with quite a lot. The other teams that did YC, the people who were in my batch, I&#8217;m really close with some of them. There&#8217;s a group of four of us that meet up once a month and exchange the progress that we&#8217;ve made. I think I lean on my investors a fair bit if I&#8217;m looking for help with something specific, and there&#8217;s a few that I&#8217;m close to that I&#8217;ll probably meet up with like once a month or every other month, one on one, and they&#8217;ll. I don&#8217;t go to as many of the events I used to do in London, I think because I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing when I first started and I had to assimilate a lot of information. Now I’m more focused on specific areas or problems or challenges where I know I need to learn a lot more. I’ll ask to meet a specific person or go to a very tailored event to stay as focused as possible. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Yeah, you know what you need.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the early days I was just thinking, &#8220;I need to meet people.&#8221; Because I didn&#8217;t know any people. That was the first level. Know some people.</span></p>\n<p><b>What other struggles have you faced in your time here, either related to entrepreneurship, or living and surviving in San Francisco?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">London&#8217;s so big, and so diverse, and my friends are from such a different backgrounds and skills, and I think there&#8217;s a great upside in people in San Francisco working in the same industry as you, understanding it so well, but then it’s hugely lacking any kind of diversity. There&#8217;s not the same racial diversity, there&#8217;s not the same cultural diversity, and I think I missed a lot of that when I moved here. I finish work at 10, and if I want to go get a drink with someone and some dinner, I can&#8217;t do that here, and that pisses me off, like I want to get late night crazy. I think I just didn&#8217;t realize how techy it was. I knew before I came here if you go to Hollywood it&#8217;s going to be filled with actors and actresses, and all the marketing will be for movies. I just didn&#8217;t know San Francisco was that much tech [laughter]. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of my friends is just starting up a company in London. It&#8217;s a restaurant, but I think she&#8217;s just firstly starting to realize the sacrifices you have to make &#8212; it&#8217;s not sacrifices because you don&#8217;t see it as a bad thing when you&#8217;re doing it, but how your life changes. It’s entirely consuming or it has been for me. I think my way of approaching it has been, &#8220;I want to give this everything I have otherwise I&#8217;ll feel like I didn&#8217;t try hard enough, and if I&#8217;m doing this, I really want to know that I tried my hardest to make this work.&#8221; Just the concept of normally getting drunk on weeknights or socializing or just hanging out with a friend for dinner, you just don&#8217;t really do that anymore. You don&#8217;t go out Friday and Saturday. You&#8217;ve got to work one day of the weekend so you have to plan your hangovers. All those friends you used to see only at group events, they&#8217;re the ones that you don&#8217;t talk to anymore. Realistically &#8212; if I have one night off per week, all I want to do is sit in my PJs, preferably in bed, and just not to a single thing or talk to anyone. And it means that you miss a lot. And that was definitely a big, big change that I only realized how big it&#8217;s been now, with hindsight. I used to go on vacation three times a year, now I haven’t been away for 2 years, it’s all a big change.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. I saw on the internet a couple of days ago, Randi Zuckerberg who posted about the Entrepreneur’s Dilemma— Work, sleep, family, fitness, friends. You can only have three.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Totally makes sense. It&#8217;s a lot.</span></p>\n<p><b>What is it like using your own app as the founder?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s really awkward [chuckles]. I used it a lot more in the early days and [chuckles] I think, I don&#8217;t know, I think because it wasn&#8217;t a thing then, almost like the user base was so small, I think I felt more comfortable doing it. Now, honestly it&#8217;s just incredibly difficult. Like we do so much testing on the app, and I&#8217;m constantly using it to test new builds and so I will like some people. It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m genuinely liking them, it&#8217;s just because I&#8217;m testing if the like button works. I use it so aggressively, it&#8217;s really hard to remember who the person was that I had wanted to get a date with the next weekend. So logistically it&#8217;s actually quite hard. I also get a lot of messages from girls on the app, saying, &#8220;Thank you so much, this is awesome.&#8221; &#8220;Do you have any jobs?” “Can you change this bug?” “Here&#8217;s this feedback.&#8221; And that confuses me using it for dating!</span></p>\n<p><strong>Have you had any mentors or people that you&#8217;ve looked up to for inspiration?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like I have but&#8211; the people I&#8217;ve had as advisors, it changes, in cycles almost based on what we&#8217;re working on and I guess their availability and my availability. I remember, I think my first ever boss was really hardcore and I really liked her and she was very thorough and I think she probably set my mind of the kind of person who I wanted to be. I then went through a phase of messaging every person I wanted to learn from. One of the big TV networks in the UK, called ITV, had a woman that was Head of Digital there, and she was awesome. I remember her talking at an event I’d been at, so openly, realistically and practically. She was an absolute badass and hearing how she made compromises and how she realistically balanced her life made me see how hard but how possible it is to be in that kind of position.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are your motivators? Like, what drives you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I find it really hard to pinpoint what it is that drives me. Sometimes I think it’s just a fear of failure, other times it’s the want to do better than the day before. I feel pretty tunnel vision about what we are doing, nothing else seems like an option.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? What excites you, what frustrates you, what do you want to see change?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all I’m really excited about it. The discussion people are having about diversity can only start to have a positive impact, but it’s probably my biggest current frustration. The way the system works is such a game and it’s going to take a while for the new rules to be written. So until then we’ve all just got to play along with the crappy current rules.</span></p>\n<p><b>What advice would you give to young ladies who are hoping to do something important or build something impactful? What do you wish you&#8217;d known in the beginning?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No one is going to make this easier for you or lay down the path for you to step on to. If it’s in you, to build something or start something, you’re the only person that can make this happen. Realize what the worst thing is that could happen if you take that risk, come to terms with it, then step up and start taking the risk.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Where do I start?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where do you start? </span></p>\n<p><b>Where were you born?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born in Taipei, Taiwan. I moved to Los Angeles when I was 11 with my dad. I mostly grew up with my dad. My mom was in and out. </span><em>I think that both parents were together until I was two, and then my dad got into financial difficulties and Mom bounced.<b> </b></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But she would come in like every day, basically weekdays, to come see me. So it still feels a little like there was two parents, but she was working day job and night job. In between, she&#8217;d come have dinner with me. Yeah, so I grew up that way. And yeah, that was that, so they were never married. My dad already had a family that lived abroad, and my mom&#8217;s like way younger than my dad, which is pretty cool. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[laughter]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m a little bit of a momma&#8217;s boy. She’s like a best friend that I didn&#8217;t get to spend much time with, so even to this day I’m still trying to make up for lost time. So ever since college I started going back to see her in Taiwan, and I try to spend a lot of time with her when I’m there. Of course, it’s not the same spending time together now, but we have fun hanging out. She always wears heels. You should see her feet, it&#8217;s disgusting. </span>[laughter]</p>\n<p><em>Because my mom always wore heels and I would hear her footsteps walking up to the door every day at 6, and I&#8217;d jump up and go open the door for her, because then that means we&#8217;re having dinner and that’s my favorite time of the day.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Yeah, so that&#8217;s my upbringing. And I moved here to the US when I was 11, there&#8217;s lots of reasons why we moved here, there&#8217;s some financial reasons, there was also some drama between my parents to say the least, it was not something I wanted or had any say over because I was a kid. It&#8217;s definitely not something my mom wanted because she wouldn&#8217;t get to see me and I was her baby, but it was a lot more complex. Anyway, I came here because of all that and more.</span></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s hard.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes.</span></p>\n<p><b>How long until you saw her again?</b></p>\n<p><em>I actually saw my mom just twice between the age of 11 and 18. She would come, and it wouldn&#8217;t be pleasant because of relationship, psychological and financial burden.</em> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychologically it was a burden because she doesn&#8217;t speak the language and was dependent on my dad when she would rather not have anything to do with him. </span><em>Just to see me caused her all this grief that I understood later on.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In the beginning I obviously didn&#8217;t understand or was mad that I didn&#8217;t get to see her more often. So there is a lot of issues there, but then, fortunately, I now have the ability and the freedom to do whatever I want.</span></p>\n<p><b>Did you have half siblings and step family?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. Not step family. I moved here and I moved in with my father&#8217;s family. There are three older half siblings. The youngest older sibling was 11 years older, and then the oldest is like 16 years older. About the time when I moved in they were all grownups already. There were issues there when I first moved in, but fortunately, now we&#8217;re all awesome. I see them all the time and we’re great because we’re all grown ups and that&#8217;s so amazing. We all like each other. We all have beef with the older generation. But that’s not unique to our family.</span></p>\n<p><b>Such interesting circumstances to grow up in.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. But you learn. Obviously at first I just hated everybody and stuff.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what you end up learning is—you learn how to make people like you because you&#8217;re going into a place where you hope they like you, but they don&#8217;t. But then you do whatever you can do to make them like you. You get really good with people. Separately, you learn to see their perspectives. I heard the version of my life and my dad&#8217;s life from my dad&#8217;s perspective and I heard from my mum&#8217;s perspective. And then, I heard it from my dad&#8217;s wife perspective, and her kids’ perspectives. All these perspectives are different, and you learn there&#8217;s no right or wrong. Just different people. It&#8217;s not even about what events actually transpired, but how you felt about them and everyone felt differently. Whatever they felt is the thing that affects them. There&#8217;s no debate about that. </span><em>That’s probably my biggest lesson in life—that&#8217;s very good to develop early on because later on you go to college, you have these hard-headed people and they have all these opinions and I&#8217;m just like, you know what, &#8220;You&#8217;re both right.&#8221; [laughter] &#8220;I can see both of your points and I&#8217;m glad you guys feel so strongly.&#8221; [laughter] </em></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, that&#8217;s really incredible to have that perspective come out of what is a really complicated situation. To be a kid and to get perspective from that, instead of process it in a really bad way.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The perspective happened over time. [chuckle] It doesn&#8217;t just happen—I wasn&#8217;t that smart of a kid.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[laughter]</span></p>\n<p><b>How did you first get interested in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a kid, I always liked computers. And my dad didn&#8217;t know anything about computers, but he got me one. So I played around on it, but I didn&#8217;t really—there&#8217;s no structure or training on it. And I didn&#8217;t really have anyone to teach me. My dad didn&#8217;t work, so my mom worked. She put me in some computer classes. I learned a few things as a kid and then </span><em>once I moved to the United States, I stopped all my computer stuff just trying to learn the language and not get bullied in school.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I still played on the computer, but nothing constructive. In college, I got exposed to startups, starting with social enterprises. So it was about how there are these organizations where you could make a change in the world and the positive change about social issues, but you&#8217;re not dependent on donations, which I think is a stupid model with some exceptions. But do you have money coming in? Donation model works for some other things that have no market mechanisms, but having a market mechanism to solve some of the social issues—that was an amazing model to me. And I&#8217;ve never seen that before. And I was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s so cool. Everyone in the valley is working on stuff like this? That&#8217;s cool.&#8221; And then, &#8220;What else are they working on? Oh shit! There&#8217;s tech start-ups.&#8221; I had a few role models that were a year or two older than me in school at Stanford who ended up doing their own startups and I got to know about that and started thinking about it. And then it reminded me of when I was a kid and how much I liked computers. I feel like that&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve always wanted to do.</span></p>\n<p><b>So you wrote a piece on mindset inequality recently. It&#8217;s resonated with thousands of people, and it goes into you growing up super poor and how that completely affected your time in grade school, your time at Stanford, and your path to being an entrepreneur.  By no means do I want you to repeat the whole article, but can you just go deeper into that struggle of being poor and being from an underprivileged background and how that affected you in ways that people just don&#8217;t even understand from the outside?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. I think it&#8217;s very hard to understand it.  I think a lot of narratives are about the outlines, like where you came from, how opportunities open up and the step you took, and then what happens, but what&#8217;s less discussed that is very real and that is your entire thought process walking through that. How do you even know how to take advantage of the opportunities even if they were presented to you? </span><em>If you&#8217;re not thinking about the opportunities the right way, and you have no one to show you how to think the right way, then you are severely disadvantaged.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> My whole point in the article was that mindset difference is the main thing that could hold you back—there are other factors obviously, but the way you think is one of the more important ones that’s the most insidious and least discussed. Like, people say, &#8220;Oh, yeah, the system is broken.&#8221; Yeah, of course the system is broken, but </span><em>my mind—how I think about approaching problems—is different from friends of mine who come from more privileged backgrounds. The way they see the world is very different. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, so that was my main point. </span></p>\n<p><em>When you’re from poverty you are likely afraid to create conflict. When opportunities present themselves to you; you walk through it; you don&#8217;t want to fuck it up. It might just get snatched away from you, so you tend to minimize your own presence and so you&#8217;re not able to take full advantage of the same opportunities.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s a lot of other stuff. One thing that actually was most surprising to me—I added the whole point about guilt—like I didn&#8217;t have that in the first draft, and I added it and that resonated with a lot of people. </span><em>You have a feeling of guilt that you&#8217;re constantly carrying with you, so everything you&#8217;re doing it feels like you&#8217;re not supposed to. Like, somehow you got here (whatever it is, Silicon Valley, nice tech job, nice school, etc) but you know your people are suffering &#8211; which makes you very tentative in everything you do.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Even if you manage the guilt successfully, you navigate through it, you sometimes wonder what people would think of you at home. And yeah, so there&#8217;s a lot of that guilt and it could feel like shackles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of that there are probably like hundreds of things wrong with your thinking, like how you think about / manage money, etc. But what’s “wrong” with your thinking used to be “right.” I used the term “bugs,” like buggy software to describe how your mind may think sub-optimally. Imagine your mind&#8217;s an operating system like a computer, but then there are some things about it that are just not working the right way. Calling it “wrong” came off as if I might be attacking some people. That&#8217;s not what I meant to do. These “bugs” used to be “features.” Okay, my example. </span><em>I got really good at building a connection with people because I got empathize really well. That, I&#8217;m very proud of, and that I constantly use to my advantage. I use it to access opportunities. I use it to make friends. But when I have to cross people I find it very hard, when I have to tell them they&#8217;re wrong, when I have to stand up for my own interests&#8211; I find that very, very hard. And that is fine most of the time unless you&#8217;re doing something that requires that. Being a CEO, for example, requires that. Actually being anything where you need to assert yourself. That makes it hard. So what used to be a feature, once you change your goals, becomes a bug.</em> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not that the bug is bad. It was a feature before. So it&#8217;s just about understanding exactly—being completely aware of how you think, and how it might not be as useful, and then being flexible about it. And not have it to be tied to your identity and that kind of stuff.</span></p>\n<p><b>There&#8217;s so much in that I can relate to. As I was reading your article I was just like, yep. Yep. Yep.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[chuckles] And this is something that I&#8217;ve been getting lots of responses. Like from around the world. All kinds of backgrounds. Social economic classes. Like different colors of people, cultures, and languages. It&#8217;s crazy. The honest truth is even if you&#8217;re upper-middle class, your parents barely made it, and they&#8217;re probably like barely hanging on. And so with the way that you were taught they probably came from the lower class. So their mentality has not changed. They got to middle class and they&#8217;re happy, but their mentality never changed. So growing up with that mentality, you have some of these same issues.</span></p>\n<p><b>Do you find that people make assumptions of you based on where you went to school and being an entrepreneur now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, yeah. </span><em>After writing that article people were like, &#8220;Holy, shit, I didn’t know that about you.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yeah. Like, of course, because I don&#8217;t look someone who would have that story.&#8221; <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Couple of things. </span>I&#8217;m Asian, I&#8217;m a guy, and I live in Silicon Valley, which means that I look like an engineer, which is the opposite problem from what the valley is talking about </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[laughter]. Like I&#8217;m a #ILookLikeAnEngineer. I look like an engineer except I’m not. That&#8217;s funny. </span><em>Yeah, so I&#8217;m not an engineer, but fortunately that&#8217;s a privilege I have &#8211; I get to just play that role. Like, people usually don&#8217;t ask and they just assume. If they ask, I tell them, and they&#8217;re shocked. They’re like, &#8220;What? What do you do then?&#8221;</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then like the fact that I went to Stanford, I think there&#8217;s a whole set of assumptions about just like what my upbringing must be like, what my parents must be like, what I did at school, that kind of stuff. Yeah so, yeah, it comes out.</span></p>\n<p><b>Is that awkward for you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s not awkward, but it just happens. I think it&#8217;s just more like—I just find it funny that people make those assumptions and I correct them. In college—even at a big place like Stanford—you have lots of pockets and circles of different people. I think that people that look like me—who come from where I&#8217;m from—tend to hang out in this one circle, except I kind of like going to different circles and even shocking people, and that kind of stuff.</span></p>\n<p><b>You do?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s awkward. I think it&#8217;s pretty cool.</span></p>\n<p><b>Me too!! I like being uncategorizable.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don&#8217;t put me in the box.</span></p>\n<p><b>Exactly.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boxes are boring [laughter].</span></p>\n<p><b>Okay, so you jumped straight into entrepreneurship out of school. I know you were super inot the idea of entrepreneurship out at Stanford, so was it a hard decision for you, or was it just a no-brainer?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, no no no, it&#8217;s very hard. Freshman year—I mean this is like &#8217;06, &#8217;07, &#8217;08, &#8217;09, &#8217;10 right? So financial crash. Well before the financial crash it was very much no tech. Not much tech. Google was the only thing. Facebook was getting started. Most of my friends, if you&#8217;re not an engineer, even if you&#8217;re an engineer you might work at a quantitative hedge fund or something like that. Or you work in finance, you work in consulting, and most of my friends did it or they go away to summer internships and they come back and tell me about it, and they&#8217;ll tell me how much they’re making, like even for just that summer. I just couldn’t believe the numbers. I remember calling my dad sophomore year, and I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;This friend of mine just got a job at Goldman Sachs and this is how much he&#8217;s making.&#8221; And then I would agree on the phone with my dad, like, &#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll be doing.&#8221; [chuckles] Except </span><em>I found something that I actually liked [chuckles], which is really tough because it happens to not make money.</em> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I remember my call home between sophomore and junior year, I would tell my dad about my friends going to consulting, banking and how much money they’re making—but then I’d start transitioning to “Oh I met this investor who invests in startups, he’s rich.” Then after few phone calls I started working on startups and I started to going to these internships at start-ups and VCs and I’d tell my dad about my internship at a VC. “VCs, they’re rich.” Yeah, right?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then at one point I started easing into into the fact that I won’t be rich any time soon. I would just drop these hints—I&#8217;d go off from being rich to meeting rich guys in Tech to being an entrepreneur, which is not rich at all and a terrible way to make money. Then </span><em>I had fights with my dad, because he depends on me.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Fortunately with him I’ve always strong headed so he had to give in. I also would point to him that he used to be an entrepreneur, &#8220;You did the same thing,&#8221; honestly. My dad didn’t like rules and did it his way so I&#8217;m going to do it my way but, yeah it was very hard, though, because he is looking out for himself. And I want to look out for them. I’d talk to my dad or my mom and I’d hear about money problems, and we’re talking about like, being able to pay the utility bills. I can change this so easily. Honestly, I’d visit my mum and the roof is leaking. I was like, &#8220;What&#8217;s the bucket doing here?&#8221; and she&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s leaking because it&#8217;s raining out.&#8221; I&#8217;m like &#8220;Fuck. I could have fixed this very easily.&#8221; Or my dad having just got in a car accident, because he&#8217;s old and doesn’t see well—shouldn&#8217;t be driving that much really—but then he has this big, surprise expense. With the money that he gets from the government and from me—there&#8217;s not enough to cover. And so I sent him the money to cover it, but then the saddest part is not just about sending him the money. It&#8217;s him knowing that I don&#8217;t make very much, and that he shouldn’t be a burden to me. So with this car accident—he didn&#8217;t ask. </span><em>He usually asks for money, but he knows I’m struggling. He knows he fucked up. He crashed a car, but then I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll send it.” And then he tells me about the traffic ticket he got because of the accident. But he says, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll take care of that one.&#8221; But then just the fact that he didn’t ask me—I know how he&#8217;s going to take care of it. He&#8217;s going to go to another friend and borrow some money from him, right? He CAN’T take care of it. I could’ve. I should’ve. But the fact is that I can&#8217;t solve this minor issue because I chose to do a start-up and I pay myself very little, I remember after this call that lasted about 10 minutes, then I walked around for the next 15 minutes just because I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;What the fuck? Why am I doing this?</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I can&#8217;t&#8211; this is a tiny problem. This is a couple hundred bucks man. But yeah, I can&#8217;t solve it.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, and what a huge burden that not everyone has. For a lot of people their parents are taking care of them while they&#8217;re building companies or doing their first jobs or whatever. And instead you are feeling crazy guilt for not potentially being able to take care of your parents.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, and it&#8217;s not rational. You have—after my essay went live—most people understand. But there&#8217;s people like, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you just bite the bullet and just go work?&#8221; And most of my friends did that. The thing is they do it, and they never get out of it. </span><em>It&#8217;s not that easy to go from nothing to something then back to nothing again, so I just stayed at nothing. So I&#8217;m still at nothing right now. </em></p>\n<p><b>How was YC for you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Great. YC was amazing. It was transformative, partially because first of all, we didn&#8217;t even know what fundraising was, right? </span><em>So two guys, coming from our backgrounds—how are we going to get the money to start a company, right? </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if we wanted to. So we found out about Y Combinator through Startup School, a conference they hosted on Stanford campus, and that was the only funding source we knew. We didn&#8217;t know investors—or we didn&#8217;t think we could get it. YC positions themselves as what you do before you hit investors. Like very, very early. </span><em>So YC at the time gave us $20k total to split between three guys. And we&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh my God, we can work forever with this money!&#8221;</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So we moved into this one house together and then we just—and like, this money, is like, &#8220;We can do it full time! Holy shit!&#8221; Our alternative was like go get jobs and work on this at night, right? Which is what most people in the world do.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yep.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[chuckles] Holy shit. We can do this full time, we better do it. The money like to them is tiny. Like 20k like seriously. But to us that money was like, Oh my God. It&#8217;s amazing. It&#8217;s like, It&#8217;s freedom. In YC you get the same feeling that you have when you step on Stanford campus for the first time. You are like, &#8220;These people are the best people at what they do ever. Like, Oh my God. I&#8217;m so happy to be here. They&#8217;re so good at building products and everyone is nice and supportive. And Paul Graham is just like father figure. I remember when he actually remembered my name because he&#8217;s very bad with names, but, when he remembered my name and he said my name’s Ricky. My co-founders were like, &#8220;Holy Shit. He remembered your name.&#8221; Yeah. That&#8217;s pretty cool. So I see him just like the very demanding sort of father figure. It&#8217;s pretty cool.</span></p>\n<p><b>Did you feel any of the same struggles that you had at Stanford?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In YC it’s not like we&#8217;re spending that much time with other founders. So it&#8217;s very isolating. YC brings a little bit of community element, but it&#8217;s largely just you and your co-founders in the room living together, working together. But YC was pretty authentic. Pretty genuine. And the limited interactions you have are all very positive. I think after you leave YC, you start fundraising and then you start meeting more people in the community, becoming friends with those people and then you start thinking—wow, some of these people are thinking very radical thoughts. And then </span><em>they go to these retreats in the woods, they go to Burning Man, and you&#8217;re just like none of that is part of my experience. I can&#8217;t afford to go to these things and I don&#8217;t know how to value these experiences. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But still, I want to be exposed to the experiences, so I try to participate to my best ability. Yeah, but you can&#8217;t help but think that you&#8217;re different. But all this is just on the surface level—social level. What&#8217;s interesting is sort of what I&#8217;ve wrote about. How does that translate operationally, like building a successful startup? If you feel different from them, how is your thinking different? So that&#8217;s sort of where that matters more because I want to succeed. </span></p>\n<p><b>How do you think your upbringing, and specifically the point of view that came from that, affects how you approach building a company?</b></p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;m good with people, but in asking people for money, it&#8217;s just not a thing that I know what how to do.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Even if I had a great conversation with an investor at the end, when I ask for money I&#8217;m incredulous and surprised that you even entertain the thought that you want to give me money. And then after we get the money—If you thought 20k was a huge amount, imagine getting 500k, or even more than that, and then you&#8217;re supposed to use that to hire people, and you&#8217;re supposed to spend like—</span><em>an engineer is 100k a year, and I’ve never seen that kind of money before myself, but you&#8217;re supposed to pay somebody that amount while you’re scraping by with a lot less than that. </em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only that, but convincing somebody to come work with you. </span><em>Great people have lots of options, so even being able to conjure up the crazy confidence to say, &#8220;You should reject that job at Facebook or Google that&#8217;s paying you 150k and is secure, and nice, and helps you learn a lot.” And at startups, you don&#8217;t actually get to learn that many technical things, you just do things. There&#8217;s no mentorship—you&#8217;re supposed to give all that up to come with me to pursue this crazy dream. How do you even start describing that to someone when it&#8217;s hard enough to convince yourself that this is actually achievable? </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So that&#8217;s a constant&#8211; like over the years I&#8217;ve constantly worked on it, I&#8217;m like consciously go talk to people, I pitch them a crazy dream, and then I ask them if you want to come work with us, and it&#8217;s very intentional, like everything I&#8217;ve trying to overcome, even sounding like a crazy person, that could potentially know something that you don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s all like practice, and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s the same with a lot of people no matter what background, but it&#8217;s just so out there for me.</span></p>\n<p><b>Have you had mentors, or inspiration, or moments that really stuck out to you that helped you along the way? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. I think I have lots of mentors. I see a lot of them as mentors. Nothing formal. I mean, there&#8217;s a couple guys, like Michael Wolfe or Ming Yeow Ng or Avichal Garg. Some of these guys are just a couple years ahead of me. Michael is a lot of years ahead of me—got two kids and stuff. But I think part of it is these people sort of see me as almost an equal, and I can spar with them and go back and forth. It&#8217;s not even just about the transmission of information. I definitely get a lot of great advice from them, but just the fact that you can look at me as a person who has the potential to succeed? That&#8217;s huge for me. So yeah, people who do that with me who are, I think, clearly way ahead of me. That does more than even the words they say. Yeah.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are your biggest motivators?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s changed over time. </span><em>I think a lot of what drove me to Stanford is just a desire to get out and make a better life. And then once I realized what I want to do, my motivator is to do it, because someone like me is not supposed to. And so I think the motivator there is I don&#8217;t want to play by the rules that most people play by.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And the rules are determined by where they come from, and where you come from is just luck. I guess I&#8217;m impatient, and so I want the best options, even though I don&#8217;t get to have them. But it&#8217;s just like, I want to try to get at it. Yeah, and I think that’s kind of a spoiled way to think.</span></p>\n<p><b>Which is ironic.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. [laughter] No, </span><em>I&#8217;m definitely spoiled in terms of my ability to pursue these things. Just the fact that I wrote something that millions of people share experience-wise, but my particular voice was heard. That&#8217;s not an accident, it&#8217;s because I happen to be in the inner circle. And I happen to be in the position where I can say these things, and I happen to have gone through experiences that helped me best articulate them. And so, with that, I&#8217;m just going to keep going and see how far I can take it. I&#8217;m already positioned well, despite my circumstances. So, let&#8217;s just see if I can keep proving people wrong and stuff.</em></p>\n<p><b>What are the best parts of being an entrepreneur?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every day I like going to work—I can&#8217;t wait to work anytime, every time, all the time. You get to learn so much about yourself. So, like aside from creating something which is rewarding in and of itself, having customers basically beg you and tell you how much you’re helping them, that&#8217;s rewarding for anyone! But most importantly I think the fact that it&#8217;s the hardest path, it&#8217;s the most painful path, but also the best way to learn about yourself and how the world works. If you&#8217;re a nerd and you like geeking out, and you like to upgrade your brain, this is the best way to upgrade your brain.</span></p>\n<p><b>What have been the hardest parts?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Same. [chuckles] So it&#8217;s like learning about how poorly equipped you are, and learning about all the things that you don’t do well. You don’t have any buffer. If you make mistakes it&#8217;s so costly because you&#8217;re right there in it. </span><em>My mood is 95% tied to the startup. You&#8217;re constantly counting your mistakes, and you&#8217;re thinking about what if you make one too many and everything falls apart</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>.</em> A lot of people say the hardest part is that you have to fire people and that kind of stuff but on top of that for me it’s that, “What if I don’t get to do this anymore?” Maybe this is my one shot. I know the whole point of the valley is that it’s not a one shot thing. The valley is very tolerant of failure. I&#8217;m sure if I fail I’ll get to do it again if I wanted to. </span><em>I have failed already and I continue to do it, but then there’s always this thing at the back of your head that’s like, “What if I don’t get to do it again?” </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So that’s scary.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, especially when you don’t have a safety net in the same way that other people might?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, that helps. Yeah but I think the valley itself is the best place in the world and the reason is because the valley itself is a safety net. </span><em>I still believe if you are hardworking, you have ideas, you have some special ability, or you can work at it, the valley will give you chances, people here will give you chances.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> They know it’s hard they’ve all failed before so that’s super cool. That’s why I&#8217;m here.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do folks from home like family and friends you grew up with how do they feel about how you&#8217;re doing?</b></p>\n<p><em>I think they&#8217;re just very proud that I went to Stanford, I think that&#8217;s it. I mean my mom didn’t really know what Stanford is. I don’t think they understand anything I do after that. The fact that I&#8217;m making any money at all doesn’t make any sense to them.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So, I mean I don&#8217;t talk to any of them about business. I can&#8217;t. They don&#8217;t know what to say to me. But generally they’re very supportive now that I&#8217;m grown and they are too. So, it&#8217;s great. Plus, I&#8217;m always the outsider. I was brought into my dad’s family and I&#8217;m not connected to my mom as much as I’d like to be. So I&#8217;m always kind of this person that pops up from time to time. I show up and you love me but you might not get me. And that for me is okay. You know like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t get me? It&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;m not that easy to get anyway&#8221; [chuckles]. No boxes.</span></p>\n<p><b>You&#8217;ve been working in tech for a long time. How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think it&#8217;s great. Back at Stanford the reason why I loved startups—or entrepreneurship in general—was the idea of it is so empowering. It doesn&#8217;t matter what you do. At the time we couldn&#8217;t get anyone to start companies. And we didn&#8217;t even know if we can start a company ourselves. So, our whole message was like, &#8220;No matter what you do &#8211; go be a lawyer, go be a banker, go work at Google &#8211; but be more entrepreneurial in your thinking when you’re there&#8221; as much as we can preach, because people were not doing it. Now everyone is doing it, so like in a way I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;That&#8217;s awesome!&#8221; Because that&#8217;s always what I always wanted. </span></p>\n<p><em>There&#8217;s a lot of bad ideas, but like the sheer number of people who are starting companies, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s going to be a lot more great ones, and it’s going to change all different aspects of the world.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I think it&#8217;s great. But I&#8217;m one of the Kool-Aid drinking population in tech. I think we are in the “deployment period” of technology. Some academic wrote about that and lots of VCs talk about it. We might not get there right away, but I think tech is going to change every single aspect of our economy, every single industry. It&#8217;s going to be productive in the long term. Like this tech, there is no boom or burst. This is just a long term boom for the next fifty years until something happens. But I&#8217;m totally on that Kool-Aid. I love the Kool-Aid.</span></p>\n<p><b>[laughter] So, where do you see yourself in five or ten years?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know, hopefully, hopefully PRX.co—this is the business that we pivoted to recently that started to work really well. And this would be our second time around building a new business and I just want to take the lessons that we’ve learned, and then with all the mindset changes that we’ve made. I want to channel all those energies into this company to make sure it&#8217;s very impactful. And one of things that David and I have always looked to do is to bring the best people together, and we never got to do that because we never scaled up that much. And as we bring the people together, we want to treat them differently. </span><em>I think coming from where we come from, there&#8217;s a lot of stuff that we could do, in terms of how employees are compensated, in terms of management, culture, in terms of when we speak up about diversity, and different types of issues, we have the moral authority to do them justice at least within our company.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And so with the essay I wrote, that’s just the first time I&#8217;d written down anything in public like that, but we definitely want to do something as part of the business. I hope that would offer a different kind of narrative in the valley. Tech can and will be a lot more inclusive. So I don&#8217;t really know yet, but I think it&#8217;d be good.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are some of those lessons that you&#8217;ve learned from the last few years that you&#8217;re applying now in your new company?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growth is everything. I think, after awhile, everyone says the same thing, &#8220;growth is everything.&#8221; And we were not used to being very aggressive with growth. When you make a million dollars in revenue, it&#8217;s hard to say, &#8220;That&#8217;s not big enough.&#8221; But understanding the game here in the valley —if you were to build a business anywhere else in the world there&#8217;s a way you can do it, and we probably did it that way—but the reason why you won&#8217;t build businesses here in the valley is because you don’t have the risk appetite. You need the ambition to build a very different kind of business. So just really understanding what that entails on a day to day level, in terms of your decisions to hire, your decision to build your product a certain way, the way you market yourself. That&#8217;s all lessons that we&#8217;ve taken. Just a lot of those things.</span></p>\n<p><b>What advice would you give to folks from similar backgrounds to you who are hoping to get into tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think you&#8217;re more than capable of joining the tech industry. </span><em>It doesn&#8217;t matter what skill sets you have. The industry is pushed forward by people who just want to do things. Who are doing things without permission. Who would do things without being told what to do and who would pick up skills that they don&#8217;t have just on their own volition. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is what happens on the regular basis, so it doesn&#8217;t matter where your starting point is. Just don&#8217;t feel like an outsider. </span></p>\n<p><em>Every industry eventually forms the in-crowd / out-crowd. Sets up rules and social norms and old boys clubs. These things exist in tech, sure, and it could be intimidating. But instead of focusing on that, focus on the fact that this is the most fluid industry that embraces outsider thinking and has a natural repulsion to rules and structure. Take advantage of that very pure ethos of the valley.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you have those ambitions you will be able to achieve and join the ranks. As you navigate that, just be very cognizant of how you&#8217;re thinking differently. Yes, you probably come from a different background and you probably can’t relate easily. But don&#8217;t see it as a handicap, and definitely don’t stay on the outside because of it. One trap I fall into is, if you&#8217;re not as privileged, you tend to hate people who are privileged. I definitely went through that period. I hate all the spoiled kids. If you can&#8217;t participate you tend to end up hating. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s as productive. By not hating, and even learning from it, it doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;re now one of them. I think that&#8217;s the thing that people conflate. Your identity doesn&#8217;t go away. You learn from them because they have skills or ways of thinking that help them achieve the things that you want to achieve. That&#8217;s all. Just look at it that way, and that&#8217;s it. Don&#8217;t get trapped in hating, I think. That&#8217;s all.</span></p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Why don&#8217;t we start from the beginning? Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born in Redding, California. My parents lived in Hayfork, which is a small town about an hour and a half outside of Redding. My dad is a Seventh Day Adventist minister and my mother is an RN. So I grew up in a very kind of traditional, middle-class, American home. I grew up mostly in Northern California. My dad moved around a bit because of working for the church. I lived in Redding, lived in the Napa area for a while, moved back to Redding. I did junior high, high school there in Redding. I don&#8217;t know, I guess during that time I had no clue where my life was headed. I was obviously dealing with a lot of gender stuff, even at a young age. But growing up in a pastor&#8217;s home, you&#8217;re not really able or ready to deal with that. So things didn&#8217;t really connect with me on the identity front or even the career front until much later in my life. I homeschooled for a while when I was a kid. Mostly because I did really well in English and reading and those type of things, but not so good in math or the sciences, so I was constantly fighting this battle over either being really behind everyone in terms of math in school, or being really ahead of everyone in terms of reading. We would have lesson plans and I would finish and then just be sitting there bored for 25 minutes. In fourth and fifth grade that&#8217;s not a really fun place to be. So I homeschooled third, fourth, fifth and sixth grades. Went back in seventh grade.</span></p>\n<p><b>What was it like coming back in the middle of middle school?</b></p>\n<p>It was really different. Going from homeschooling we had these booklets. So you would work through the booklets and then basically for a school year you had to finish 12 of them. You could do them at your own pace, so I would actually do most of them really early, I would work really hard and finish my entire year of school in less than a year of actual school. Which was great, because as a kid it gave me much more time to read and study the things I wanted to study, and tinker with computers. Growing up I had a Commadore 64 that I liked to screw around on. It gave me the opportunity to have a lot more free time to play with things, which was kind of fun.</p>\n<p><b>So you were tinkering with computers. What were the early inclinations that you may be interested in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s one of those things that I can look back now and identify stuff, but at the time I had no clue. Hindsight is 20/20, you know? I remember in junior high once I did go back to school—- it was when the TI graphing calculators were really big, and it&#8217;s amazing because they haven&#8217;t changed at all, even now, but the TI-83 and the TI-85 I think, or whatever they were— I used to take some of those with my friends and we wrote choose-your-own adventure RPG games in the style of those books, where there would be story things that were happening and you would choose where to go. It&#8217;s essentially like what twine games are now, especially in the queer women&#8217;s community. There&#8217;s a lot of twine gaming stuff. But we were doing that on a graphing calculator and passing it back and forth in class to play each other&#8217;s little games. That&#8217;s probably one of the most crystallized moments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I played a lot of video games and computer games. Being somewhat gender-weird and feeling like an outsider, spending a lot of time at home on the computer, and lived on message boards and in online chatrooms and in game lobbies, playing games with weird people from all over. I guess technology always kind of was a connection to other people. It was definitely me reaching out trying to connect with people like me, other weirdos. It was a way of connecting that was really easy for me. Tech allowed you to be whoever you wanted to be, which was kind of cool. I think those are some of the earliest times when I noticed that I was somewhat good. I built a Windows 95 machine by myself and would take apart computers and rebuild them. I don&#8217;t do anything with hardware now, but looking back I can see the little kernels of getting interested in some of this stuff.</span></p>\n<p><b>So, take me from getting a Master&#8217;s in Fine Arts and Theatre, and then eventually becoming a self-taught coder. Walk me through college, and that kind of wild transition.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I went to college after high school. In high school I played in a lot of bands and was really interested in extracurricular stuff, and didn&#8217;t really have an academic focus. I learned that I kind of liked English a little bit more than I thought I did. But the big thing that I loved was theatre. I got to college, and first quarter I decided to audition for the play that the school was doing, and ended up getting myself cast in a devised ensemble theatre piece that we created ourselves, rehearsing 20 hours a week on top of our freshman load of classes. So I really fell into the theatre. </span></p>\n<p>I changed my major 13 times in college. The first time was before I even got on campus, because when I registered switched my major and my minor, and so I had to change my major before I even started classes. Then I largely changed every quarter. Sometimes it was like minor changes, like I changed my minor out, I started off as a History major with a Religion minor. I dropped the Religion minor and then I added a Photography minor, then switched and did a Photography major and a History minor. Dropped the History minor, added a Graphic Design minor [chuckles]. It was just incremental weird changes. But again the kind of consistent thing in my life was theater. I was in theater rehearsals pretty much every quarter of my college experience.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By my Junior year, I was TA-ing for the Intro to Theater class. Freshmen when they would come in or— we made people who were trying to get teaching certificates take the class. For the education students, it’s a class which helps you get comfortable being up in front of people. I was the TA for that class for two years as an undergraduate, as a Junior and Senior. I kind of realized that I really enjoyed the classroom, I really enjoyed I had that realization that ultimately I liked learning. It didn&#8217;t really matter what major I was. I just enjoyed being in class. It kind of became clear that I needed to go to grad school. I very quickly settled on an English degree with an emphasis in Theater. I declared that my Junior year, winter quarter, and I graduated at the end of a regular four-year college program, which is kind of absurd [chuckles]. </span></p>\n<p>I was in an honors program which allowed me to get rid of most of my general ed and just take one honors course a quarter. It was Greatbooks focused. Some of them were more scientific, some of them were more literature-focused. We had one called Pattern which became relevant later on. We read Godel, Escher, Bach and we read Flatland and we talked a lot about things that would become more important as I became a software engineer. Just in terms of pattern recognition, how you build things and build systems that talk to each other. It&#8217;s funny because because that was actually the class that I hated the most out of my entire honors course. It just didn&#8217;t seem as relevant to me. It&#8217;s funny that that&#8217;s the one that now is probably the most relevant to my work.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I Graduated in 2010 and had, in January of 2010, applied for a master&#8217;s program in theater education. One of the three programs in the nation that really focus on this,and it was in Richmond, Virginia so I moved cross-country. I&#8217;d only ever lived in California. Moved to Richmond, Virginia and did two years of graduate course work there. That&#8217;s also when I started to come out and transition. It was kind of during that time, and then graduated from there in 2012. So I went straight from undergrad into graduate work. Graduated with a master&#8217;s degree at 22, 23. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After grad school, I moved back home with my parents and promptly couldn&#8217;t get a job doing anything, anywhere for any money. I had applied for teaching positions all over the nation. I had applied for adjunct for full teaching positions. I came pretty close to one position teaching theatre, actually at my undergrad, which was a conservative, private, Christian college. It was right before, and during as I was dealing with gender issues. It&#8217;s probably a good thing  I didn&#8217;t get that job, looking back on it. So I moved home with my parents, and got a minimum wage job in San Francisco, doing customer service. I guess it was a little bit more than minimum wage. San Francisco minimum wage is $12, and I was making $14. I worked for a company called The Civic Center Benefit District, literally cleaning the streets, interacting with the homeless population in San Francisco, helping visitors to the Civic Center District find their way to the symphony, the opera house, picking up syringes on the ground.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was not fulfilling work. It was not work I felt good about doing. What the company would say, and what the company would make us do were two very different things. They said that our job was just to advise homeless people about city ordinances. Then they wanted us to actually enforce and get people to move on and not camp in front of businesses that were paying the Benefit District money. So I really struggled with it from a moral sense, but I needed the money and I was getting to the point where I didn&#8217;t want to live with my parents any more. I had started transition. I needed to start my own life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A friend of mine who is a Software Engineer for Intel and the Yocto project. She came down and visited San Francisco, and we went out for drinks one night. She was like, &#8220;You should teach yourself how to program. I think you&#8217;d be really good at it.&#8221; I was like, [chuckles] &#8220;Are you kidding?&#8221; I didn&#8217;t deliberately take a math class in college. I have not taken a math class since high school. My junior year of high school, and I intentionally planned it out that way. I took the honors programs that I didn&#8217;t have to take any math. She was like, &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to know math to be a good software engineer. That&#8217;s a lie.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So she planted this seed gave me some stupid trivia question. The question was essentially like, &#8220;There&#8217;s a wall and there are two light switches on one side and three lightbulbs on the other. You start on the side with the light switches and you can only go to the other side once. You have to figure out which light switch goes to which bulb.&#8221; The solution to me was very apparent. You turn one light switch on for a little while and then you turn that one off. You turn the other one on, and you go to the other side, and you check which one is cold. There are two off; one of them is warm, one of them is cold, and then one of them is on. It tells you which one&#8217;s which. I came up with that answer in about five minutes. She looked at me and she was like, &#8220;You need to go home and start learning how to program right now.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I did. I went home and I started working on Code Academy and started going through their online courses. I started with JavaScript. I found out that JavaScript is really confusing and kind of difficult, and actually gave up at first. I spent two weeks on JavaScript and got really frustrated and felt like it was moving very quickly and I wasn&#8217;t comprehending stuff. All of the extra syntax and curly braces and semicolons were just confusing me. So I gave up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was probably another month or so later I started dating a girl who was a Ruby engineer. We were kind of talking and I told her about my experience with Javascript and she&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, you should try Ruby. I think Ruby would be easier for you. It would be a better way to start.&#8221; So I did.  I started with Ruby and kind of fell in love and rushed through the CodeAcademy stuff and did a whole bunch of other online tutorials. There&#8217;s one called &#8220;Ruby Monk.&#8221; I did Test First Ruby the RubyKoans. I did anything I could get my hands on that was Ruby. And that probably took me about three months or so. I started to feel like I kind of knew what I was doing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I Went to my first hack-a-thon after like two months— I had done a little bit of HTML and CSS work in college on my own blog or when I worked with a theater company I did some of the marketing and ticket sales, so I did a very bare bones HTML site for them. This was the first actual scripting, actual programming. In November of that year, which was 2014, I started working on a web application that indexes and maps gender-neutral restroom locations called REFUGE Restrooms. Started that at a hackathon. The team that I was working with wanted to do it in Python, JavaScript, and I said, &#8220;Okay. I&#8217;ll hop out where I can. I don&#8217;t have a ton of experience with those languages.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the hackathon, they didn&#8217;t really want to keep going. And this was a project that I cared a lot about, and I wanted to use it to keep learning. I felt like I had gone to a point where I knew a lot of building blocks, but I didn&#8217;t know how to build a house yet. I knew how to hammer some nails and do some screws into a few boards, but I didn&#8217;t know how to actually build a table. I had gotten frustrated, but finally I had this idea. I had this thing that I could actually build. So many people, when I started to teach myself, they were like, &#8220;Oh well, just build something.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t even know where start to build something. But finally I had an idea, and so I kind of started and had some terrible best practices in the original version of it, but worked on it for a couple months and took it to another hack-a-thon and got some people to help. In February, we launched the first iteration of it, RefugeRestrooms. During the month of February we got 35,000 unique site visits. And we were featured in AutoStraddle, Bustle, HuffPost Gay Voices, Advocate. </span></p>\n<p><b>Awesome</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p>Mind you, at the same time I was working full time at this minimum wage job. I was pushing code in the morning before work. I usually worked a 2:00 to 11:00 PM shift. I was pushing code during my lunch breaks. I was pushing code after, on the way home on BART. I was coding until 1:00 AM, making bug fixes, because people are complaining about stuff, and then going back to work the next day. I was working eight hours at my job but then a full total of like 14 or more hours a day actually on this. My job really wasn&#8217;t well supervised, so I snuck into the library with my computer and pushing code while I was getting paid to clean the streets of San Francisco. I was working really hard. It was really exhausting. I was responding to press inquiries on my way walking to work. It was absurd.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got to the point where something had to give. To get to the next level in my software engineering I needed to get paid to write code. I needed to spend all day writing code instead of spending all day trying to do other work. I started applying for jobs and applying for internships and entry-level positions and didn&#8217;t make a whole lot of inroads. Almost had a job with a non-profit, but they decided to go with someone who had more experience. I actually posted on Twitter. I was like, &#8220;Hey, I need a job. I work hard. I&#8217;m a self-starter. I completely taught myself. I launched this project from scratch. Someone take a chance on me.&#8221; I got a bunch of responses. Some of them started to go somewhere, some of them didn&#8217;t. but got a response from someone who worked for a small startup about 16 people—YC funded. They had just raised series B. They usually worked with interns from a school, and they were getting ready to have a new intern term, but they were open to hiring an intern not from a school—and asked if I would be interested in that. I said yes. I did a take-home problem for them. Came in, did an interview with them—an in-person interview for half a day. A week later they gave me an offer, and the offer was over twice what my salary was at my old job [chuckles]. I tried not to say yes too fast [chuckles]. Gave a week&#8217;s notice at my old company and very quickly moved into tech. My last day of work working at my old company was Sunday, and I started at the new company on Monday. </span></p>\n<p>Found myself doing this six-month internship at a company that has actually ended up doing quite well. I work for a company called FutureAdvisor. We were acquired in October of this last year by BlackRock—the largest financial asset manager in the world. After being an intern for six months, I got promoted to full time very quickly as teams grow and change.  I am now the most tenured member of the front end team. There&#8217;s only four other engineers who have been at the company longer than me—which is a cool feeling [chuckles]. Yeah.</p>\n<p><b>Tell me what you were expecting to get out of tech—you were hoping to get out of tech, and then tell me how it&#8217;s changed your life?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest thing I was hoping for was a little bit of stability. When you&#8217;re working minimum wage, trying to live in the Bay area is really hard. Stuff has gotten even more ridiculous over the past couple of years, but even three years ago, it was still pretty ridiculous. I had an amazing deal for housing. I had a two-bedroom apartment in Berkeley that I was sharing with someone, and it was 1,300 dollars for the entire apartment, for the two-bedroom. I was paying 650 plus utilities, so my rent was 700-something. My take-home from my minimum wage job was 1,600 dollars a month. Almost half of my paycheck was going to rent. Then commute bart into the city, that’s about 250 bucks a month. Food is another 250 bucks a month, if you&#8217;re living really bare-bones, which meant I had 200 dollars a month of squeeze room. That&#8217;s exhausting. That gets exhausting to live that way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being trans, and having trans health care needs that are more expensive that a lot of insurance still don&#8217;t cover. It&#8217;s gotten better, but you just have a lot more extra expenses. So, I was really struggling, and so I was hoping for some amount of stability, being able to start to craft a life for myself. During this whole process, I ended up having a lot of housing instability. My roommate was going to leave the lease, and I could take over and get my own roommate to come in, which I was really excited about. And then, five weeks before the lease was up, he was like, &#8220;So, I decided to stay, so I&#8217;m showing somebody else your room today.&#8221; And I went, &#8220;Oh, okay. Well, I guess I&#8217;m looking for someplace else?&#8221; I&#8217;d been subletting the room from him essentially, he was the main lease holder. I subleased a small basement room in Bernal Heights for a few months. I lived in a warehouse in San Francisco for a little bit. I moved three times within the space of 1.5 months, which was really brutal and exhausting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, I’ve finally kind of gotten to a little bit of a more secure spot. I make a lot more money each month now. And working for a company that got acquired, I had suddenly extra money that I had to figure out what to do with. Two years ago, I didn&#8217;t have any money saved for retirement. I have $80,000 in student debt, so it&#8217;s really I&#8217;m just really swamped. I&#8217;ve started to make progress on my student loans. I had student loans at Sally Mae and student loans at the government. I&#8217;ve now completely paid off the Sally Mae loans, so I just have the government loans now. I actually, with my acquisition money, because I had already hit my one year cliff when we got acquired. I used that money as a down payment on a house. So, I&#8217;m a homeowner in the Bay Area now. And as long as I make my payments, I have housing stability for the rest of my life. I&#8217;m still getting extra stock payouts every month, and there are bonus pools built into our acquisition deal and stuff. And if those things work out in my favor, I could have the house paid off by the time I&#8217;m in my mid 30s, which is absurd.  There&#8217;s no way I could have even conceived that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was working minimum wage, did not have good health care. My deductible was 1,500 dollars. Surgery was a pipe dream. Being able to get bottom surgery. Suddenly working for a company that has really good health care, because it&#8217;s in tech, and they care about employees. My deductible is 200 dollars. My max out of pocket is 2,500 dollars. I got surgery for 2,500 dollars, which is absurd. It&#8217;s absurd. To go from, that wouldn&#8217;t have ever been a possibility for me, to suddenly, it was within my grasp. It was one of those things in my wildest dreams, I hoped could come from taking a career change in tech, but you have no clue. You have no clue what&#8217;s going to happen. Being someone who&#8217;s trans, being a trans woman, there&#8217;s a lot of prejudice, so you never know if you&#8217;re going to even be able to get a job in tech. You hear that things are somewhat better in tech. You never know, right? And I do think I kind of lucked out that my company really makes an effort for diversity. When I started there were five engineers and counting myself, three of us were women. I guess six counting myself so half of the team was women. That&#8217;s absurd, like that is absurd in startups. So, I kind of lucked out and I think finding the right spot I could kind of thrive in, it&#8217;s not been without it&#8217;s difficulties. As the team has grown and changed and brought on more people and new managers come in and whatever but&#8230;yeah.</span></p>\n<p><b>This is such a good story. I&#8217;m so happy for you. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s been really incredible.</span></p>\n<p><b>I want to know more about your experience as being trans in tech. I also want to know what it&#8217;s like being someone with anxiety and depression in tech. I&#8217;ve talked to several trans folks in this project and I&#8217;ve also talked to a lot of folks with anxiety and depression. I want to know more about both of those for you.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure I guess I&#8217;ll talk about the anxiety first.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is something on a day to day basis that does affect me. For awhile, I was pursuing getting actual medication for it. Let&#8217;s see. I&#8217;m trying to figure out the best way to get into this discussion. Maybe the best way is to, again, talk about the difference from working at my minimum wage job before to now.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When I was working a minimum wage job and I had a really bad mental health day, I still had to try to go to work. I still had to wake up, force myself to get out the door, because I literally could not afford to take a day off. You only have so much vacation hours, you only have so much sick hours. So, you literally can&#8217;t afford to take time off. You&#8217;re also in a situation where because of money situations, your anxiety is increased. So, it&#8217;s a tightrope walk. Right. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting a job in tech alleviates those money concerns. Like, my team has a &#8220;unlimited paid time off&#8221; policy. We also have sick days that our policy is, if you are not feeling well, don&#8217;t come into the office. I haven&#8217;t explicitly talked about mental health stuff with many of my coworkers, but the culture of my company is where somebody just sends an email and says, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m not feeling well. I&#8217;m going to work from home today,&#8221; or, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go home,&#8221; they&#8217;re not met with a lot of questioning of that. In many regards, it&#8217;s a much healthier place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, though, the stakes of my job are a lot higher now. Before, I was getting paid to pick up syringes off the ground. Whether or not I picked them up today or tomorrow, there are going to be more syringes tomorrow. There&#8217;s going to be more trash tomorrow. It&#8217;s a never-ending process. If someone wasn&#8217;t there to tell a homeless person to move down the street, I actually felt better about my day. Versus, I work for a company that, we have millions of dollars under management.  We now are working with BlackRock— are working on major, major business deals. Our first business to business deal was announced a couple months ago. So we&#8217;re now partnering with other large banks to provide our service to their customers. That&#8217;s incredible, right? We have millions and millions of dollars under management. The stakes are all higher. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Granted I work on the framing mostly and I&#8217;m not dealing with the back-end algorithm that could really mess up someone&#8217;s financial future for the rest of their retirement. So the stakes are a little bit lower for me. But tech is a very fast-paced world. It&#8217;s go, go, go, go, go, go, go, which I think can be really hard as someone who struggled with anxiety and depression. I don&#8217;t know, I guess it&#8217;s been a mixed bag for me in terms of that. It&#8217;s been really rewarding to work on a team where I&#8217;m respected and where my opinion is valued and where I&#8217;m seen as someone who knows what I&#8217;m talking about. From a depression sense, it&#8217;s good to work at a place where I feel like my work is important and valued. We&#8217;re not working on Uber for ice cream cones. We&#8217;re working on something that, I think, is making the world a better place. We&#8217;re making retirement more accessible to people who couldn&#8217;t get there without us. That&#8217;s been something that&#8217;s helped my depression. Definitely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being able to create stability for myself has helped immensely. Being able to buy a home, being able to get surgery— those are the things that qualitatively improve my mental health, vastly. Since I bought my house—granted it&#8217;s only been a couple months—I bought my house in November, but my level of anxiety and depression shot down immediately. I&#8217;ve been a medical marijuana patient for a year and a half or two and used that to treat a lot of my anxiety. I was on Lexapro for a while, but realized that when I tend to have anxiety attacks, I tend to forget to take my medication. Which, taking an SSRI every day, you have to remember to take your medication. And so the way that that was treating the way that my anxiety manifest wasn&#8217;t really actually very helpful. But the amount in which I&#8217;ve had to medicate My anxiety and depression has dropped enormously, especially recently, which is great. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think in general, people who work in tech, people who are engineers, are weird people. We are the people that are on the autism spectrum, we&#8217;re the people that struggle with anxiety and depression. So I feel like when I go to work, I&#8217;m working with people who, on some level, even if you don&#8217;t talk about it, they get it. They get when you&#8217;re having a hard time, they get whatever. Which is very different than I feel like working in some other sectors, because again, the people who developed good computer skills and learned how to talk and work with machines, are the people who didn&#8217;t have good people skills growing up [chuckles]. So they were the weirdos, with anxiety and depression, who didn&#8217;t want to go out and socialize and hang out at parties. They&#8217;re the people who just go home, and cuddle on the couch and watch TV every night. So I feel like tech has been a good place for me as someone who struggles with anxiety and depression. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, I think my viewpoint is probably a little bit skewed because I work for a company that I think is really positive. I also didn&#8217;t have to do a transition at work. All of my documentation and stuff were changed before I got into tech. I just came in with all of my documentation saying Teagan, with everything saying Teagan. I didn&#8217;t have to try to transition on a job place and come out to people. I just started work. I don&#8217;t keep it a secret from people. It&#8217;s pretty hard to because— I don&#8217;t know, I wrote this web application that indexes and maps neutral restroom locations and if you Google my name it&#8217;s the first thing that comes up. This advocate article with me. Whatever disillusioned hope I ever had of being stealth or whatever is not something that&#8217;s a reality for me. And I wouldn&#8217;t want to be anyway. It&#8217;s not something I bring up with people a lot, unless I become friends with them through the workplace, but I don&#8217;t try to hide it.  If it comes up in casual conversation, like I sometimes just say, &#8216;Oh, you know, because I&#8217;m trans, like blah, blah, blah this thing that I deal with&#8217; or whatever. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I will say the acquisition process was a lot more stressful because of being trans and specifically because of healthcare. We had a really good health clinic and healthcare plan and policy for trans healthcare. I had already scheduled my surgery. Everything had been approved. Everything was in place, and then three months before surgery we get acquired. So suddenly, all of that is up in the air. When I&#8217;m having conversations then with my superiors about how I&#8217;m feeling about the acquisition, I have to be blatant and upfront about, &#8216;Look, these are all of the things.&#8217; Where other people are just being concerned about money or about if they&#8217;re still going to have their job or whatever, there&#8217;s all of these extra levels of concerns that I had. Going from working a small San Francisco startup to a huge mulitnational corporation— it&#8217;s very different. In terms of how trans people are treated, you never know how that change is going to happen. So it made the process leading up to surgery be really stressful. I was not productive, and it was just from a very logistical standpoint of that all of our benefits suddenly changed. And so there was disability stuff to figure out, and there was leave stuff to figure out that then all had to be redone, and rechanged, and refiled, and you&#8217;re working on the clock. Right, because our benefits changed over January 1st, and my surgery was January 19. So that was an exhausting kind of moment. In general though, I think it&#8217;s been really good. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s another kind of genderqueer person who works at my company. There are two other gay men— so our engineering team is probably about 21 or 22 right now, 22, 23. Four of us are LGBT, so again I think it&#8217;s a little bit of an abnormal sample, not representative of tech everywhere. But it&#8217;s pretty cool, right, to be able to go to work and be seen by your co-workers. You know, there were other people at my company. So working in a really nice diverse workplace, I think has made it fairly easy to be trans in the workplace. I do notice some elements of— I feel like it&#8217;s been kind of creeping up as we grow and become more corporate in our culture, that men&#8217;s voices are being heard more than women&#8217;s voices. I think we&#8217;ve done some hard work to make sure that&#8217;s not the case. We have three, four engineering teams, one of them is managed by a woman. Our director of Algorithms is a woman. I&#8217;m the most senior engineer on the front-end staff, so we&#8217;ve done well and we&#8217;ve hired additional women, but I do notice management tends to pay more attention to the male members of the team, and it&#8217;s not— I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know, maybe it has gotten to the point where people are actually getting paid more than other people. I don&#8217;t know. Salary is such a weird thing in tech.</span></p>\n<p><b>Maybe one last question would be, what kind of advice would you have for people that have faced similar struggles in either gender confusion or poverty, or all of the things you&#8217;ve been through, what are the biggest lessons that you&#8217;ve learned that you wished you&#8217;d known in the beginning?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s hard. I don&#8217;t want to be the person who says &#8220;Work hard and it&#8217;ll pay off,&#8221; because that&#8217;s kind of bullshit. And I do have a lot of privilege, and i try to be cognizant of that. I&#8217;m white. I come from a well-educated background. I&#8217;m suffering from a lot of student loans because of it now, but I was able to go to college and learn a lot of things about the world, which has made it much easier for me to succeed now. And so I think I want to recognize those things because it&#8217;s not just a situation of &#8220;Do good work. Work hard and it&#8217;ll pay off.&#8221; It&#8217;s not that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Absolutely, the privileges and the things that— the situations that we come from affect our ability to succeed. You just have to hustle. Life is a fucking hustle. And, obviously, there&#8217;s mental health stuff and physical ability is— stuff and not everyone can do what I was doing in terms of working 14, 16-hour days to literally just push through. I don&#8217;t know. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Listen to yourself. Figure it out what it is that you want. Set some goals. Start working towards them. Evaluate, move forward. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find a mentorship. I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to do what I&#8217;ve done without mentors across different parts of that journey. Whether it was Beth really on pushing me to even sit down and write my first line of code, or my friend Matt much later on when I had the internship, starting to talk about career development and where I wanted to go and how to maneuver to get promoted to full-time and to start a career track. Find people. There are career people, there are women that have been doing this, and they can help. Maybe not tell you what to do, but provide a sounding board, give wisdom from their own experience. I found that kind of stuff is really helpful because I could ask questions like, &#8220;Am I going crazy or is this something that is actually happening? Is this something that I need to be concerned about with the way that this manager is acting?&#8221; Because it can be really easy to get caught in your own struggle and your own moment, so being able to get a little perspective and jump outside of that is really helpful sometimes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I pay for a therapist every week and it&#8217;s the best decision I ever made [laughter].</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>So why don&#8217;t we start from the very beginning. Tell me about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay. Well I was born in New Delhi almost 50 years ago. I grew up in Delhi, went to school in Delhi, went to college in Delhi— pretty much stayed with my parents until I left home. I left roughly 25 years ago to come to America. The reason I wanted to come to America was very simple. I wanted to be a journalist in a big market and it was a weird idea that I could be. A lot of it was also inspired by my early brush with online communications through CompuServe and reading a lot about </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ARPANET</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_superhighway\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">information superhighway</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. A part of me said perhaps that was going to be the biggest story of my life, and I should figure out a way to write about it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had no idea why that thought clicked in my head, and I still don&#8217;t know, but I think deep down I&#8217;ve always understood that communications are a fundamental human need, and the networks were essentially fulfilling that. But I wasn&#8217;t really clear as to why I was thinking like that. It just was something which went “click-click” and there it was. That was about 25 years ago so I&#8217;ve lived in America half my life and I&#8217;ve lived in India half my life. I traveled a bunch before I got here. I went to England, I went to parts of Europe and here I am. That&#8217;s my story in a TL;DR version, though growing up in India was interesting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I come from middle-class family. The middle class in India is very different now than it was when I was growing up. Middle class India then was very different than middle class in America now or in fact what it was back then. My mom, dad, and my grandfather all worked to make sure that there was food on the table and clothes on our back. We all lived in a very small house. That included my father&#8217;s sisters and my aunts, me, my mom, my dad, and eventually my sister and my brother, my grandmother, my grandfather. The house was about 70 square meters. It&#8217;s a tiny place—but I think our parents will call it big. We still live in the same house back home, like we haven&#8217;t moved. And still— whenever I go back I sleep in the same bed I slept in as a kid and it&#8217;s cold in the winter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went to what we call private schools in America—equivalent of that but not quite because—it wasn&#8217;t really the top private school or anything of that sort. It was just one of the schools you had to pay to attend. Public schools there, like public schools here, are free and but they&#8217;re like public schools everywhere. My mom was a teacher in a public school, but I went to a private</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">school, and then I went to a college called Saint Stephen&#8217;s College, which is one of the better colleges in our country. It&#8217;s around 200 years old so it has some history behind it. I never really wanted to be there, to be candid. I just felt I was going to college because that&#8217;s what everybody does and that&#8217;s what my parents expected from me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I really wanted to be a journalist. I knew that a long time ago. I was almost fourteen years old when I knew I wanted to be a journalist. I just didn&#8217;t have the right phrases for it, but intuitively you know what matters. I had no guidance on how to go about doing things. My whole life has been a bit self directed in that I have made decisions, and figured out what to do after making those decisions. More or less, it&#8217;s worked out. It&#8217;s okay. That&#8217;s life.</span></p>\n<p><b>When were the earliest moments where you knew that you were interested in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I learned how to program in India back when I was like 19 or 20 years old. It was like </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BASIC</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, etc. mostly because my mom said, &#8220;Yeah, it would be good for you. You should just study this rather than trying to figure out a career.&#8221; So I did, and I wanted to be an engineer at one point. Then I realized I don&#8217;t want to be an engineer. The thing which I absolutely loved was writing and through writing, I got a chance to meet a lot of interesting people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around age 20 is the first time I understood that I liked tech. I was writing about fashion and movies and sports and I was all over the place. The thing I loved the most to write about was Formula One. Unfortunately there was no Formula One in India at that time, so I just had to read about it more than anything else. I was pretty nerdy about that stuff. It has been about 27 years now since the first time I wrote about tech. It was about local companies in India who were doing tech, like ATN etc. It was pretty basic at that time. The world is very different today.</span></p>\n<p><b>Walk me through some of the early years. What was the impetus that brought you to the States and into the blogging world in American tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I said, I was very intrigued by the whole idea of ARPANET and the information superhighway and CompuServe. This idea of of online communication. Part of me intuitively knew that it was going to be something important, and it also dovetailed with my idea of, &#8220;What if I just move to the US? This would be a good thing to write about.&#8221; I also wanted to live here because I always felt that I needed a bigger playground. I have these goals I set and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ve met this, now what? What do I do next?&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people like to have traditional things like family and kids, and all those things don&#8217;t intuitively make sense to me. Spending more time on things I like to spend time on was very important for me. I think it was all in my head. All of it was reading. I used to read a lot, and I still read a lot. The more I read, the more I learn how things are, and so that was my path. I came here and after I moved, I was like, &#8220;Oh my God, this is not going to be that easy.&#8221; It wasn&#8217;t that easy. You make a decision, you&#8217;re here, and you&#8217;re kind of stuck with that decision for a while.</span></p>\n<p><b>How did your family feel about you leaving for the States? What plans did they have for you and what did they want you to be growing up?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mom and dad would have been very happy if I became either a doctor or an engineer. And I don&#8217;t really know what I would have been if I stayed there, but I knew I wanted to be a journalist a long time ago. I wasn&#8217;t very clear how to go about doing it. I always had an opinion about something. This was always the case with me. </span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. So, let&#8217;s talk about the earlier years of your journalism career like tech blogging in the 90s.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I didn&#8217;t start blogging in the 90s, I started tech blogging on December 13, 2001. Specific date. Before that, I used to write for Forbes. Before that I was doing a lot of shit work for three years or so—doing a lot of freelance. From there I went to Forbes.com. From Forbes.com I went to Red Herring. From Red Herring to Business 2.0. When I was at Red Herring in 2001, after September 11th happened, I wanted to move back to New York. When I moved back to New York I realized that I was working for a monthly magazine and I had a lot of time and a lot of information which I wasn&#8217;t really doing anything with. </span></p>\n<p>At that time the internet start-up ecosystem had collapsed and so there was very little technology coverage. I had been reading and collecting my pieces on my personal website. I used to occasionally write a newsletter or opinion pieces except they were were not really blogs because they were just long pieces. I would write them and publish them as an email, and then put them back on my website as an archive. So it wasn&#8217;t really a blog but I just tried Blogger and the like until 2001 when I went all-in. I started linking to whatever I found interesting and commenting on it. So that&#8217;s how my tech blogging career started.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In doing so I may have sparked something in a sense. I was the first guy who started reporting on original tech stuff, new stuff without really realizing that I was the first guy to do so. But I started writing—about 95% of what I did on a daily basis had no takers because the magazine could only publish one or two stories a month and about 95% of the stuff fell on the floor. I just started putting it on my website and that&#8217;s how it started and slowly grew from there.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. Walk me through what, in the 14 years since that happened— what have been some of the most exciting moments of your work? What are the things about it that really activated you and what were the things that you were proudest of?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t know if there is any specific moment that I can say that was special. I just say the whole thing has been special. I think from the day I started until today that I might have found my art form, right? It was not traditional journalism, it was not writing news. It was a little bit of opinion. I think my whole past was building up to me being a blogger. Because when I was a younger guy, I worked at an Indian newspaper— magazine called The Sun. It was a teenage magazine and they published a lot of pop music news and Hollywood news and my job would be to read 100 or so Hollywood magazines and pop music magazines and listen to music charts from short-wave radio and figure out a way to write about it. Essentially, it was not really reporting, it was like rewriting a lot of the stuff which was done and putting it in a little bit of context, so it was essentially a form of blogging. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then I worked at Forbes, where they teach you to write succinctly, very short. The biggest lessons in the 90s from Forbes was if you write 1000 words, you can write it in 500. If you write 500, you can write 200. You start to look at it and you&#8217;re just like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; You&#8217;re trained to rewrite, trained to write tight, and trained to ask tough questions as a reporter. All of these things came together as a blog format for me, in a sense. I found that that was my form. There are very few people who I think do this, natural-born bloggers. </span><a href=\"http://scripting.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dave Winer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one, I think </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Arrington\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Arrington</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is definitely one  That&#8217;s why he was so popular. Most people don&#8217;t quite understand that. To some extent, </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgsiegler\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M.G. Siegler</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one of those people, and I was one of those people. </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianna_Huffington\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arianna Huffington</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one of those people. Even though she has some news, she likes it in a way which has got opinion in it, has a lot of context with it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My past brought me to my form, which is why I have struggled to write a book, mostly because I feel, this is how I like to write. I don&#8217;t know how to write a book. I like to read a book, and I find myself saying, &#8220;Get to it, guy. Why are you taking so long?&#8221; 85% of books are so badly written. I like the idea of not having finality to what I have written. Most people, their books are very final. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, this is it.&#8221; Things change. You look at a guy like John Legere—the guy who&#8217;s running T-Mobile now—his past is pretty colorful if you go back to his Global Crossing days, and who he was, and who he is. Not the same person, and yet, the same person. But if he was a hustler trying to get money out of big companies then, and now he&#8217;s getting interviewed from individual investors— the objectives are different, the thinking is different. So for me, I think this was my forum. And I don&#8217;t have any specific moment. I have things I’m proud about.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was proud to say goodbye to </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steve Jobs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in public. I was very proud to write about Skype being acquired by Microsoft because I spent ten years writing about Skype. I finally got my big story on Skype. They were always going to bigger publications. I like the fact that the thing which made blogging and my independent life as a writer/founder great was that we would do stories which we’d notice before everybody else. We were talking about the “Cloud” on my blog in like 2005 and now it&#8217;s all mainstream. Same as with data— data was something we were writing about in 2006. When GigaOM came about, we wrote about future of work and online video. I&#8217;m proud of the fact that we were always ahead of the curve on everything, but I can&#8217;t pick a single story. I&#8217;m very proud of all the people who came together. I think that is the lesser known topic on the history of GigaOm, the amazing talent who came together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think we were all people who got better because they worked with each other. I think a lot of places have star reporters and star writers and I think we were the star team. Each person made the other person 10x better. That is what I&#8217;m proud of. Soon it will all be forgotten, but in my heart, that&#8217;s what I think. We were a team that worked together for a very long time. The core team was pretty tight editorially. For me, that was the biggest, proudest part of my blogging per year, as we went from individual to a team. We had a lot of content. I heard a lot of stories. I interviewed a bunch of people. I wondered what was going to happen in the future. Even I&#8217;ve stopped doing aggressive writing like I&#8217;ve used to, mostly because my day job now is not being a blogger; it&#8217;s something else. I don&#8217;t know if I answered your question. It was a big ramble.</span></p>\n<p><b>You&#8217;re doing great. What&#8217;s it been like transitioning from journalism and blogging to VC?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Very different, right? Take a blogger and a journalist and no matter how much access you have, you&#8217;re still outside looking in. Inside looking out is very different. I think it is a much tougher realization I had when I became full-time VC. When I was I was part-time, it didn&#8217;t really matter as much, because I was traveling the two worlds and so it was pretty easy.  But now, being full time makes it much, much more explicit. Being an investor is a different kind of work and different kind of stress, as in it needs a different kind of mindset.</span></p>\n<p><b>Do the same things that excite and activate you as a journalist, excite and activate you as a VC?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. The core of why I&#8217;m drawn to it is technology and change. I think the motivations are different. Motivation as a writer are to tell a great story and then move on, and it&#8217;s like a motivation. It&#8217;s like having a flame, whereas investing is more like being in a relationship. You are with the company for a very long time, so you actually have to be very certain to commit when you make an investment in a company. Because it&#8217;s not an investment in a company, you&#8217;re investing in a relationship with the founders, you&#8217;re investing your time, you&#8217;re investing your emotional energy into something. And that leaves a very little time for all the other stuff, because that is the vector with which you look at your investment, whereas the  journalism world is a little easier. You don&#8217;t have to worry about running out of money. You don&#8217;t have to worry about having a tough conversation with the founder, trying to tell them that they&#8217;re screwing up or et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. You know what I mean? That is what I find is different. It&#8217;s definitely different kind of challenges. I have no problem with both. I still like to write. I want to write more, but I want to invest and find more companies as well. I think the challenge is that if you&#8217;re a journalism you can be more empathetic and more kind to people making mistakes and if you&#8217;re an investor, you have to be very direct with them. A lot of people don&#8217;t like it when you&#8217;re too direct. I made so many mistakes and I learned a lot from one of my board members who&#8217;s also my partner now, is John Callahan. It&#8217;s like, you can be direct and yet be human. So I aspire for that now. That&#8217;s like my way of dealing with it. It&#8217;s definitely an interesting tradition.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you think the culmination of your life experience, like growing up and all the years that you spent in journalism and blogging, how do you think that affects the way that you approach your work now, and makes you unique as an investor?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think because I grew up the way I did, I&#8217;m grateful more often than most people around here. Because my first was equivalent of 13 dollars in a month, so for me this is like I won the lottery of life. I feel that gives me a little bit more— I take a more philosophical view of everything. I think that&#8217;s been my approach, and I think a lot of it is because of my boss. I don&#8217;t have time to play games and all those things. You know what? If your aspiration in life is to only make money, then you can do that. I have a different aspiration. My view is that I think technology and change are important to society, and we should be thinking about that. I look at things which are important. I look at science, I look at technology, and not look at opportunistic pointless things to try and make a difference. Everybody says  if you want to invest by making a difference, and it&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t know. I mean, like, I like to think about it from a more philosophical standpoint. Like, are we really making a difference? Because most people think of it as a deal. I think of it as an opportunity. I think that&#8217;s — like, if you had to just sum it up, that&#8217;s&#8230; I look for opportunities, people look for deals. That&#8217;s my way of putting it.</span></p>\n<p><b>I love that. Let&#8217;s see, you&#8217;ve seen tech go through a couple of cycles now. I&#8217;m so curious how you&#8217;ve seen it change for better and for worse, and particularly culturally, and how you feel about the state of tech in 2016.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s a pretty broad question, so you&#8217;ll have to slice it.</span></p>\n<p><b>Let&#8217;s slice it then. How have you seen tech change as a culture since 2001?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think technology is now at the heart of everything. I kind of joke about this, but I think Silicon Valley has become the Babylon of the twenty-first century. And are we doing things right or wrong? I&#8217;ll let other people be the judge of that. I think we have a moral responsibility now I don&#8217;t think Tech ever had to think about it before. Like 2014 onwards I&#8217;ve been writing consistently about this. I think our moral obligation to society at large— society that can make decision based on what the future is right now. I think that is something that we need to be thinking about. Whether it is Facebook, Twitter, whomever— that&#8217;s the most important thing. I think Apple is standing there on it&#8217;s own and making a statement around privacy. And they&#8217;re not saying there&#8217;s privacy in encryption. It&#8217;s bad for business. And maybe it is and maybe it&#8217;s not, but I think it&#8217;s bad for humanity. Like if you are— if there are microphones and cameras in our homes all the time, do we even have a modicum of privacy? Are we human then? Aren&#8217;t we all living in a zoo at that point? It&#8217;s like, what&#8217;s the point? And I think there is a moral imperative to all technology, and I think it is time we better start talking about it and acting on it, right? That&#8217;s how I think about technology right now. That is the most important change. 2000, 2001—it was all about big companies and a few thing here and there accessing information on your website. Now we are squirrelly. Everything is happening because of tech now. The guys in the Middle East is fighting with the west though Twitter devices. You have spying happening through the Internet. There is a story on the US hacking into Iran&#8217;s infrastructure incase there was something weird going on. All those things tell you that every step you take, you use a phone to call in an order, you use a phone to order stuff from Amazon. There is very few things you do now which are not technology. Right? And so there is a moral imperative. I think that&#8217;s the biggest change. I think I wrote a piece in 2003 about Redheaded magazine shutting down and pointing to technology becoming completely consumer and pervasive in every way and that was the future and that future is here now. That&#8217;s technology today.  I think that&#8217;s where we are, right. And so I think it&#8217;s cool to be part of it but it&#8217;s important to be thinking about the larger, moral impact of what we’re doing here.</span></p>\n<p><b>With that in mind, how do you feel about the current tech ecosystem right now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, I don&#8217;t know about tech ecosystem. I feel like there is many, many ecosystems and there are some parts of the ecosystem which are somewhat unsettling and disturbing because we&#8217;ve never— I don&#8217;t know. I think there are some parts of it that I don&#8217;t like. I think— I&#8217;m trying to figure out how to describe this.</span></p>\n<p><b>Take your time.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a cultural aspect of it. And we don&#8217;t think before we speak. I think culturally, we&#8217;ve come to a point where we shoot before we ask questions and I think there&#8217;s a little bit of a Wild West mentality in the ecosystem. I think there needs to be a little bit more thoughtfulness. I think we also have challenges around intellectual leadership. There is guidance which takes into account the moral and societal obligations of technology. There&#8217;s a lot of talk about diversity in the Valley. And my view is not just as diversity. It&#8217;s diversity by race, diversity by gender, diversity by economic strata. Everybody just talks about their point of view without thinking that each thing has an impact on the other. And we&#8217;re talking about these things without a larger context of where our plan it is headed. It is good that we&#8217;re talking about diversity, and it&#8217;s good that we&#8217;re trying to— Numbers are only like half the story. It&#8217;s like, we&#8217;ve got to think about this bigger—just can&#8217;t be about the numbers, because we need to be about systematic change. I like what folks at Facebook are trying to do. They&#8217;re not talking about, &#8220;Let&#8217;s fix this problem.&#8221; It&#8217;s not an engineering hard fix. This is like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s develop a new system which is more open to the ideas from more people. And I think that is a longer process. It needs patience. It needs consistent education on all sides. More importantly, it needs action, not reaction, right? I&#8217;m very proud of the fact that my favorite part of GigaOM was that we had a huge number of employees who were women. And they were all— I then listened to all of them because they were just smarter than I was. Collectively we got better because of it as a team. It was not because I was playing some game of, &#8220;we should have more people.&#8221; It was just we should have more great people and they just happen to be of a different religion, or a different color, or a different gender, or a different race. And I think that diversity in the ecosystem is very important. It makes the ecosystem more resilient. It&#8217;s a scientifically proven fact that we need more varied people in the system. I don&#8217;t know, I look at myself as an example and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be here, but I am.&#8221; And I definitely am different than most people I know here. I know that, I have my own way of looking at the universe. I&#8217;m okay, but that&#8217;s how I see. That&#8217;s the ecosystem needs to evolve from better things— to be looking inward looking to a more outward looking ecosystem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know one of the things which I actually, what my mother is responsible for, is she worked very hard to put me through college— through school and college. Just like my dad, but my mom worked extra hard. She did tuition and stuff like that and took her own extra money to put the kids through college. And I think for me that has had a much more of a lasting impact. It was like she&#8217;s no Sheryl Sandberg in terms of being famous and everything, but I find her more inspirational than Sheryl Sandberg just for that reason. She lived with in a society which had very little room for women who worked and stuff like that and she managed to put me where I am. I think that&#8217;s very important for me. It had a way longer— like that&#8217;s what I mean the long term it that I saw her do all those things and I realized, &#8220;Well, you know, she&#8217;s actually pretty smart.&#8221; That&#8217;s why I am here, right? If she hadn&#8217;t pushed me to study, then pushed me to go to a better school and a better college and paid for it, I wouldn&#8217;t be here. That kind of tells you everything, right? That&#8217;s how you should be thinking, because she was very different than my father. My father was not that person. As a child, you learn a lot about your people from your parents. And I think, similarly, when I came here, more editors I encountered who were open to me, the more open I am to other people because of that. You only learn from people. When I say we have to take the long-term, let&#8217;s not focus just purely on numbers, but focus on actually inspiring people to think about the subsequent generations. In my case, it was my editors. I got some really great editors. They couldn&#8217;t give a shit how funny my accent is. As long as I got them the story which mattered. There were always positive. And I think there&#8217;s a lot of people who would not, and I remembered that. And I remembered to avoid that mistake. Half like New York establishment— I never got a job offer from any of the big publications. Forget job offer, I never even got a call back from any of the big publications. Even today. For me, the path has been on my own. And that&#8217;s the challenge of our ecosystem. Is that most of the thing we will need to do is to inspire people to make right decisions five years from now. And we had to start a systematic change, not just numbers but also make people think different.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do I want to take it from here? I&#8217;m curious to know what your priorities are in 2016 and what you&#8217;re working on either for for work or for yourself.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work things, I&#8217;m focused entirely on finding some interesting new companies to work with. I&#8217;m interested in writing more regularly. I promised myself that I would write every day and so far I&#8217;ve written— it&#8217;s 50 days into the new year and I&#8217;ve only written 30 times, so I&#8217;m falling behind on that [chuckles]. That&#8217;s it. Then I have a personal project called PI.CO, which is where I interview interesting people. I want to interview 25 interesting people this year. So far, so good. I&#8217;m on top of it for that. </span></p>\n<p><b>What, as a VC right now, what are are you looking for—it could just be conceptually—in a company that you&#8217;d want to invest in in a year like this?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t care what the market is doing, I look for companies which are using technology to solve a great problem. And my preference is for companies with technologies which are more behind the scenes—sort of like networks, and sensors, and stuff like that—but nothing has changed for me. Last year I made only three investments and in the year before it was two. So I&#8217;m not rushing out to spend a lot of money. I am looking for a company that I would like to work with. I look for opportunities— and my personal belief is that there is going to be need for software which helps us live better. Because as humans, we are soon going to come to the limit of our ability to live with the world around us because of data and technology. So we will need another layer— just like Google helped us figure out how to find things on the Web, and Facebook figured out how to rearrange our relationships,  there will be new software which will allow us to just exist smartly in the universe and I&#8217;m interested in that aspect of technology. People are talking about artificial intelligence and stuff and my view is before we get to the Skynet, we will get to augmented intelligence where we need the software to help us make better decisions. So that&#8217;s where my focus is right now.</span></p>\n<p><b>And then, as far as Pi.co, what kind of people do you gravitate towards the interview?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, a lot of photographers. I think photography, visual culture is going through change. I&#8217;m going to talk to a bunch of scientists in this year. I&#8217;m interested in talking to more in a smaller fashion people, trends, like you know, people— I just did the piece on this young blogger called Julie Zerbo, she runs the Fashion Law and she writes about fast fashion and stuff like that. So I&#8217;m interested in that, maybe I&#8217;ll interview some economist and stuff like that. I mean, I&#8217;m just looking for people who are at the nexus of today and tomorrow, people who are predicting the change. That&#8217;s what is very interesting to me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And I don&#8217;t know, for some odd reason, I like talking to photographers. I might start a Twitter feed just linking some of my favorite photography oriented articles and stuff I read. I read a lot about photography. And I don&#8217;t think of photography as just photography, but more as what other possibles of camera sensors everywhere.</span></p>\n<p><b>Okay, last question. What advice or major lessons would you have to share with someone who has a similar background to you and is hoping to get into tech. What advice would you have for them based on what you&#8217;ve learned about yourself?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think every time somebody said no to me, I tried to figure out why did they say no. No is fine, rejections are fine, but you use the no to calibrate why. That means having to take no graciously. I think it&#8217;s pretty painful to say no to somebody, as much as it is to take a no.</span></p>\n<p>The advice i have for anyone, whoever they are. If you believe in something, you&#8217;ve got to go for it. Don&#8217;t worry about the consequences. Don&#8217;t worry about the financial outcome, or how famous you&#8217;re gonna get, or how poor you will be. If you believe and you can&#8217;t seem to do anything other than think about something, you&#8217;ve just got to keep doing it. I think the universe has to follow. What&#8217;s the point of living if you don&#8217;t chase what&#8217;s important to you? That&#8217;s how I see it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

That&#8217; s where I grew up and went through the most awkward part of everyone&#8217;s lives, and then moved to Philadelphia for college. That&#8217;s the short story. 10 years later I moved to San Francisco for work.</span></p>\n<p><b>Alright, let&#8217;s dig in. What was spending your first nine years in the Philippines like?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was wild! I mean, I had nothing to compare it to, right? I was expecting everything to be that way. I went to a Catholic private school—all boys. So, just to jump ahead really quickly, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when my parents moved me to New Jersey in third grade, it was the first time I shared a classroom with women, and I was flipping out, I was like, &#8220;what is this?&#8221; I was also just the only brown kid in class, so it was doubly weird. It was like, I don&#8217;t know what to do, and I&#8217;ve got this really thick accent but I&#8217;m also really good at everything, like how does this play out? Why can I do math that these kids can&#8217;t do?</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It&#8217;s hard to explain. It was just like I had—I was forced to memorize everything. Growing up in the Philippines, you go to Catholic school, they teach religion, and science, and math all at once. So, I never really distinguished one from the other.</span></p>\n<p><b>Interesting</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. So, you&#8217;re doing your weird math equations, and also memorizing prayers in Latin the next class. And I remember certain classes where I got into a lot of trouble because I would just keep asking a lot of questions. It was specifically the religious ones. They would tell us the difference between heaven, and hell and I was like, &#8220;Yeah, but what happens if? What</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">if you do this? Is it still that black and white?&#8221; Looking back, what I really wanted was this philosophical back and forth, but I didn&#8217;t get that as a kid. Everyone just told me, &#8220;No. Just deal with it.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><b>I remember that growing up.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s frustrating, but I didn&#8217;t really know how to process that until later.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s other stuff that I was going through in my childhood as well. I remember a volcano erupting—an hour and a half from my house, and I think. I think it was 1991. Mount Pinatubo erupted around my mother&#8217;s birthday. And I remember having to go to school the next week, everyone&#8217;s desks covered in ash and we had to wear face masks to keep from breathing it in. Since it&#8217;s that close, the ash from the volcano finds its way inside of everything, even containers of food inside the fridge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What else&#8230; Just 5 years before that my parents were involved in [chuckles]— I don&#8217;t know what to call them. I guess they&#8217;re like political rallies? I wasn&#8217;t conscious enough to know what I was doing there, but I knew that it had something to do with a revolution. This is going back to 1986. The “People Power Revolution”. The country was under Martial Law, it was pretty oppressive, and my whole family was on the side fighting to overthrow the Marcos regime. It was the right side to be on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of my mom&#8217;s favorite photos is of me sitting on her lap, with my thumb and forefinger making an “L” at the camera. “L” stands for the word “</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">laban,”</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which translates to “fight” in Tagalog.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately I don&#8217;t know a lot of details about it other than I think there was just one anecdote my mom likes to tell. She brought us to—her and my dad brought me to this big crowd. Might have been a demonstration but—like tied me to a tree so that I couldn&#8217;t get lost or get kidnapped or something.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was sort of like a hack. You&#8217;re trying to just like make sure that this wild little runt doesn&#8217;t get away. Kinda like how you might park your dog outside of Bi-Rite.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[laughter]</span></p>\n<p><b>The life of an activist baby.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess! They didn&#8217;t have those slings you would have in The Hangover.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[laughter]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like, strap me to your chest, geez. [laughter] I&#8217;m joking, I&#8217;m sure I was probably too big to be in a sling anyhow since I would have been two years old.</span></p>\n<p><b>When was the moment when you realized your background was unique in a new context?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transitioning into suburban American life was strange. I didn&#8217;t understand it. You had shows like Boy Meets World, Saved By The Bell, this show Clarissa Explains It All&#8230; and it seems cool, but what&#8217;s with this guy walking through the window to her bedroom to a guitar riff? How is that ok? I didn&#8217;t understand that this was meant to be “normal.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I really had hard time making friends, because I had different experiences to draw from didn&#8217;t have much explanation. My parents went through the same stuff, so they were in the same boat trying to adjust and determine how to fit in as immigrants.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>Why did they move if you were all there in the first place?</b></p>\n<p>No doubt, this idea of the American dream, and having more opportunities.</p>\n<p><b>How did they adjust?</b></p>\n<p>My dad adjusted pretty well. He moved ahead of us for two years, and during that time my mom had like three jobs, and I was in school. I didn&#8217;t see her much, because she was teaching and she was working at this ad agency, and my dad was overseas trying to settle down and get a good job. He bounced around from California to New York, and ended up in New Jersey. And finally when he had it on lock, he was like, &#8220;Alright. It&#8217;s lit fam, come through.&#8221;</p>\n<p><b>In those exact words I’m assuming?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exactly how he said it. [laughter] He&#8217;d would never say that.</span></p>\n<p><b>When did you first realize you were a creative kid?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since my mom worked a lot, I had a lot of time to myself in the Philippines.</span> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And I think a lot of that creative energy came from not being allowed to go outside the walls of my house. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure, I had a yard and was allowed to run around it. And this part I&#8217;m usually careful about explaining. Because as soon as I start saying like, &#8221;We had drivers, and nannies, and people who took care of me.&#8221; It sounds like I grew up wealthy, but that&#8217;s not the case. I think it&#8217;s pretty average. It&#8217;s a different type of middle class suburbia, my childhood setup in the Philippines.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My only good friend in the Philippines was this German kid. That was it [chuckles]. We would pretend we were like astronauts, or super soldiers, or superheroes. Normal kid stuff, but it required an extremely active imagination since my TV only had 2 channels and didn&#8217;t have anywhere to go.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also used a lot of that time to put things together. For example </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was fascinated by the concept of a pinball machine. I&#8217;d never seen one in person, so I started making them out of cardboard. And I would put on magic shows and plays and hire my little brother as the help.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> He was terrible at it of course.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn&#8217;t until much later, in high school, where I realized all that creative energy made sense as art. I had a way to channel it. And it was going well enough that I thought I had a career in fine art. Wanted to go to school for painting, that&#8217;s what brought me to Philadelphia.</span></p>\n<p><b>Tell me about your early work experience, like you started your own company, you worked in the music scene. Walk me through those first years.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was kind of accidental. Like everyone else, I had no idea what I wanted to do. At this point I was enrolled in a graphic design program, fresh out of a ska band I used to be the singer for in high school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had a lot of experience working with friends and other bands designing a ton of merch and eventually websites too. It carried on during college at Drexel University, as a means of making extra spending cash. It was a steady flow of work, and eventually it led to having contracts with people at record labels and management companies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Drexel, your junior year includes a 6-month co-op/internship program at a real job. My classmates all ended up getting jobs at print studios and ad agencies, but since I was already working out of my dorm room making websites I decided maybe this is an opportunity to go legit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s when I set up—are you ready for this early 2000&#8217;s nerdy-ass name?—I created a design studio called </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shiftcore. Instead of interning somewhere, I started a company.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> At the time my business partner was actually a former client, someone who manages musicians. I decided it made sense for him to manage me, and the administrative part of the business too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I worked with Drive Thru Records. You might remember them from bands like New Found Glory, Midtown, Something Corporate, The Starting Line, Houston Calls&#8230; There was a time I was working with Fueled By Ramen, and Crush Management, who at time had just signed Fall Out Boy, Paramore, and The Academy Is. Of course they hadn&#8217;t yet become as big as they would go on to be, but at the time it was fun to build their promotional Flash websites and online music players, designing shirts and album art whenever I was asked.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a sole proprietor and having 3-4 contractors forced me to grow. I had to learn a ton of things on my own. And it was a very messy time to be building MySpace pages and websites.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was really exciting! While the work was steady and I enjoyed starting a ton of new projects often I had no idea how much I should be getting paid. I was extremely bad at calculating how much things cost.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One time this band called Armor For Sleep paid $65 for a shirt design. I was told it&#8217;d only be used for their tour, so I figured sure why not. 3 months later I was on vacation in Hawaii with my family and I saw it hanging at a Hot Topic. They sell for $30 a shirt. Come to think of it, each shirt also sells for $15 at a show, so you can imagine what I got paid was nothing compared to how many shirts were eventually sold. I didn&#8217;t make that mistake again.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking back, I definitely failed a lot! I would miss deadlines and meetings, because it&#8217;s college and everyone parties, I lacked discipline. That was probably the most challenging part, something I didn&#8217;t realize I was going to suck at.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shiftcore</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> shut down a year after I graduated from college. By then I had a full time job at an online treadmill retailer as their “web designer.” I don&#8217;t need to explain why it was terrible, but imagine a room of car salesmen telling you how to design something, and how the internet works, and try not to roll your eyes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They fired me when they outsourced my job to a company in China. My morale was super low. If you can believe it, it was extremely difficult to find a tech job in Philadelphia at the time—so I was unemployed for close to a year. In that time I was a dog walker, prison zombie, production artist, etc. Just trying to keep busy mostly because it&#8217;s important to have that hustle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually I started over. I started </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big Red Tank</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with one of my friends. I promised myself that this time would be different, that I would be much more thoughtful and intentional about the work, and that I wouldn&#8217;t take things for granted. Though I was still inexperienced, I definitely had that spark.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of our size—two people—and because we were looking for full-time jobs during the day we decided that this business model was only going to fly if we focused on one project at a time. And this went on for a few years, as a side hustle to our day jobs working at agencies and studios.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While that was happening, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was offered a job to work at QVC. This was around 2010. You know, primary competitor to the Home Shopping Network. Where you can buy things you see on TV by picking up a phone.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I was one of two original members of the team that designed their mobile shopping apps. I had to line up for an iPhone not because I wanted to, but because I needed to have it to do my job and I didn&#8217;t think the company really understood where the market was going just yet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two years later, I ended up working at a very progressive digital agency in South Philadelphia. This was where I really solidified my connection to the heart of Philadelphia. It was a house on the corner of Federal St. and Passyunk Ave. The agency is called P&#8217;unk Ave, as an ode to its own address, but also because of its ideals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">P&#8217;unk&#8217;s mission is to do good work for good people. But in order to do that sometimes you have to create new products, new paths forward, and that was a pretty punk rock attitude to have. It was very a very good fit for me, and my history working with people in music. It really jived with my overall ethos and outlook, and they value autonomy and mastery, which is all about doing what you have to do to do good work.</span></p>\n<p><b>Interesting. I feel similarity to you, I think, in that I&#8217;m very stubborn about what I want to do and what I find a waste of time, which is why I didn’t go to college much.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, same.</span></p>\n<p><b>And I&#8217;m wondering if that stubbornness of just doing what you want to do is why you had that entrepreneurial bug so early. Basically what I’m getting at is—why in the world did you start those companies so early and so young?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I suppose that is a curious thing! I mean, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I didn&#8217;t set out to do it to be a CEO of anything, and I didn&#8217;t care so much about owning or running a company. I definitely had issues with authority and being told what to do so I figured why not just be my own boss?</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &lt;laughing&gt; And that&#8217;s probably why I failed at it. I didn&#8217;t approach it as a business, I approached it as a project.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I didn&#8217;t have a plan. In order to keep the lights on, I had to design. I had to create, and I really just needed to make sure I had next month’s rent. And for me, on paper that was like three projects.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Really short-sighted. It took a long time to kind of break out of that, but I suppose that is the way it goes if you have so much ego and pride that keeps you from seeking help and mentorship.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. In the meantime you were getting super involved in the Philly scene, like the tech scene.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right, we didn&#8217;t have one.</span></p>\n<p><b>Tell me more about that.</b></p>\n<p>In 2007, one of my best friends (now a published author and literary agent, Eric Smith) was the online content coordinator for GPTMC, so it&#8217;s Greater Philadelphia Tourism and Marketing Company. And they had a website called Uwishunu, it was a blog for things that were worth checking out in the city. I think it was a good position for him to be in because he had just moved to Philadelphia pretty recently was discovering things about the city on his own. He had a lot to write about.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for myself, my day job at that treadmill company had me commuting an hour and a half west of the city, so I rarely spent time in the city. I craved a community of likeminded people. I also had a lot of free time at work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So because of this we started a blog called </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Geekadelphia.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This blog was our outlet to kind of talk about the things we were interested in. I was very interested in being a stormtrooper at the time. I was a registered stormtrooper for the 501st Legion, shadow trooper TX-5882.</span></p>\n<p><b>Huh</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you familiar with them at all? No? I&#8217;ll just show you what that looks like. Here, I have a picture in my phone of me with my armor at work. I just posted this to Instagram a week ago.</span></p>\n<p><b>Are you kidding me?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[laughs]</span></p>\n<p><b>Oh my God.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s a non profit costuming organization, obviously Star Wars related. As the 501st, we would participate in parades, comic conventions, charity walks, children&#8217;s hospital visits. The armor and costumes we built were cannon. It was only out of the movies and what was official in terms of story line, using the same techniques used in the 70s.</span></p>\n<p><b>Wow.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vacuum formed objects, all the fabric stuff is stitched together because there was just stuff you couldn&#8217;t find in stores. So, I built that suit myself, I built two of them. Having built an “accurate” one was the price of admission to get into the organization. In order to be a member, you had to have an approved costume. So, I was writing about that process on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Geekadelphia</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And Eric would also film me walking around Philadelphia in my armor. &lt;laughs&gt; Pretty compelling content right?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But you can imagine the type of people that were interested in engaging with this. We struck a chord with a lot of likeminded people. All of a sudden there was a website that talked about geek/nerd tech related things in Philadelphia. And then the Twitter account followed. Everything from a screening of the Battlestar Galactica finale (complete with a cake shaped like a battlestar) to comic conventions in the area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This, to my knowledge and complete surprise, hadn&#8217;t existed before. On more than one occasion, local news came to Eric&#8217;s house to interview us. After 2 years of this, we were picked by Ford motor company to represent Philadelphia in a marketing campaign for the newly relaunched Ford Fiesta, in the style of a YouTube-driven reality series.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure, it started with pop-culture, Star Wars, Halo, and video games&#8230; but quickly expanded to coverage of game companies like Cipher Prime&#8230;co-working offices like Indy Hall (which preceded WeWork)&#8230; and startups like Curalate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We realized eventually that something was happening. The community we had been building was starting to do really crazy (and socially good) things, so we wanted to recognize them. We put on an awards show. What would a website called </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Geekadelphia</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> call it? The Philadelphia Geek Awards, of course.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We honored scientists, teachers, students, hackers, designers, comedians, artists, civic leaders and it seemed like all of it was overlapping with technology. And we intentionally focused on projects that were good for people of the city.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, and it was a black tie affair. The fanciest attire was encouraged. As geeks we never really had a reason to dress up the way they do on the Hollywood red carpet so why not create a reason?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The setting for this It was the Academy of Natural Sciences, along the Parkway. It&#8217;s a great part of the city where all the museums are. It&#8217;s dignified and central, easy to get to and easily memorable. Of course we had no budget the first time around. We called in so many favors that year, and Eric and I spent our own money to get things done. But it was spectacular, I mean cocktail hour with dinosaur skeletons hanging out next to you and dioramas of cavemen? That was fun. We kept hosting it there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of its success, we had great relationships with the Academy and others in the tech community. It became one of the marquee events every year in Philadelphia. Our planning committee went from 2 people to 8 or so. It&#8217;s a lot of work! I don&#8217;t run it anymore. In addition to being the co-host and one of the main panel judges, I was the art director, so I would do all of the visuals (branding/identity), and the design of the show itself with the help of killer visual effects by friends I contracted.</span></p>\n<p><b>What was it like building all of that stuff for your community and then ditching? Moving across the country?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was painful. I wrote about it when I left. It was something that was—I had done all of these things, not for myself, but it ended up defining who I was in Philadelphia. Leaving that felt almost as if I was leaving part of myself behind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leaving everything I was invested in. Coming here to only do one job. That was hard.</span></p>\n<p><b>What brought you to Silicon Valley?</b></p>\n<p>I met a few people at Brooklyn Beta in 2013. It was a good event. In terms of conferences, especially in the design community, this one felt very warm, like a family gathering of all the people you&#8217;ve worked with, and their friends.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like any good attendee I made it to some drinking events, and was invited to a FB house party.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you know Joey Flynn?</span></p>\n<p><b>Yep!</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So me, my boss and Joey were just talking in the back yard about football for like an hour and a half, and I was like, &#8220;Oh, man, these Facebook people are super chill.&#8221; I remember Barton Smith was there, along with Austin Bales, and a couple of other folks that I became friends with later on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I started the application process kind of in the back of my head knowing, &#8220;Listen, I&#8217;m just going to take a chance.&#8221; I never really thought in my dreams that this could ever happen or that I would be hired by Facebook, but these folks seem like they&#8217;re on the same level about doing good things and we think the same way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if I was happy in Philadelphia I was curious to see if this was even possible. I also wanted to work in the product space, instead of client services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then when I went in for my onsite interview. I feel like I bombed my presentation, maybe being overly critical here. [laugh]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The interviews went really well. I think despite the fact that I was really nervous, I think that one on one conversations with people was the reason I got the offer. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was also restless. I loved starting new things, and I didn&#8217;t require instructions. I liked solving problems and having so many constraints along the way made me really scrappy.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>What were your first impressions of Silicon Valley?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, I hated it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[laugh]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was terrible. I had a 12 minute bicycle commute in Philadelphia. Working at Facebook takes me outside the city—they have to shuttle us in this prison bus for like an hour and a half just to get to work and then once you&#8217;re there you&#8217;re bombarded with data, information, conversation, and really hard challenges. The job is to parse this as best you can and figure out the best solution as fast as possible&#8230; and then go home on that same prison bus in a city that you don&#8217;t know anything about. A city that doesn&#8217;t know who you are, and couldn&#8217;t care less. You&#8217;re new in town, working in tech like everyone else.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving here was one of the hardest things I&#8217;ve ever had to do. And it&#8217;s not the act of moving that was hard, I&#8217;ve moved more than 10 times in the last 10 years. It&#8217;s what happened after I moved that was difficult to get through.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went through a rough break up a year after moving here. I was engaged when I moved to SF, and my fiancee and I were living together for only a year before that so we were still trying to figure out how to be around each other that much.</span></p>\n<p>Adjusting to a new city, starting over completely without our friends, all of this forced us to deal with our hangups with ourselves and each other and when it came to its conclusion&#8230; I was left feeling like moving here was almost a mistake.</p>\n<p><b>Wow. That&#8217;s really intense.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So that was kind of the culmination of my displeasure with Silicon Valley. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was like, &#8220;Fuck this place.&#8221; Not only did I give up everything that had made me happy—I was struggling with proving myself again and neglecting a lot of what my relationship needed.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I&#8217;m glad I don&#8217;t feel that way now.</span></p>\n<p><b>How did you turn it around? Where did you find support networks? What did you have to do?</b></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had started to form this group of friends at work who were also pretty weird on their own. They had quirks. I liked that they were different from the typical white male stereotype of Silicon Valley. It made me comfortable and helped me feel like I belong because of their differences. If they were extras on Men in Black you might think they are aliens. That kind of people.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It made me happier to know that these people who are equally smart and talented as everyone else in Silicon Valley have these things that drive them to be so unique and so wierd. I just wanted to be with them more. So our group of friends was my support network. As a joke we call ourselves Brick Squad.</span></p>\n<p><b>Oh man. Waka is my biggest rap crush.</b></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So things started to pick up from there. That&#8217;s great. It may be different now than it was then but what excites you about your work? What activates you?</span></i></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s funny. The work that I do now was self-initiated. We didn&#8217;t have a music team on Facebook. I joined this Hackathon (a Facebook event where you get to build whatever you want) in January of last year, and answered a request by a team asking what if you were able to express who you were through the music that you listen to&#8230;to your friends on Facebook.</p>\n<p>It seems simple, right? Like, you should be able to do this easily, but we discovered that there were a number of things preventing us from doing so. We don&#8217;t have to go into the details right now but the important part about being to express yourself through music is having someone know what it sounds like. So when you share that Bruno Mars song I should be able to listen to it so that I can understand what you&#8217;re talking about. Yea, sure I could open Spotify or iTunes and look for the song, but I&#8217;m talking about listening to the song in that moment, when you&#8217;re reading the post itself.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, normally the team that gets together during a hackathon builds a prototype of the idea overnight, so that we can present it to everyone else the next week. In this case, there were so many difficult business/legal logistics to tackle that we had to start with the most fluid concept &#8211; which required prototyping an interactive demo as fast as possible. For me, at that time, that meant using Apple&#8217;s Keynote to animate everything.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long story short, the demo resonated with people. Eventually one of the PM&#8217;s I worked with that night would go on to show this work to Mark in person, and that set the wheels in motion for our team to come together. I came back to be the sole designer for this full-time, launched our first product 6 months later, and here we are a year after it started!</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. And that worked out great.</b></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m lucky, yeah. And I redeemed my sanity after that because I had something that I cared about emotionally that I could really devote my time and attention to.</p>\n<p><b>Let&#8217;s see. You talked a bit about your otherness as a child moving to Jersey. I&#8217;m curious how that&#8217;s continued to manifest through your career and then here in Silicon Valley. I know how I feel otherness, I&#8217;m curious to know how you feel otherness here.</b></p>\n<p>What do you mean by otherness? What does that mean?</p>\n<p><b>For me, personally, in tech it was like—where are the other me&#8217;s? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah&#8211;</span></p>\n<p><b>Where are people who came from small redneck towns and didn&#8217;t go to good schools and don&#8217;t have money. Like where are those people?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t have a pedigree. Like I didn&#8217;t go to U-Penn, I didn&#8217;t go to CMU which has some of the best programs for what we do in product design. I wasn&#8217;t disciplined, you know? I partied too hard, I drank too much. I just didn&#8217;t see things the same way that I do now.</span></i> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course I still do some of that, but my job comes first. I&#8217;ve got to do it well so that I can provide a thing that serves people, and that makes me feel good about why I do what I do.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As far as finding other people, I went back to how I did that in Philadelphia. It was a matter of respecting other people&#8217;s efforts and projects and just getting to know them. Acknowledging that they exist in tandem with what you&#8217;re doing. Because, if I had these questions, it was inevitable that other people had the same ones. I started mentoring—I started managing actually.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I became Product Design Manager at Facebook for like eight months. I started going to—we have boot camp. I would take them out to lunch. Almost every new designer that came through for like a solid ten months, I had interacted with them at some point in time. I just put myself at the top of the funnel, meeting as many people as I could. I knew there had to be other people like me.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? What is exciting to you and what frustrates you?</b></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What excites me about it is how intentional our efforts are about making sure that what we do is useful for people, and helps people.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We&#8217;re not building trinkets, at least I don&#8217;t think we are. I don&#8217;t believe that we build things just because they&#8217;re fun. There&#8217;s always room for that and we should allow for that to happen, but that shouldn&#8217;t be the only thing we do. If the main thing we do is like make a joke website, I might rethink it.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But if the main thing we do is to protect and serve a way for people to really connect and have a voice, that&#8217;s an outstanding goal. And I think we&#8217;ve all kind of matured as an industry—It&#8217;s nice to see that more and rely on a strong moral compass.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More and more people that we work with are having kids, getting married, and they&#8217;re starting to see life differently. I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s not just about building another cool app.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. For sure. How do you think that your background and all of your life experiences impact the way that you approach your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, that&#8217;s a good question. Well, it might sound trite, but </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can always wonder like if the thing that I&#8217;m creating, does this bring value to somebody across the world, like my aunt who&#8217;s still living in the Philippines, would she care about this–does this even matter to her at all?</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If her answer&#8217;s yes, then I think I&#8217;m heading in the right direction. And then there&#8217;s all the things that I&#8217;ve tried and have failed at, that help me understand how to make decisions and not be so reckless.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So that&#8217;s always helped, and I think that&#8217;s the result of having so many different jobs and so many different side hustles in Philadelphia.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was a Stormtrooper and I was also a zombie at Eastern State Penitentiary, and I walked dogs for an entire summer. I was jobless for a year; I was an intern at an creative agency, undergrad adjunct professor, awards show co-host and producer&#8230;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whew. Product design is my only job right now, I&#8217;m so used to having so many all at once! And </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve held many different roles and have moved to a lot of different places, and I think that has given me the ability to empathize and understand. Yea that helps with the work that I do, but it also makes me a better human being I think.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in five or ten years? Do you think you&#8217;ll still be here?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I&#8217;ll still be in — well, no, I think I&#8217;ll still be working in Tech but it will probably be back in the East Coast.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like I belong in the East Coast and I don&#8217;t consider myself a Californian. As much as I really love the landscape, beauty, and weather I miss being in the company of others like me back East. I followed the work here, after all. Perhaps it was what I needed to do in order to more fully realize where I wanted to go.</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m curious to know your thoughts on how other cities could better adopt tech and tech could better adopt other cities. Does that make sense?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think it has to come from wanting to solve a problem in that place, right?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we want tech to be more of a focus, we would probably need to address the shortcomings of that city or place and then use tech as a tool to solve them. In doing that we would get different groups, organizations, businesses working together to adopt tech into that solution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier in my career I would keep running into dead ends whenever I wanted to push tech as a way to solve business or civic problems. Eventually I was able to find the right people to help me push with it, and with each scenario the results spoke for themselves.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think New York City and Philadelphia are really good at this. Sometimes it&#8217;s because the people in the position to move tech forward are also working in city hall or are also in charge of education in schools. So if they want better opportunities for tech to grow in Philadelphia, they need to accept that it is challenging, there will be people that disagree, and that&#8217;s okay but it can definitely work.</span></p>\n<p><b>What advice would you have for folks of similar backgrounds who are hoping to get in tech, or just work on something that they really love? What do you wish you&#8217;d known in the beginning?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I wish I&#8217;d known? I wish I had known to get over myself earlier. Wish I&#8217;d exhibit more humility and asked for help.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because I&#8217;m good at something doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s enough. It&#8217;s just one part of it. Being good at something is not what makes you a good person, it&#8217;s not what makes you a good collaborator, team player, or leader. It doesn&#8217;t give you real friends.</span></i></p>\n<p>I think if I had known that earlier, I would have been better off, and not made as many mistakes maybe? But I don&#8217;t know, on the other hand I really like having made those mistakes, now in hindsight [chuckles].</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>So, let&#8217;s start from the beginning. Tell me a little bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I grew up in National City, about 15 miles north of the border in San Diego. It’s predominantly Mexican-Filipino neighborhood, which is great because our family is super diverse. Mexican, white, filipino, a little of everything. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I grew up poor with divorced parents, Welfare family, zero dollars. However poor we were, my family maintained strong values. Mom cared about church, the arts, and education. She wanted to see good in the world. We grew up with this contrasting view that from within a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rough neighborhood </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">people really believed the world is a beautiful place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I moved to San Francisco for college to study industrial design. My dream was to make really cool plastic products. I knew I needed to be a maker. I had to go away to school because my sister was expecting her first child and needed space in the house to raise him. A mix of interest, affordability, and distance made SFSU the right choice. I had never visited the school or city. I just made my choices and packed my bags. That’s how my life in San Francisco got started—in totally blind faith. </span></p>\n<p><b>What were your first years in San Francisco like? Were you at all cognizant of the Silicon Valley tech machine, or were you in your own academic world, or just trying to survive?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A little bit of everything you just said. When I first arrived, I was paying for my own education which resulted in full-time school and two jobs. I was working at Lori&#8217;s Diner serving burgers to drunk people on the night shift. During the week and on weekends I sold sequined cocktail dresses at French Connection. Looking back, I should have doubled down on school and not work. Sweat equity is all I knew. In my sophomore year of school, at the bottom of the recession, I needed to get out of the craziness that was two jobs and school, so I took a full-time product distribution job with Apple</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8230;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and so it began. </span></p>\n<p><b>Wow. So, you have gone from that to industrial design to startup land. Walk me through that whole winding course.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the recession my school went bankrupt, cutting my program. I didn&#8217;t finish industrial design school, but I had gotten far enough to know something about the industry. I knew the different facets of the discipline and I knew I could hustle. I worked for the world&#8217;s leading industrial design firm, Apple Inc. I had a good job and school wasn&#8217;t really feeding me as much as work, so I took the path of growth and fully committed to work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had tunnel-vision for work. I worked as hard as I could to get promoted, get raises, and take over bigger parts of the business to the point where I was coaching new hires on how to optimize their warehouses and their workflows, how to save the company money, and how to just do smarter business. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three years in, I got married and moved to San Diego. Within a year, I was divorced and on my way back to San Francisco. I was young and career thirsty, and didn’t want to have an ok life in San Diego. I wanted a great life in San Francisco. I’ve always been fiercely independent and felt that I had to defend that through career and identity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon returning to San Francisco, I stayed with Apple two more quarters. I was going through a personal rebuild and wanted to continue to grow. I was recruited to join Tiffany &amp; Co. by someone I admired, someone who I thought would build me up—so I took the leap. No more than a year in at Tiffany’s, an old colleague from Apple gave me a call. They had just joined the marketing team at a tiny startup called Square. I came over to the office for lunch, saw the electricity across the team, and knew I needed to join. That was the moment I got on the rocketship, so to speak. </span></p>\n<p><b>So you were a very early employee at Square. What is it like going from little startup to IPO?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s kind of insane, and it’s hard to say succinctly. I was a 100th hire. I&#8217;ve worked on everything from support to product, to product marketing, growth, even HR. The company has grown from small and scrappy to a big global organization. My focus has always been to build the business, to work on undefined problems. I will say that every ounce of energy I’ve put into building the company is exactly what I’ve gotten out of it. I joined the company with the intent of building something good in the world. That’s still the goal and there is still a lot of work to do.</span></p>\n<p><b>What in general have been the most exciting things about your work? What things were you really proud of and what activated you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve spent the past five years building tools for people who are not accounted for by standard banking systems. I’ve had the privilege of working directly with small businesses, getting to know them and their life stories, their philosophy, and their hustle and everything that they put into their business just so that we could build the right product for them. I have made connections with letterpress artists in Greenville, SC to surf shops in New York City to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a family</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> run bar in Austin, TX. It’s changed my view of what the American Dream is today. Small businesses are much like startups in the way sweat and scrappiness get the job done. It’s been such an important life experience that has colored my view of the amazing entrepreneurial world we live in.</span></p>\n<p><b>Do you think you have some sort of quality, some sort of personality trait that has allowed you to take on, blind challenges? You just do it, and own it, and end up doing it really well. Where does that come from?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you come from nothing, you have nothing to lose. Because I don’t have your typical pedigree, I have to maintain a constant state of learning. Beginner&#8217;s mind! I have design sensibilities, but I&#8217;m strong with business operations and strategy. I&#8217;m not an expert at anything, but I&#8217;m not allergic to anything either. If you acknowledge that, you ask the right questions, and you&#8217;re willing to learn while you&#8217;re making things happen. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People around you will invest in you. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People will answer the questions you have if you&#8217;re brave enough to ask them.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Know that&#8217;s the hardest part, acknowledging what you don&#8217;t know and be willing to learn – it might also have something to do with the fact that I am an INTJ.</span></p>\n<p><b>When did you turn your attention towards the community? You manage a really successful event in the tech design world. What was the impetus?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community building, for me, is the idea that</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you can always build the city you want to live in</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There is a lot of commentary on what&#8217;s happening in San Francisco—tech bros versus artists versus families. There are these stereotypes that the media loves to commonly use as if they&#8217;re not living in a city of diverse people with diverse problems and perspectives. I believe if you want to see more art galleries, you should open an art gallery. If you want to see more artists in San Francisco, you should definitely patronize artists. If you want to see more women in tech, hire them. If you want to build a community—a safe community where people can come and be their nerdy little selves and eat pizza and make new friends and wear name tags and talk about your ideas every month—you&#8217;ve got to kind of create that space for yourself if it&#8217;s not already there for you. Be the change! That’s what Designers + Geeks, the conferences, Room &amp; Makers, everything I’ve had a hand in building has been in service of—building the community I want to live in.</span></p>\n<p><b>Have you seen tech culture change since you&#8217;ve started your career, for better or worse?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are more voices in the echo chamber than ever before. Headlines used to be about what people were doing to make the world a better place. What people were building. What people were enabling other people to do. At this point, I think tech press has taken this noisy turn to only comment on the bad, focus on gossip, and create this skewed celebrity of what people are here working on. The reality is that jobs are more exciting than ever. Technology is moving in exciting directions.</span></p>\n<p><b>What has your experience been as a young lady in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve had life changing opportunities in tech. At the same time, I’ve faced outright sexism that has held me back in some ways. I went from growing up in poverty to a thriving career in fintech, and I am still pushing up against that glass ceiling. Tech has changed my worldview – I can do so much more now for the world in my career than other paths could have afforded. Building technology allows you to focus on what you value and create tools to amplify whatever that is. As a woman, sister, daughter, human, I have access to tools and intelligence that change the world—that is so powerful! </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We work with the world’s smartest people, which is why it is even more infuriating to see sexism and discrimination happen in the workplace. </span></p>\n<p><b>When did you want to start investing more time in women in Tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a woman invested in me! She was one of my first bosses at Square. She was someone who hired me knowing that I had no experience. There was an insane amount of work to do so she told me straight up, &#8220;You are smart, and you have a lot of potential, and if you work hard, you will succeed. But you have to work hard.&#8221; She totally took a risk on me. That was the turning point. After that, I felt that I had to pay it forward to other women with great potential. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In early 2012, we started the women’s group at Square. We hosted an event that celebrated women entrepreneurs inviting both colleagues and customers to join. We had women owned and operated businesses selling their goods, friends and family of Square shopping, champagne and cake. It was glorious! The event was particularly special because many of these women had never celebrated International Women’s day before and even fewer men had been invited to join the effort. It brought together our entire community to support and uplift women entrepreneurs. It was a small investment that would shape how collective Square celebrated diversity. </span></p>\n<p><b>What do you think it takes to survive in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It takes a sense of self. I acknowledge that the odds are stacked against me—and I use that disadvantage to fuel me and push me forward. </span></p>\n<p>Survival, particularly for women, requires a desire to work really hard with a thick skin. When something unfair happens, take any disadvantage to fuel your own progress. Double down and work harder. Prove that you’re indispensable. Don’t let bias paralyze you. Constant friction is certainly exhausting, but does have a profound ability to shape strong character.</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was Maggie Mason who put it all into perspective for me. She asked ‘How local is your feminism? Is it for you? Like, do you want a raise? Are you trying to set an example for your company? Are you trying to turn the world around and really be a bleeding heart martyr for women? I think yes to all. I definitely want fair pay. I want to see change for all women. I think you can invest your energy at different levels at the right time on the right cause.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? What really excites you and what frustrates you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Excites &#8211; I’m excited about totally new technologies. VR and AR, consumer biotech, democratization of tools. There are new canvases for us all to work on. New worlds to be invented. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frustrates &#8211; The noise and doubt in the media about technology companies. The comms industry pokes and prods at what the next ‘unicorn’ will be or who is failing or who is raking it in. None of that matters because the headlines do not push the work forward. It creates noise and distraction to those who are actually rolling their sleeves up. </span></p>\n<p><b>How do you think your background and life experiences shape the way you approach your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s no doubt that growing up poor gave me a real sense of hustle. I have always been totally obsessed with money because we didn’t have any. When I was in elementary school I would make my dad buy me a box of candy from Costco, and then I would sell it at market price to all the kids in the neighborhood so that I could finance my own interests. That same hustle drives me today. I can wear a lot of hats at Square, I can run Designers + Geeks, I can plan cool product conferences, I have my art studio and practice, I can focus on feminist initiatives, and still build a happy home and social life. Growing up with nothing makes you want to make the most of any opportunity that presents itself. </span></p>\n<p><b>Let&#8217;s see. How do you think women can be assets to each other in the industry?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women have the obvious opportunity to build each other up.</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Investing in women is probably the highest yielding effort any of us can make</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I fight twice as hard for women on my team because natural empathy doesn&#8217;t always exist amongst other leaders. I believe that men, women, grandmas, grandpas, people who are know, have ever met, or are related to women should fucking invest in women. </span></p>\n<p><b>What are your goals for 2016? What are you working on, either for work or for yourself?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am hoping to work on bigger problems, take bigger risks, fewer but more meaningful projects. I’ve just made the leap from leading creative strategy and operations at Square to work on poverty relief at IDEO.org. I’m moving from newly minted IPO to work with this amazing non-profit organization. I believe that we all have only so many working years, and when we can afford to, we should put those years towards the change we want to see in the world.</span></p>\n<p><b>What advice would you give to ladies hoping to get into tech or those who are just getting started? What you wish you had known in the beginning?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wish I had known that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">every skill within an organization can be learned</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In the beginning, I totally worshiped my engineer friends. I saw them as next-level smart and failed to acknowledge that they were just humans with different skills. Skills that I could learn too. I went from business operations to HR to product to marketing to design—all skills learned on the job! If you’re just starting out, when you meet someone who you perceive to be smarter than you, try learning what they do and see how far you get.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

No free or reduced lunch at schools and that type of thing. Some of those basic, everyday things people think of we couldn&#8217;t afford. At the same time, my mom worked for an airline, so we did grow up being able to travel a lot. It was interesting because, say my friends want me to go bowling, but I couldn’t pay the $5. But then they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Wait, how did you go to Switzerland?&#8221; [laughs]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peachtree City was—I didn&#8217;t know if upper-middle class is the right term—but it was a relatively wealthy town because a lot of people who worked at the airport lived there. So we weren&#8217;t in the best part of town, but it wasn&#8217;t a dangerous area—it was just a little bit lower income. We had good schools which was really important. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neither my mom&#8217;s family nor my dad&#8217;s family were from Georgia. It was just a place they picked on the map when we were moving there, but it was important to them that if we were going to stay there, that it be a good place like that to raise children. So most of my formative years &#8211; I think it was from fifth grade through high school &#8211; I was there. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was never the popular kid. I did band in middle school. I was kind of the the nerdy kid. I didn&#8217;t recognize that I had gender issues at the time, although in retrospect it&#8217;s like—oh, that makes sense why I didn&#8217;t care so much about my appearance because I didn&#8217;t want to look like that in the first place [laughs]. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was also raised in a conservative religion which I just thought was normal—I thought that this is how life works, these are the parameters of life, here&#8217;s how you live, here are your values. I just kind of went along with that until high school when my parents started having marital problems. My dad ended up moving out of the house my senior year of high school, and their divorce was finalized I think two or three weeks before my high school graduation. That was one of the first big awakening moments of my life because I was like—this marriage that I thought was going to be forever—some axiom of reality almost—fell apart. It made me wonder, &#8220;What else in life have I just been taking for granted like this? And what else do I need to question?&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><em>The answer in my head was, &#8220;Everything.&#8221; I needed to understand, &#8220;What do I actually believe?&#8221; Not just, &#8220;What was I told?&#8221;</em></p>\n<p><b>What was your path out of Peachtree City?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In parallel with that, </span><em>when there&#8217;s family issues going on, you don&#8217;t really think about things like hope &#8211; where do I want to go to college, what do I want to study &#8211; because you&#8217;re dealing with things at home.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And so I ended up going to the college that my family wanted me to go to, which was a religious school, and it was not where I should have gone [laughter]. I realized that very quickly once I got there. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a few years there, I realized I do have a choice about my life&#8211; maybe circumstances out of my control brought me here, but I can choose whether to stay here or not. I realized I had a choice and was like, &#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s go for it.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><b>Awesome.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. So, at that point I sent off a transfer application to University of Georgia without having ever visited there. Luckily I got in, and so while at the University of Georgia, my process of self-discovery continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But now, I was in an environment where I was like, &#8220;Okay, now I need to have this typical college experience.&#8221; By that, I don&#8217;t mean the partying. I never got into the partying scene, or anything like that, but just meet people, have new experiences, learn things, get different points of view. At that point I was done with church, but now was the process of figuring out, “What do I believe now?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, once that set of discovery was underway, then the gender issue was like, &#8220;MY TURN.&#8221; [chuckles] </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, before that, I didn&#8217;t really realize it was there, even though in retrospect it&#8217;s like—yeah, it was there. [chuckles] So, that&#8217;s when I first started really exploring like, &#8220;Okay, what are these feelings? What does this mean? What should I do about it?&#8221; </span></p>\n<p>I was very fearful, because even though I was in a college town, it was still the Deep South. I explored a little bit in my head, I tried a little bit out in public. I got involved at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT\" target=\"_blank\">LGBT</a> organization at the school. I made some mental progress and dabbled a little bit, and got a better understanding of the world. But before I knew it, two and a half years passed and I was graduating.</p>\n<p>Then reality is like, &#8220;Oh guess what? The professional world is not like school.&#8221;</p>\n<p><b>Were you into tech at all at this point?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I knew my parents couldn&#8217;t afford to help me pay for college, so in my first semester I immediately looked for jobs. I got involved with Unix Users Group, and ended up getting a job referral through them after that first semester. I was like, &#8220;Okay. Even if they don&#8217;t necessarily know that I want to work in computers, it pays a lot better than other student jobs.&#8221; I definitely had some skills from that, plus just playing with computers growing up. I wasn&#8217;t quite the younger end of the millennial generation, where they grew up with all that, but there was AOL, and those kinds of things. I definitely had some of those basic skills.</span></p>\n<p><b>So you graduated and started your move toward adult professional life. What happened next?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At that point I moved back in with my mom, because I didn&#8217;t know what exactly I wanted to do even then. I just needed to focus on finding a  job and it was really hard. I thought that because I had a degree then of course I&#8217;m going to be able to find a job. It won&#8217;t be perfect, but I&#8217;ll find something. That doesn&#8217;t work quite that easily, especially if you have a degree that was prepping you for grad school—not the job world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While still living with my mom, she decided that she wanted to move to Phoenix to be closer to family, because her sister lives out there. So, I was like &#8220;Okay, well, I still don&#8217;t have a job, so I guess I&#8217;m along for this ride too.&#8221; So, I move to Phoenix and am still looking for a job and ended up in a call center on the phones. Not the funnest job in the world, but it was like, okay, at least I got a start. I have my own income.</span></p>\n<p><b>So you got your start in a call center.</b></p>\n<p>Yep, and even though the job wasn&#8217;t what I enjoyed, it got me started on a clearer path. My job was being on the phone. That said, I still had some of these computer skills from college. While I was on the phones in the call center, I was like, &#8220;This process could work a little bit better. This report would be so much more useful, if it gave this extra information.&#8221;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would ask them, &#8220;How did you produce this? Could we make this better?&#8221; I would just do little things like that. Then after a while, they took notes of, &#8220;Hey, Michael (my former name) is doing these cool things, and we have this idea for a project we&#8217;d like to do,” so they pulled me off of the phones, and assigned me to a technical project.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the day, maybe two or three times a day, they would pass out little sheets that showed stats, because it was a very competitive, numbers-driven environment. They wanted a way to display those numbers much more frequently on the computer. And they knew I had some web development experience from college, and so they put me on the project and said, “Once this is done, you go back on the phones,” which wasn&#8217;t what I wanted to hear. Luckily, that project did not end up sending me back to the phones, because it worked out well enough.</span></p>\n<p><b>Awesome.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So then I ended up working on their operations team, which slowly morphed over time as the team grew, and I started doing some other application development for them. Eventually at a team’s request I was able to transfer up to the office in San Francisco to provide more technical support.</span></p>\n<p><b>So that’s how you ended up in Silicon Valley.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. And so that was great for a while. Then the manager who had brought me up here ended up leaving the company. It wasn&#8217;t bad. They just didn&#8217;t really know what to do with me at that point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of my teammates at the time ended up interviewing at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>. The position was a little too technical for him, so he gave them my name. They called me and I was like, &#8220;Well, I wasn&#8217;t even looking but Facebook&#8217;s calling me. I may as well at least talk to them.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><b>Yes [laughter]. Yes you should.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I talked to them and ended up interviewing with them. It was going great. At the interviews it was really smooth, and I was like, &#8220;Okay, these went great. When do I start [chuckles]?&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They told me no. I was like, &#8220;No!&#8221; But the &#8220;no&#8221; was delivered really well. At a lot of places you get told no and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Well, why? What was wrong with me?&#8221; But at Facebook they told me, &#8220;Okay, we thought you were a great cultural fit. You were a little bit weak on the coding interview. If our needs were different, then maybe that&#8217;s the kind of thing that we could bring you on and train you in, but we need more experienced people right now.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><b>So Facebook told you no and yet here I am talking to you from your office at Facebook?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They told me to keep in touch. I thought they were just saying that to be polite. Then, about a month after that, I got an E-mail from the recruiter just checking in to see how my job hunt was going. I was like, &#8220;Wait, are you serious about wanting to keep in touch?&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, a few months after that, I get another email saying, &#8220;Hey, can we set up a call?&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I get on the line with them, and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Well, remember how we said if our needs were different? Well, our needs are different now. Are you still interested?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yeah!&#8221; They said, &#8220;Okay, well we talked with the team that had interviewed you before to see if they were still interested in you, and they gave a resounding yes, so we would like to extend you an offer without even re-interviewing.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><b>Wow. That&#8217;s amazing.</b></p>\n<p>I was so glad I took that call in a private room, because I did a happy dance, and it would have been really embarrassing to be seen in public doing that. [laughter]</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s kind of what kind of got that ball in motion. When I gave my notice, and I told them where I was going and they didn&#8217;t even attempt to counter. They kind of knew, &#8220;Yeah, this is a lot better opportunity than anything we can provide.&#8221; So then I was like, &#8220;okay, it&#8217;s time to go to Facebook.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And at the time the gender stuff wasn&#8217;t even on my mind. The reason I thought when I moved from Phoenix to San Francisco, I was like, &#8220;Well, maybe it&#8217;ll be a better environment, it&#8217;s much more LGBT friendly there.&#8221; I was still terrified and even though the SF office was better than Phoenix culturally, it was still a big corporation and so I still didn’t feel like I could do anything about my gender issues. And so coming to Facebook, that wasn&#8217;t even an option on my mind. </span></p>\n<p><em>But then I started seeing the information they were sending out about orientation, and one of the things in there said the dress code was that we want you to be your authentic self, so wear whatever you want. It was like, &#8220;Okay, this sounds good, but do they really mean it?&#8221; And so I showed up to work on my first day with my nails painted. </em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I figured that&#8217;s transgressive enough that I could kind of test the waters, and see if they really meant it, but not so much that if it was a major problem I would get sent home, or fired or something like that. And nobody said anything for like, two weeks, and then somebody said something nice about it. So it&#8217;s like, okay, this is different. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then throughout orientation, and me even continuing throughout Facebook, you hear a lot about how we want people to be their authentic self and bring your full self to work because by doing that and not creating separate work and personal personas, you get to know your co-workers better. You have more relationships with them and get along with them and you understand and relate to them better. And so I was like, &#8220;Okay, cool.&#8221; </span><em>But having grown up and you know, mostly red states, I had a lot of like baggage about what&#8217;s acceptable in society and here&#8217;s what you can do, here&#8217;s what you can&#8217;t do.</em></p>\n<p><b>Yup. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s like out here I’m suddenly getting a different message—not only it&#8217;s okay to be yourself but we want you to be yourself. This one thing that we talk about here is that at Facebook </span><em>we don&#8217;t want to just serve a certain class of people. We want to serve the whole world. And to be able to serve everybody, we need to be able to represent everybody.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And that&#8217;s really why diversity is so important to Facebook because</span><em> if you don&#8217;t have representatives from all sorts of populations, then how do you really know what they need and how to serve them?</em></p>\n<p><b>Absolutely.</b></p>\n<p><em>And so even for the first couple of months, I didn’t know if I believed it. And it&#8217;s not because of how they were delivering the message. It was because these beliefs that I had about myself and what&#8217;s possible were so limited from the past.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And so the longer I was here, I was like, &#8220;You know, maybe this is possible. Maybe this is what they mean. They really seriously mean this.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I started here in July of 2014, and by September was the first time I ever talked to a gender therapist because I realize that it was important to me not to ever die with regrets or have something that&#8217;s just&#8230; you didn&#8217;t do that you wanted to do. Nobody wants that life. You want to have a fulfilled life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s not really now or never, but kind of like now is the best time to do it. So if I&#8217;m going to do it, I really should do it now. </span></p>\n<p><b>So you decided to start your transition while at Facebook.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yep. I talked to the gender therapist in September, and started on hormones in October. </span></p>\n<p>It sounds like a quick turn around, but it was a lot of time of letting go of those beliefs that were limiting me. Earlier in my life those limits were coming from outside environments, whether it was church, whether it was society, whether it was school. Once those external limits were gone, then the new question was whether I can get past my own self-imposed limits.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then it&#8217;s been really amazing to see how it&#8217;s gone. Because being here really is what finally put me in place where it felt like I could do this. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past there were worries, doubts. Will my family reject me? Will I get fired from my job? Even at my last job where I was in San Francisco where transformation would be easier, I still had that fear.  Being at Facebook is the very first place in my life, that I ever felt like, this is something safe to explore and to do. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was definitely not a punctuated process for me. It was something I started doing over time. Makeup over time, toward the end I sort of started dabbling with outfits a little bit. Throughout this whole time when I&#8217;m discovering who I am, and how I want to express myself, everybody was cool about it, because there&#8217;s so many different kinds of people both in San Francisco and at Facebook, that everybody understands and accepts this is who you are. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I just kept doing it because it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, people are being nice to me and it&#8217;s okay.&#8221; </span><em>Once, I came to work in a skirt and I still got invited to play ping pong. I was like, &#8220;Okay, cool!&#8221;</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> [chuckles]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I just kept slowly making progress and progress as I became more comfortable and overcame any fears through so many supportive people. </span><em>One of the biggest things I&#8217;ve learned through this journey is that it&#8217;s not something you can do on your own.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You really have to look to those who have gone ahead of you, rely on those who support you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here at Facebook we do have a very strong LGBT employee resource group. And so there&#8217;s a lot of support there and there were other trans employees who I could go to and get their personal stories. Before it&#8217;s like okay you read these things on the internet about these strangers or these medical references, but I can&#8217;t personalize that. But here I was able to meet other people who have gone through these things and I can say, &#8220;Okay, here&#8217;s the way my story is similar to yours, here&#8217;s how it&#8217;s different.&#8221; And being able to see that and see how it actually plays out in life, and just bounce my ideas and thoughts off of these people really helped me move forward because otherwise it was so theoretical to me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At some point in the process I went to a ladies wine night at a friend&#8217;s house and introduced myself to everybody as Addy. After that I was like, &#8220;I want to Facebook friend all of these people.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Oh, crap, but my name&#8217;s not Addy on Facebook.&#8221; So I was really torn because my Facebook account is kind of like my social hub &#8211; like all of my different social groups from my entire life are on Facebook. People from church. People from multiple colleges. People from various jobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I realized is that if it got to the point that not coming out was interfering with me being able to live the life that I wanted to live then that was the time to do something about it. So I was like, &#8220;Okay, well, here we go.&#8221; And I updated my name on Facebook.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I get in the next day and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay how&#8217;s everybody going to react, how&#8217;s this going to go?&#8221; The only question people had for me is, &#8220;okay what would you like us to call you now?&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My boss automatically switched pronouns, if he messed them up he corrected himself, so it was just super smooth. </span><em>That was what surprised me going through all these things—I was so afraid of how are people going to react.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Who&#8217;s going to reject me, who&#8217;s not, and the response was remarkably positive. Some people from past jobs were a little awkward about it and some members of my family, like my Mom, really struggled with it. But in my family&#8217;s case they realized that </span><em>even if they don&#8217;t understand it, or maybe don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s real so-to-speak, they did recognize that I was a lot happier.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, we&#8217;re going to ask some questions about these things but I was markedly happier.&#8221; So they&#8217;ve been supportive, so I just kind of going from there. I was like, &#8220;Okay, this is cool. Everybody&#8217;s supportive.&#8221; Since then it&#8217;s been great to see other people go through this process because one of the things that I mentioned that I learned was that you can&#8217;t do this alone. </span><em>I fully recognize that I got help from so many people. It was important for me to be able to pass that on to others because I couldn&#8217;t do it on my own.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I kind of owe that to other people to do it too. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m not politically active. Most of my help is kind of more personal. As new people join Facebook or realize that they&#8217;re struggling with gender issues, a lot of them get referred to me. Then I can kind of walk them through, &#8220;Okay, here are the great benefits we have. Here&#8217;s our local trans group at Facebook. Here&#8217;s what my experience has been so far.&#8221; So I think there are four people that I am mentoring right now.</span></p>\n<p><b>That’s so great.</b></p>\n<p>They identify at different parts of the spectrum, and they are at different points to the process. But look, this is important to me, so it&#8217;s really become a great little community. And it&#8217;s really fun to watch them as they go through some of the same steps that I did, because it gives them so much more perspective. Because when you&#8217;re the one going through it, like, &#8220;Oh my gosh, can I handle this?&#8221; And you see them going through and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh. Is that what it looks like from the outside?&#8221; [laughter] And so it helps me both help them through it as well as understand my own journey, and put into perspective what I&#8217;ve done, which helps as I consider the next steps, because I don&#8217;t know exactly where this is going to go from here.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m kind of taking it one step at a time. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m happy with what I&#8217;ve done so far. I don&#8217;t regret any of this.&#8221; I don&#8217;t necessarily know answers to questions like, “Do I want surgery?” I don&#8217;t know. And I realize it doesn&#8217;t matter. At this point, I can think, &#8220;What is the next step, and is that something I want?&#8221; And then it&#8217;s go, and then we&#8217;re moving forward. One day the answer to that question will be no, and then I&#8217;m done. [laughter]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is where I&#8217;m at just now—I started hormones in October of 2014 so it’s not been quite a year and a half. </span><em>And it really is kind of a second puberty. It will continue for a long time, both physically and mentally.</em></p>\n<p><b>Yeah.</b></p>\n<p><em>It really is a unique experience, because not very many people get to see from both sides of the gender equation.</em></p>\n<p><b>I would love to hear more about this.</b></p>\n<p><em>It definitely gives me a little bit more perspective on things. In some ways, it highlights for me the way the genders are treated differently.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And it kind of upsets the feminist piece of me. I understand I&#8217;ll lose male privilege, but it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m going to lose these rights. It&#8217;s like, well, everyone should have these rights. So, it makes it important for me to support those causes as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I’m also learning the way that the two genders are similar. Everybody&#8217;s human and psychologically men and women are more similar than different. </span><em>When you&#8217;re only on one side, you, to a certain extent, you romanticize or think of the other side as foreign, and it&#8217;s not. We&#8217;re all human.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So it&#8217;s been really interesting from both of those perspectives just to see how many interactions with others are different, how they&#8217;re not. And that&#8217;s kind of where I&#8217;m at. Today is just kind of continuing to learn and grow.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in five or ten years? Do you think you&#8217;ll still be in San Francisco in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t know. Throughout my life and all these different places I&#8217;ve lived, I&#8217;ve thought, &#8220;You know, this is a great place and I get to have these experiences, but not forever.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><b>Do you think you&#8217;d go back to the South?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh gosh no!</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, me neither. [laughter]</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not for the reasons you would think. Like if people ask me, &#8220;Oh, should I move to Atlanta?&#8221; then I wouldn&#8217;t have any problem recommending it to them. I feel like Georgia is the past, for me. </span></p>\n<p><em>It&#8217;s definitely important to me to keep moving forward in life. While I love my friends that I have there, it&#8217;s important to me that I keep moving forward and having new experiences and not just going back into the past. I want to keep moving forward and developing. </em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I don&#8217;t think that that&#8217;s the right place for me, even though for other people&#8211; I mean it is a great city. It&#8217;s the economic capital of the South. But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s my future. San Francisco&#8217;s been the first place I ever thought, &#8220;You know, maybe?&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><b>A long time ago I gave up trying to predict what the future will bring, because every year when I look back I could never have predicted where I am.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I do think that, for now, this is a great place for me to be. Facebook has so many opportunities both for personal growth and professional growth that I really have no reason I want to leave right now.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s actually kind of funny, the experience here almost feels like a time vortex. I&#8217;ve been here a little over a year and a half and I&#8217;ve done so much more here in that time than in multiple years at previous jobs. So I would like to keep that accelerated rate of growth and development as long as I could possibly manage it. And so I hope to be here for a long time.</span></p>\n<p><b>There&#8217;s been so much conversation lately about how diverse teams perform better—how different perspectives are being brought to the table to inform a better product, especially for a company as global as Facebook. How do you feel like your background and life experience impact the way that you approach your work? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think what I&#8217;d say to that one is that having grown up with scarce resources—when I was in the call center and we were building out that reporting and technical infrastructure, since it was all new to them, they weren&#8217;t necessarily committing funds to us, so there was this idea that resources are scarce, but you still want to keep doing more, growing more. It required me to develop creativity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was like, &#8220;Okay, well, how can I do this better? How can I make this faster? How can I make this handle more without being able to get additional resources?&#8221; That was my biggest thing that I got out of that last job—sometimes you just have to find creative solutions. You can&#8217;t always have tons of money or tons of resources to devote to a problem. And so you have to be like, okay, well, just because I don&#8217;t have the resources to do what you&#8217;re asking doesn&#8217;t mean we shouldn&#8217;t still try, doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t still what we need to do. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And in my personal life, I don&#8217;t want to be held back by, well, I only have this much experience, or I only have this car, or that asset, or whatever. It&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t want that. That&#8217;ll hold me back from continuing to learn and develop, and so </span><em>I have to be creative and find a way to do more with less. And then when I get more resources, then great, I can use these more efficiently, and do even more. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And so I think that&#8217;s really how my background has helped me here, is just that I can get pretty scrappy and figure some things out that other people wouldn&#8217;t have thought of because they didn&#8217;t have to struggle to be able to do that.</span></p>\n<p><b>I love that. My last question—What advice would you give, based on lessons that you&#8217;ve learned, to folks from similar backgrounds hoping to get into tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think the biggest one would be not to hold yourself back, because so many times we think that because of our circumstances that that&#8217;s all that we&#8217;ll ever have. It kind of sounds cliche to say “American dream,” but it kind of really is. That you believe in yourself, you know what is important to you what you’re passionate about, what you want out of life, not what you believe is possible based on past experiences. That&#8217;s what really helps me move forward because life&#8217;s been a surprise for me so many times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot more is possible than you believe if you take advantage of opportunities. Sometimes they come by, and if you don&#8217;t take them, then they&#8217;re gone. So just keep your eye out for those, and when they come along don&#8217;t wait and say, &#8216;Maybe one day.&#8217; Because there isn&#8217;t always a one day. Life is only so long, and everything in life changes. That is kind of what life is: it&#8217;s change. So take advantage of the opportunities when you have them. Learn all that you can. And just keep trying and learning.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><strong>So why don’t we start at the top—tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</strong></p>\n<p>I was born in San Bernardino, but I grew up in Colton, a train town right next to it.<br />\nMy grandfather was a farmer in Mexico. He came to the US to work for the Santa Fe Railroad Company, and that’s how we ended up where we did. The train yard was maybe four or five blocks from where we grew up. My father was also born in Mexico but grew up mostly in the US. My mother was born is San Diego. Her father was in the Navy, and he was stationed down in San Diego for a while. She moved back to San Bernardino at one point because of an illness with one of her siblings. So she grew up mainly in San Bernardino and my dad grew up mainly in Colton. They had four children. I’m the youngest. We’re all four years apart, so it’s pretty easy to tell our ages apart.</p>\n<p>At a very young age I experienced a pretty significant trauma. I have a burn on my arm.</p>\n<p><strong>Oh yeah. I didn’t notice until now.</strong></p>\n<p>Most people don’t notice it. The story of the burn on my arm from what I was told (because I don’t remember any of it) is they used to have bottle warmers with super long cords back in the 80s. I was wearing some pajamas crawling around, and I pulled the cord down and the scalding water landed on my arm and soaked into the pajamas. You have this super hot heated water—not boiling—but hot enough that when pressed against my skin for so long— it basically melted my skin. I think what they said was they ran cold water over it and then took me to hospital and when the doctors went to cut the pajamas off, my skin had stuck to the pajamas.</p>\n<p><strong>Oh my god.</strong></p>\n<p>They bandaged it, and they sent me back home and I was just crying constantly in pain for a couple of days. We had a family friend was a doctor and he said, “No, this is wrong. They totally messed this up.” And so he sent me to a burn center where they undressed the burn and then they put my arm in a bath – like some kind of medicinal bath – and they went and they scrubbed the dead skin off; this is something they had to do several times. Basically, every time the burn would scab over, I’d have to go back to the hospital, put it in the bath, and have it scrubbed off, have my skin scrubbed off. I mean, if this had been taken care of properly, I probably wouldn’t have any visible scarring at all. This is a symptom of not having the burn properly taken care of.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I got hurt a lot when I was little.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>I think that whole experience shaped me, shaped my personality. It’s something that I didn’t know until the last couple years. I knew about the burn experience, but I didn’t know a lot of the details. One of the things I talked with my therapist was about was the burn experience. She thinks it had a pretty significant effect on my personality. I tend to be a little more introverted, very protective, and defensive of myself. That plays into a part of my personality, and how it became a part of who I am. Maybe if that hadn’t of happened, I could have been a much more outgoing person. I don’t know.</p>\n<p>So that was like a very early trauma experience for me. There’s lots of other stuff that’s happened in my life. I don’t think we’ll have enough time to talk about all of it, but that was one of the significant things.</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah, totally. I’m all ears. I’ve actually been reading for myself a lot last year. I read a lot about things that were relevant to me and my growth, but I read a particular book that affected me in a lot of ways. About how childhood traumas—whether or not you remember them—you tend to cope, depending on when they happened, you tend to cope in one way or the opposite way. And, you may not even remember it, but it ends up just completely defining your personality profile, people you gravitate toward, etc. I have no idea what happened to me, because I don’t remember. I can make assumptions based on how I grew up. But it’s really fascinating, and horrible, and heartbreaking to hear so many stories of people having—based on very, very early things that they may not even remember—can completely shape them as a human being and how they cope.</strong></p>\n<p>I think it’s interesting. I don’t know why this happened, but it may have been one of those things where it’s like, “Oh, we don’t want you to feel different, so let’s not make a big deal about this. You’re no different. Nothing different has happened.” And, so I thought, “Well, this hasn’t had any effect on me. I am just the way I am, because, I’m no different than anyone else.” But, it took some additional processing as an adult to be like, “Yeah, I am different, and that’s not a bad thing.”</p>\n<p>When I was a child, I guess there was a common theme of being different is bad, so “let’s not imply that someone’s different.” Instead of an attitude of“being different is great.” You’re adding this different spice to the recipe, and that’s valuable. I think because of that, when I was growing up, I thought, “Well, this is not a factor.” As an adult and re-processing things, I’m like, “I think this is a pretty big factor.” And, there are other people who struggle with this kind of stuff, too, I know. My sister—her husband’s a firefighter—and she invited me this year to go to a burn survivors retreat in Southern California; she invited me to talk about my experience. I’m really looking forward to doing that.</p>\n<p>I’m in my 30s and I’m just barely starting to explore this part of my life. It’s like I don’t know what my story is because I haven’t really started to explore it until, like at this point. But yeah that was one experience.</p>\n<p>I got hurt a lot when I was little. My brothers and I always used to get into trouble. We had off-road vehicles—ATCs, three-wheelers—we used to ride all the time. We grew up in a part of Colton—the south of the freeway part—which is the not good part of the city. Partly because the Projects were across the street and it was mixed in with industrial. You had the train yards, you had factories, there is a cement manufacturing plant nearby. We lived in probably one of the worst places you could grow up as far as health, safety, things like that. We couldn’t play at the local park because my parents said, “It’s too dangerous.” I remember going there one time and finding hypodermic needles in the jungle gym thing and being like, “Oh yeah, this probably not a good.” As a kid I thought, “Oh, okay, that’s gross. But I’ll still keep playing,” But, yeah we didn’t get to really go to the park to play because my parents said it was too dangerous, instead we played on this train bridge that we used to call the Black Bridge. It was safer than the park, but it still wasn’t very safe because it was an active railroad bridge.</p>\n<p>The end of our street got this reputation as being an illegal dump. What that meant is you had large construction equipment—I remember an old school bus—just all this stuff would just get dumped at the end of our street. It was just a mass of stuff. As kids, we were like, “This is awesome! It’s like giant Tonka toys in our back yard.” They had like a crane—it was this old demolished crane, just falling apart decrepit thing—but, it still had the levers you could pull the switches, and we would jump in that thing, and we’d pretend that we were driving this truck. I remember the school bus had all the windows busted in. Glass all along the floor, and we were in there playing in it. Sit in the bus driver’s seat; pretend you’re driving the bus. Usually my oldest brother would be left in charge, and so, he would take us out there with his friends, and we’d all just mess around. That wasn’t very safe. My brother had to go to the hospital because he got glass in his eye from playing in the bus.</p>\n<p>One time, I had to go to the hospital because we were playing the good old game of “The Floor is Lava!” And we were jumping from one thing to the next. There was a toilet bowl &#8211; yes, someone just came and dumped a toilet bowl at the end of our street &#8211; and I jumped to the toilet bowl and suddenly, it shattered and slashed my leg. And so—I just think this is such a funny story because this is a toilet bowl in a dump that I’m getting cut with. [laughter] And as an adult I realize how unaware of the consequences I used to be.</p>\n<p><strong>Oh my God.</strong></p>\n<p>And I freaked out and I remember going, “Oh, I’m gonna to die, I’m gonna die, I gonna die!” because I’m bleeding out and I crawled my way home. I’m crying, and I’m freaking out, and finally I get to my front door and no one is answering! So I’m screaming and crying and eventually my brother came from around the house and he’s like, “What’s wrong?” and I guess they’d locked the front door cause I was crying and screaming. They didn’t want to deal with me. They didn’t realize I was injured. So, once they eventually saw what happened, they took me to the hospital where the wound got cleaned and stitched up.</p>\n<p>Nothing terrible ended up happening to me, but I just think it’s kind of like a funny story about how little I knew of how abnormal this stuff was. I think—I think that’s an element of growing up in poverty, like growing up in this environment of not having safety. It’s just something you accept. You kind of just think of it as the norm. You think everyone lives this way. I thought everyone lived this way. I thought everyone dealt with this kind of danger.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think that’s an element of growing up in poverty, like growing up in this environment of not having safety. It’s just something you accept. You kind of just think of it as the norm. You think everyone lives this way. I thought everyone lived this way. I thought everyone dealt with this kind of danger.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>This wasn’t something I typically share with co-workers when I was in San Diego. Instead we would talk about the newest tech gadget that’s coming out, what skills we should be training in, what cool projects we were working on. But people didn’t talk about the personal too often. But at the same time, I got a sense there have been people among us who have had rough lives.</p>\n<p>Then I moved up to the Bay Area, and I feel like it’s been really hard to find people who had that kind of life. I share with co-workers about my arm burn. I talk about the experience and about what happened to me as a way to introduce myself. It was actually in the context of in the beginning of our stand-ups.</p>\n<p>I started a tradition of beginning stand-up with a brief improv game, and one day the game was to say something about yourself that no one else knows. So I told this story of my arm. Then I also shared over lunch with one co-worker my story about the toilet bowl and the dump at the end of our street, and he just didn’t know what to say. Maybe he’d never really known anyone that had gone through that kind of experience or grew up in that kind of environment.</p>\n<p><strong>You mentioned in your pre-interview that as a kid, you got into tech and computers as a distraction from real life.</strong></p>\n<p>Computers made me really happy. I think it made me special. It enabled me to stand out from the rest of my family and get attention that I was desperately wanting. When I was born, my mom was a stay-at-home mom, but when I old enough for daycare, she returned to college to become a teacher. So by the time I started elementary school, I went to the school my mom taught at. Back then, every classroom had like an Apple II computer—my first ever exposure to a computer was an Apple II.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The computer wouldn’t yell at me. The computer wouldn’t put me down. The computer wouldn’t bully me. The computer wouldn’t make me feel bad about myself. The computer was safe, right? I think for me that was a big draw, that computers were safe. They were a safe space for me to spend time to express myself.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>My mom would stay after school, grading papers, and I had nothing else to do, so I started reading books about BASIC and I started programming little things in BASIC on the computer. Usually it was like, “What’s your name?” and you enter your name. Then it would say, “Hello ‘name’.” Because I had all this free time, I started creating these longer and longer scripts. I didn’t really make anything significant in the Apple II. I think it was because of lack of resources. All I had was this BASIC consumer retail book from Apple. I didn’t think, “Oh, I could go to a library and find a book and learn how to do this better.” And I didn’t have a mentor or someone who’d say, “You can do this, this, and this.” I was limited to what I could visually observe by putting stuff in the computer and seeing what comes out. That early exposure to computers made me feel special: something that I can input and get something out and get some creative expression too. I totally believe software engineering has an element of creativity in it.</p>\n<p>But yeah, the computer wouldn’t yell at me. The computer wouldn’t put me down. The computer wouldn’t bully me. The computer wouldn’t make me feel bad about myself. The computer was safe, right? I think for me that was a big draw, that computers were safe. They were a safe space for me to spend time to express myself. I think that was a big part of my draw to computers with those early experiences.</p>\n<p><strong>Walk me through early computer use to deciding to pursue it as a career and going to college for it. Did you have pressure from friends and family to go to college? What were their expectations?</strong></p>\n<p>I did, so, this is funny. So my mother was a teacher, and actually I didn’t want to go into computer science as my first job. I wanted to be a teacher. My mother at one point let me teach lessons in her second grade class while I was still in elementary school. The lesson I remember teaching was on how to do origami, and she gave me a bulletin board, and I thought that was the awesomest thing in the world. Again my own bulletin board space, I get to put the little wavy cardboard things around the edges, and then I’m gonna teach these kids how to create something, and then we’re gonna take all of their creations and we’re gonna put them on the bulletin board, and it’s gonna be awesome. I think this is a pivotal moment in my love of learning teaching. Kind of the concept of continuous learning.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We didn’t afford a home computer for a long time, but I had an uncle who put computers together. He put together a computer for my parents. Kind of a little Frankenstein computer. Nothing name brand at all, it was totally pieced together from a bunch of cheap parts. It ran Windows 3.11. First time seeing a GUI interface, first time seeing control panels and settings and software programs all this stuff. I spent a lot of time fiddling with it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>I remember another teacher, my math teacher in sixth grade let me teach a lesson on radius, diameter, circles, things like that. So I had several of these experiences where I was experimenting with leading as a teacher, leading students, helping people learn. At one point, I was talking to my parents about how I wanted to be a teacher, and I remember my mom saying, “You know, I don’t think you should be a teacher.” She said, “I think you should do something greater than that.” I’m not exactly sure why she said that to me. It may have been seeing how I interacted with the computer. That’s another thing, that throughout my life, my family regarded me as the computer whiz. To them, computers were like foreign entities. To me it was like something that naturally fit. Although my mom saw me having passion being a teacher, she also saw me having a passion for computers, and I think that’s why she told me, “Why don’t you try this other thing. Why don’t you focus on this other thing, because I think it’d be really great for you to get into something like that.”</p>\n<p>We didn’t afford a home computer for a long time, but I had an uncle who put computers together. He put together a computer for my parents. Kind of a little Frankenstein computer. Nothing name brand at all, it was totally pieced together from a bunch of cheap parts. It ran Windows 3.11. First time seeing a GUI interface, first time seeing control panels and settings and software programs all this stuff. I spent a lot of time fiddling with it.</p>\n<p>My brother used to work at Software, Etc. One year, he bought me this amazing Christmas gift. We didn’t always get along really well, so I was like, “This is really expensive, it’s huge.” It was a sound card. Back then, at least from my point of view, these things were like gold. Again, another piece to put into our Frankinstein computer. I remember putting the sound card in, and hooking up some speakers. I remember putting the sound card in and it didn’t work. This was before the days of plug and play. I had to go into the .ini file and look at the settings there. I had to call the tech support line at like six in the morning because the company was in Eastern Time Zone. My dad was like, “Long distance is too expensive during the day.” It wasn’t even an 800 number, so I had to wake up super early so I wouldn’t waste long distance minutes being on hold. Anyway, tech support walked me through putting things into the .ini file. It was like magic; suddenly I was getting sound out of my computer. It was amazing. All my games had sound. It took our computer to a whole other level. Taking just the visual and adding audio to it, that, I think, furthered this passion I had for fiddling with computers. To have a computer at home where I can take it apart and open it up and play SimCity with sound took it to a whole other level.</p>\n<p>Again, this is all me almost bonding with the computer, getting to know it better, realizing the tricks it can do. I didn’t do a lot of programming though, just configuring and stuff. We got dialup and AOL when I was in high school. I remember people running all of these software programs that would stream stuff into the chat window automatically, and I really wanted to learn how to do that. Back then, the Internet wasn’t full of tutorials, forums, and websites, as it is now. Every time I’ve ever gone into one of those bulletin boards I’ve found it to be a rats nest of people saying things and doing things. It was hard for me figure out how to take step one.</p>\n<p>They had this thing in AOL called the Community Leaders, and they let underage kids get free AOL in exchange for monitoring their bulletin boards, the junior bulletin boards. And so I did that for a while and was able to get the Internet access that way, and I thought that was really cool being connected with everyone. Eventually the Internet, AOL, chat rooms, and stuff like that became a huge part of my social life. To a point where my parents were worried about me spending too much time with computers. I think they were worried because I was in junior high, and I didn’t have a whole lot of local friends. I had a friend from Ohio. I had a friend from Los Angeles. I had a friend from Texas – all across the country. I would spend hours at a time on the internet chatting with these people, playing games, and stuff like that. My parents were worried to the point where my mom one time took the whole computer and put it in the trunk of her car and drove to work. Like pulling the needle out of a heroin addict, right?</p>\n<p>It was really painful for me, having that taken away. Especially because I was confused as to why it was a bad thing for me to have that kind of social life. Again, I think it really fit my introverted personality, to be able to socialize on the Internet. I was also learning lots of things. It’s when I started learning about how to make web pages. I had my own webpage as a freshman in high school, and I started making webpages for friends.</p>\n<p>I used to do online role-playing. So I would write out the roles or the characters or whatever, kind of D &amp; D style. That’s when I also started getting interested in how to make dynamic webpages, not just static ones. And I was trying to learn Perl. And I did some Perl programming back then which was really difficult. I asked my uncle, “I want to learn how to do this. Are there any resources? What should I do?” and he connected me a student who was a computer science major who would basically just say, “Go get this book,” or “Go look at this website.” And I would just have more questions and it was kind of like I could have used, I guess, a little bit more hand holding at that point.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;And so, ironically, recognizing it as something that’s not normal actually helps me. It puts my efforts into perspective. I shouldn’t feel bad because I wasn’t writing complete pieces of software at age 16. I had adversity I needed to overcome before I could get to the point of being able to learn how to write software. Acknowledging adversity, that what I went through is not something a lot of people in software probably went through, makes it easier for me. I put less pressure on myself. I feel more motivated. I feel more successful. I feel more accomplished. And, that enables me to continue to do the things that I love doing in my career.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>There was no computer science at Colton High, so I took a class on programming at the community college when I was still in high school. I learned Pascal. Later I went to UC Riverside and took some more classes on programming. And I loved doing it. I also wanted to go to computer camps and stuff we couldn’t afford, so we were really dependent on the public education system. I wish I had access to more resources, and especially a little more mentorship. My parents did their best to get me the resources that would help me learn how to do this stuff because they knew I was excited about it. I think I had a lot more potential that I wasn’t tapping into. And there were a lot of battles that were almost impossible for me to overcome. Again, I didn’t even understand that the environment I was growing up in wasn’t normal.</p>\n<p>And so, ironically, recognizing it as something that’s not normal actually helps me. It puts my efforts into perspective. I shouldn’t feel bad because I wasn’t writing complete pieces of software at age 16. I had adversity I needed to overcome before I could get to the point of being able to learn how to write software. Acknowledging adversity, that what I went through is not something a lot of people in software probably went through, makes it easier for me. I put less pressure on myself. I feel more motivated. I feel more successful. I feel more accomplished. And, that enables me to continue to do the things that I love doing in my career. Helping people learn, learning more myself, mastering the craft that is software engineering, and trying to make things better for people who came from backgrounds similar to mine. We haven’t even talked about what it’s like dealing with also being gay.</p>\n<p><strong>Let’s go into that. Did you want to come out prior to college?</strong></p>\n<p>I wasn’t even out to myself. I grew up in a Mexican-American household. Machismo’s a big thing. My family—nice things were not always said about gay people. And so, here I am hearing those things said, there’s no way that I am going to come out. There’s no way I’m even going to come out to myself. I told myself, “This is just a phase. You’ll get over it.”</p>\n<p>I’ve known people, also Latino, who came out to themselves but didn’t come out their families. But there was no way I could do that. I believed that it was just a phase. I thought that eventually I’d like girls; eventually I’d feel that same drive. Or I thought, this is what all guys feel—I’m just not as motivated as them.</p>\n<p>I remember I came out to my parents—I think it was my freshman year of college. Like, Christmas or spring break or something like that. I came back from school and I told them—initially I identified as bisexual, so I first accepted at least that I was attracted to men, but didn’t want to let go of that other part that I may be attracted to women. So I came out to them as bisexual initially, and they didn’t have a terrible reaction. I remember my mother saying something like, “We love you and we care about you, and we’ll always accept you. What we’re worried about is how other people are going to treat you. How hard your life’s going to be now given like the discrimination and the downright hatred some people have towards those kind of people.” I was expecting the worst when I came out to them, and I was relieved to have them accept me.</p>\n<p><strong>What was it like suddenly being out in your freshman year of college?</strong></p>\n<p>It was really exciting. I was like 1600 miles away in Iowa, three days drive from home. So I’m in a completely new environment; it was liberating. It was also the first time I had the opportunity to shape my identity without restrictions, and I discovered some of that social awkwardness that is still in me. Like even though I was outgoing, the introverted part of myself, at times, got the best of me. On one hand, I felt more extroverted because of that feeling of excitement, of feeling free, of feeling liberated, being able to shape my identity. But I also didn’t—still didn’t feel completely safe. Still worried about people judging me. There’s kind of this to-and-fro of getting excited about doing something new. And then, almost an emotional backlash later of, “Oh wow, did I fuck up? Did I make a mistake? Are these people not going to like me anymore because maybe I was being too gay?”Like maybe I was taking it over the top? I did stuff like dye my hair a different color. I tried wearing different clothes. I watched a lot of gay cinema. In the late 90s, early 2000s, I think there was almost a Renaissance of all these gay movies that came out. I was watching one and after another, especially since I think Netflix came out.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I wasn’t even out to myself. I grew up in a Mexican-American household. Machismo’s a big thing. My family—nice things were not always said about gay people. And so, here I am hearing those things said, there’s no way that I am going to come out. There’s no way I’m even going to come out to myself. I told myself, &#8216;This is just a phase. You’ll get over it.&#8217;”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The extroverted part of me kind of took it really far and then we’d dial it down a bit. I had friends who I thought we were really good friends, and we hung out a lot. And then the next year they wanted to room with different people. I think it was maybe a little too much. And so that maybe strained those friendships, being a little too different. I don’t know. I just noticed like a distance after freshman year. It’s Iowa, right? It’s a small college town in Iowa. I’m this kid from California. The roommate I had my freshman year, He said to me, “I was expecting this blond-haired, blue-eyed surfer dude.” And here he got this kind of chubby, gay Latino as his roommate. So maybe that’s an element of the culture shock I’m talking about, like I didn’t know what to expect with Iowa, and at the same time Iowa didn’t know what to expect from me. It took time.</p>\n<p>The period of first and second year socially was a little rough. It was more like my junior, senior year that I met people that I really meshed with and got along with. And also, I think I toned down the gay thing. I found a balance with my identity. I found the things that I really thought were me, and not just all this new stuff that I’m learning about and experiencing. And I still had the parts of me that loved to play video games, loved to watch movies. My sense of humor—that it’s a little obscene, a little twisted, but not just too gratuitously obscene. Things like that.</p>\n<p>I met people who I could make laugh. I met people with shared interests and people I could geek out with too. That’s the other thing. I think my freshman year—It was a large group of people who weren’t really nerds. They weren’t really geeks. It wasn’t computer/video gamey people. They were into sports. They were into athletics, and it’s hard to stay connected to those kinds of people unless you can find some kind of commonality. I was doing things that they weren’t necessarily interested in.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you feel like that culmination of those life experiences—like growing up in poverty, coming out as gay, tough family situation, childhood traumas, all of that—how do you feel like that affects you today in both a personal and professional way?</strong></p>\n<p>I think that it makes having a space very important. It’s one of the consequences of those traumatic experiences is there’s just too many things that can go wrong. There’s almost like this embedded belief of there’s too many things to go wrong.</p>\n<p>I think you mentioned before, risk aversion. Like, risk aversion was a huge thing for me. I did not like taking risks, and that’s been one of the pieces of the adversity I’ve had to deal with and I’ve had to try to overcome. If you’re risk averse, it holds back your potential. If you’re risk averse, it holds back the opportunities you can potentially take. Moving up here to the Bay Area from San Diego was a gigantic risk. A lot of this was attributed to the successes I had in therapy. That enabled me to take that risk. But here I am having to spend years in therapy working on lots of little things that have created this nest of triggers or behavior patterns that make it so hard for me to overcome or to take a risk. Had I not had to deal with any of that stuff, I probably would’ve moved up to the bay area as soon as I was out of college. I probably would have taken a risk.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It makes having a space very important. It’s one of the consequences of those traumatic experiences is there’s just too many things that can go wrong. There’s almost like this embedded belief of there’s too many things to go wrong.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Moving to the Bay Area wasn’t an option I considered after I graduated from college. I thought “There’s no way I could make it up there there’s no way I could be successful.”I remember looking for work in Southern California, and it took me like three months to find my first entry-level job as a software engineer. I was already giving up hope. I was already like, “Wow, I’m never going to be able to make this work. I have this degree and I’m never going to be able to find anyone that I can help, really.” And I think that’s something that was a consequence of all that adversity. And it’s something that I’ve been slowly getting over, being willing to take risks. When I do take risks, seeing the rewards that come of it, and that like, “If I take this risk, I’m not going to be abandoned by everyone. I’m not going to be physically hurt. I’m not going to get hit. I’m not going to be in a lot of pain, right?”</p>\n<p>Like kind of anticipating pain, and anticipating trauma is one of the big things that holds me back from taking risks. And every time I take a risk, and I see that it’s not resulting in pain, and it’s not resulting in trauma– and in fact, usually it results in very positive experiences. And it results in making really wonderful relationships that also add to that positivity. It just reinforces kind of—It’s like a changing of your reality of from the world is a dangerous place to the world is mostly safe. The world is mostly positive.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was nervous coming here for this interview. Those things are running through my mind simply because it’s part of my behavior patterns, my mental make-up. Kind of like someone who has a permanent injury where maybe they have a limp on their leg. You can’t really do anything about it, it’s there, but you learn to still walk, you can still do your job, you can still do all these other things. But you have to be aware of it. It’s also something that with work can get better.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>I have run into situations even since coming up here where I see everything is positive, everything is great, and then, something comes along that just is a huge unexpected threat. It’s funny because it’s from like the least likely of places like maybe other minorities, maybe people who you’d think would identify with you, maybe they share the same experience and yet like they’re not making safety a priority. And I’ve had to stand up for myself and set boundaries not just for myself but for all the other people who may not have the strength. Maybe they’re not far along enough in that process to stand up and say, “This is wrong.” And that’s something I’m still going through, too.</p>\n<p>Admittedly I was nervous coming here for this interview. Those things are running through my mind simply because it’s part of my behavior patterns, my mental make-up. Kind of like someone who has a permanent injury where maybe they have a limp on their leg. You can’t really do anything about it, it’s there, but you learn to still walk, you can still do your job, you can still do all these other things. But you have to be aware of it. It’s also something that with work can get better. Kind of like physical therapy. So yeah. It’s hard to talk about.</p>\n<p>I really focused on my career, and I think also the other part was my relationship with my husband in my 20s. It was my career and my relationship. Now I’m getting to this point after being in therapy so long I’m actually calling it my story, taking a magnifying glass to my history and talking to friends and family about my experiences and saying, “Hey, wow this did probably affect me. And this maybe explains some of the reasons why I’m this way and that way, and I also don’t think I’m the only person who’s had these types of experiences.” I’m willing to say things that aren’t popular, or may have consequences. That’s kind of a weird thing about me I guess. Even though I’m terrified of pain, I have experiences where the only solution I had was to invite it. The only solution was to stand up and get ready to face the consequences. But in cases where it doesn’t go so well, it is really hard for me. It is very painful. It just activates, it just runs through all of those old wounds that I’m still working on and still processing.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Even though I’m terrified of pain, I have experiences where the only solution I had was to invite it.

I have friends, and family, and my therapist, and other people that I’ve explicitly called and said, “Hey, if I need someone to talk to. Are you willing to listen to me? And can I trust your confidence, your confidentiality?”My husband, of course, a big part of my support network, a big core. And that’s how I’m rolling right now. It’s a long story, both exciting and scary to tell at the same time.</p>\n<p><strong>Well, I thank you for being so open. And if I’ve learned anything from just starting this project and being terrified to do it, it has been received so well, that I can only hope that it’s gonna be hugely positive for everyone involved.</strong></p>\n<p>I think this is a wonderful conversation to have. I think it’s a wonderful conversation to have about understanding where people start from. Because how can we measure someone’s accomplishments without recognizing that not everyone starts in the same place on the race track. Some people start a mile or two back, and then when they don’t finish in first place, we say, “Well, you didn’t do very good.” When the reality is they ran faster, and they ran longer than any of those other people. The person who ran first place, they just started at a different location. And I think that’s an important part of this conversation, about what is that mile or two back, what makes up that distance. It’s going to change people’s mind. It’s going to change people’s perspectives. And I really think it’s going to help us get better solutions, as far as diversity in tech. Some of the solutions don’t make any sense, and I think it’s just because we’re solving it without looking at what the actual problem is, or where the actual—I don’t want to call them shortfalls, it’s more like why there are differences, and how can we value those differences. I think that’s really about valuing differences.</p>\n<p><strong>What advice would you have for folks that come from a similar place, or have been through similar struggles to you, and are hoping to make it in this industry, or just make it work? What do you wish you could have told yourself in the beginning?</strong></p>\n<p>There’s a common thing about imposter syndrome, and having confidence in yourself and stuff like that. I think that’s all true. Working with a therapist really helped me, so I would say if you’re struggling, seriously consider meeting with a mental health professional. There’s nothing shameful or bad about it, in fact I think it’s a great way for people to take care of themselves. I think we should all get mental health check-ups regularly, totally embrace that. Therapists are helpful. You choose your therapist; you don’t just accept whichever one you get. Find a good fit and then you work with that person. You are building a support network. I think it’s very important in this industry especially for people who face the kind of adversity that I faced.</p>\n<p>I wish when I was younger I had met someone who was like me now. Someone who did struggle growing up, but eventually got to the point where I’m at. If they told me,“You know, it’s gonna be hard. It’s gonna be scary—you’re gonna feel scared, but you need to know your potential. You need to know that you have lots of potential and you can tap into it, and you are going to blow everyone else away. You are gonna do amazing things.” I wouldn’t tell myself that it’s an easy place to get to. I would say, “What do you want to learn? Let me hook you up. Let me connect you. Let me call people.” We really need more mentors like that. We need more people who are inviting others to the table who have similar backgrounds, saying, “Okay, what are you struggling with? Let’s help each other solve this problem. You’re having problems in interviews, doing white-boarding, or whatever. Let’s practice white-boarding together. Let’s get you up to that level. Let’s get you some additional help where you can get the jobs and get hired, and get into the industry. And then start doing the same thing where you start helping other people get up and reach the same bar, and help other people learn.”Not exclusively people who maybe didn’t have adversity or whose adversity is different. Invite everyone to the table, but don’t ignore the adversity.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I wish when I was younger I had met someone who was like me now.

Our first book was the Solar Energy Handbook. We’re now reading a book on Raspberry Pi, and we’re programming on Raspberry Pi as a group. I think there’s about 30 people right now in it. One of the first things I said when we started was, “I want everyone to know that this is a safe space, and that includes level of ability. Let’s not make fun of anyone if they don’t know about something. Let’s not laugh at anyone’s questions. There’s no such thing as a stupid question here. Every question is great because no matter what level it may be at, it gives not only the person asking it an opportunity to learn, it gives the person answering it opportunity to teach. This is a safe space for all levels. And this is also a safe space for all other groups that maybe face adversity in other places.” I wasn’t sure what kind of reaction I would get – but I had people thanking me in private messages and stuff, “Thank you for saying that.” And I was like, “Yeah, it’s kind of where we start, it’s where we begin.”</p>\n<p>One of the goals is not just to learn, but also to create a safe space. How do we do that? How do we start that? I wish that I could have found someone when I was starting out who was doing the same thing. It would have helped me in multiple ways, not just with technology. I probably would have told this person, “Hey, I’m gay. I trust you more because you’re establishing this as a safe space to work together, and to get to know each other.” Also at Solar City we just started an employee resource group for gender and sexual minorities. It’s another way hopefully, of making the people who want to help visible, and giving people the opportunity to help just by connecting.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think it’s a wonderful conversation to have about understanding where people start from.

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>So, let&#8217;s get started. Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My early years [laughter]. I was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia, into a whole family of engineers. Everybody is an engineer. My dad is an engineer, my mom is an engineer, my grandparents are engineers. But I am a designer. It&#8217;s really great that they allowed me to actually go to art school. When I was in preschool, we had a sculpting lesson. A whole bunch of kids were sculpting things, like a little ball, a little cube, little sausage, etc. I remember I sculpted the whole ship because my mom used to read me Greek mythology and I was so excited. I remember I was thinking, “Wow. You know I could make this whole ship with Jason and Medea and angels, and their supplies.” The ship was named Argo. It was supposed to take them from—I don&#8217;t know remember exactly the story, but that ship, I couldn&#8217;t get it out of my mind [laughter]. I remember I made this giant ship and I used all the play-doh that they had in this room [laughter]. Then, my parents came to pick me up. The teacher was kind of annoyed. She was like, &#8220;Look what your kid did [chuckles]. And they were like, “Oh my God. This is huge.” It was bigger than me. I thought it was completely normal to do that. My parents were shocked. They were like, &#8220;Art school. Mandatory.” [laughter] Since then, I was in the art school and that&#8217;s how my design career started.</span></p>\n<p><b>Awesome. I love that story. What was the impetus for leaving Russia and coming to the States? Did you always know that you were going to leave your home? What brought you over here?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, my parents—as I said before—they are engineers and this is Silicon Valley. They came here for better opportunities and for work and I came with them. I was 18 years old and still living with my parents [laughter].</span></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s nice.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They brought me here and they were like, “Figure things out.” I remember one of my very first moments—it was actually in the grocery store. When I was growing up in Russia in the late seventies, there were times with pretty much no food. We only had this one item available. Seaweed. I&#8217;m not sure why, it&#8217;s very random. You would go to the store, and the only thing on the shelves is canned seaweed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I remember going into a Safeway and I was stunned. To me, that was like a museum of food, to see all those different packaging and labels. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh my God, there are like five hundred types of sausages.&#8221; It&#8217;s not just one sausage like in Soviet Russia—it would be just one sausage. There were three types of bread. And there were no brands. The government produced everything, so there was no need for brands. You just go to a store and you get food, if you&#8217;re lucky. There were some times where food was available and some times it wasn&#8217;t available because of the economic problems. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But here in the US.., you could have bananas actually year round. I remember when I first got a banana in Russia, my parents—we were treasuring it. We got this green banana and we had it in the drawer for months, and then every day I would open the drawer and check if it was ready to eat yet. But </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">now, I could have a banana everyday. That was the biggest shock when I first got here.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> That, and also the fact I didn&#8217;t speak English. That was another part where you feel like you&#8217;re kind of just like an idiot—when everybody speaks English, except you.</span></p>\n<p><b>Wow. Oh man, I&#8217;m like, where do I want to dig in from here? Growing up like that, did you have any idea that that was abnormal in a global context until you left?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It felt totally normal. I would not question it, because if you are in this type of environment and everybody else is, then you think it&#8217;s normal. I remember during winter in Russia, there&#8217;s all that snow, so everything&#8217;s white. You&#8217;d take the Metro and you get out in your station and you look, and in the distance, you could see kind of black dots. That&#8217;s a whole bunch of people standing in line, and you could see it on the snow. The first thing you do, you have to run there and join that line, usually because they&#8217;re selling something. You don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re selling but you still have to get in this line [chuckle]. One day, I was coming home from art school. I saw this huge line, and I bought live catfish. And I brought this home in a bag. Another day, I bought some Polish deodorants. But again, you don&#8217;t know what you going to get [laughter].</span></p>\n<p><b>Wow</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you are there, it’s a reality of life. But there are also amazing things like theatre and museums, architecture, and literature. You have lots of really close friends, and people that you feel you could really connect with. That&#8217;s one thing about Russian culture that’s different from the U.S. People are more open and more genuine. If you actually ask somebody, “How are you doing?” You will hear the whole life story. It’s not just a polite question—whether you want to hear it or not. [chuckle]</span></p>\n<p><b>Wow. So, moving here, how long did it take you to not to feel like another?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I also don’t feel like the “other” because—it&#8217;s interesting, you have like all the different spectrums. People come here from all over the world, but you&#8217;re not really truly 100% American, but you’re not really no longer Russian, so you’re somewhere in between. It’s kind of like this time capsule where you’re somewhere on that spectrum and everybody else is somewhere else on the same spectrum, but they might be a little more Russian, or a little more American. I always have this different perspective, which I think is nice because you get to meet a lot of people here that also came from somewhere else, and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have another perspective, and together everybody has something interesting. A unique point of view. Something unexpected.</span></p>\n<p><b>Totally. Yeah. It&#8217;s different for me, but I was raised by a Norwegian, and mostly by a Norwegian. We almost grew up there, so my teenage years I was so conflicted about feeling not quite American and then wondering—is Norway where I&#8217;m supposed to be? Then finally when I can afford to go back, I went back a couple years ago and just concluded, “I&#8217;m somewhere right in the middle. I am not a normal American. I am not Norwegian. I am neither and it&#8217;s fine. I am a total mush of both.”</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are even people from different states. You see people from New York or California. They&#8217;re also very different. It&#8217;s even within the same country, you have all these different spectrums. It&#8217;s interesting you mentioned coming back, because I also did go back. When I worked at Google, I was helping to do some marketing at the Google office in Moscow. I noticed how everything changed. I felt completely foreign there, because that country that I remember, like 20 years ago, doesn&#8217;t exist. It&#8217;s like this moment of time, like it&#8217;s no longer there. All the businesses are different, people are different. I don&#8217;t feel at home there at all. I feel more at home here [chuckles].</span></p>\n<p><b>It&#8217;s crazy how that happens. Walk me through arriving as an 18 year old person who couldn&#8217;t speak English to getting a job in Silicon Valley.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My parents chose to go to San Jose because their friends were here. So, we kind of started out in Silicon Valley, so that was a plus. Then the closest school near my house was San Jose State. At the time I&#8217;m like, “Okay, I&#8217;m just going to go to the closest school I could get in,” so I had this experience where I really didn&#8217;t understand that you have to apply to school and go through this whole process that is a semester. There are certain times and deadlines. I had no idea. It was just me, and I had a whole bunch of drawings in a giant folder, and I was carrying these drawings on the bus. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got on some random bus with a giant pile of drawings—I remember it was hard to get them on the bus—and I said to the driver, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to university; I&#8217;m going to school.”</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And the whole bus was laughing, the driver was just cracking up. That was just really bizarre. And I also had these really weird clothes &#8211; kind of like a big skirt. I don&#8217;t know. Looking back at this now, I just can&#8217;t believe I actually did that. I mean, it was so bizarre. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then I actually got to San Jose State University—that was the closest school, wherever the bus driver took me. But the school was closed for the summer, or a break—there was some sort of break—because nobody was there. And I&#8217;m like, “Oh, this building. It says Art on it. So I&#8217;m going to knock on the door.” And I literally just knocked on those doors. There was this one guy, an architecture professor. He was there just cleaning up or just doing some paper work. And I&#8217;m like, “Hi. I’m this artist from Russia. I want to go to the school.” [chuckle] Surprisingly, he actually helped me. He helped me to go through the application process. I didn&#8217;t have their official transcripts. You have to do all this processes that I wasn&#8217;t familiar with. He helped me and I got into San Jose State. I eventually graduated from design program there. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was graduating, I was volunteering at the organization called The Art Director’s Club. It doesn&#8217;t exist anymore, but I think it was almost 15 years ago—they had these, kind of, portfolio reviews and my job was to take all the artwork out and lay it on the table so the judges could review it. There, I met an art rep, and he introduced me to people at <a href=\"http://landor.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Landor Associates</a>. That was my dream job. At the time, it was most famous branding design company in the world—they created the original FedEx brand, they created HP. Pretty much every big brand that you&#8217;ve heard of, they worked on it. It&#8217;s crazy. For me, that was like winning design lottery. I&#8217;m like, “Oh my God! I actually could work there.” He was able to get me an interview, which was another favor. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think at every point of my life, there were always people propelling me forward and helping me. Which I think is amazing. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s another difference between Russia and the United States. In Russia, it&#8217;s all about your connections and which family you come from. But, here in U.S is really largely based on your talent and, it&#8217;s really based on how hard you work, and how much effort you put into something. You could really achieve anything [chuckle], and people are helping. They&#8217;re not saying, “Oh, you&#8217;re a foreigner so you can&#8217;t really even apply there.” But, they&#8217;re actually helping you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was at Landor for about a year, and my school friend was at a company called E-Luxury.com. The idea was one of the very first start-ups. They were like, “Okay, we&#8217;re going to sell luxury goods online and maybe people will buy them.” But apparently people didn&#8217;t want to buy them, [chuckles] because they were incredibly expensive. There I got to design an online store for Alessi, or an online store for Bottega Veneta. We created this a big fashion mall online. That was also a very different type of work for me. It was web design. It wasn&#8217;t branding. From there, I got laid off. Everybody got laid off. I think it was 2000 or 2001 probably. I don&#8217;t know. It was so long ago, oh my God. Where did the time go?</span></p>\n<p><b>I know.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t know. My daughter just turned 11 today. It’s her birthday.</span></p>\n<p><b>Amazing.</b></p>\n<p>So I look back and I’m like, “Oh my God!” Biologically, I could be a grandma in maybe a year. [laughter]</p>\n<p><b>Oh my God.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s depressing [laughter]. So, so, yes. After that, I got laid off and everybody was unemployed. It was basically impossible to find a job at the time. Silicon Valley was in a huge recession. There was this website called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fucked_Company\" target=\"_blank\">fuckedcompany.com</a>, where everyone in tech would go. I don&#8217;t know if you remember but, it was really popular. They would leak internal company emails saying, “Sorry, you just all got laid off, and here&#8217;s what we going to do with you.” It was a collection of emails like that from all tech companies, and there would be multiple new emails every day [chuckle].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was a really bad time. I would open yellow pages, and start cold calling to all the companies. I would be like, “Hi. I’m a designer looking for work. Are you hiring?” Most companies were like, “Are you an agent? Are you representing somebody? Why are you calling me? And then, there’s some random luck. Yahoo was hiring. They had the group called Brand Creative Group, and they had an opening there. And they were like, “Yeah. Come on in. Come for the interview.” I came in, and they hired me. There was also kind of interesting because, coming from an agency—my first day at Yahoo, I was like, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Oh my God, everything’s purple and it looks like this crazy style from Austin Powers—like this furniture.”</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Everything was goofy and over the top. I&#8217;m like, “What did I get myself into? This is really different from my design aesthetics, and it completely would be horrible.” But it wasn&#8217;t the case. It actually turned out to be one of the coolest jobs I ever had. I was there for five years. I was there really early where there were only 500 people. I was part of the original team helping build what Yahoo brand was. And at the time, it was really one of the greatest companies in Silicon Valley. So I was really cool. It was a really fun ride to be there. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After that, my boss went to Google, and she said, “Well, you either go to Google now, or you’ll regret it for the rest of your life [chuckles].” Most people Google hired at the time were graduates of Ivy league schools, like Yale and MIT, but I was from San Jose State. </span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. Tell me more—or tell me everything—about the opportunity to design the Android logo. How did that opportunity arise? Where did the idea come from? How was it like designing that brand system—the biggest brand system ever, if you like?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crazy. It&#8217;s basically a combination of factors. It&#8217;s being there at the right time at the right place, being on the right team, and also being able to create something that resonated with people. As designers, we create a lot of stuff, every day. Most of the stuff never gets to see the light of day. We just create things that are disposable. Sometimes we create something that actually has life on its own, and it’s everywhere. It’s the same process. You could create something that nobody will see, or you create something that billions of people see every day, and it&#8217;s the same thing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Google, I was on the team called <a href=\"https://www.creativelab5.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Creative Lab</a>. Our job there was to use Google services to come up with new ways to market Google products. It was a launch of the open source Android system. The objective was “How do we get developers excited about developing on Android? How do we come up with some sort of identity that resonates with them?” Almost like the Linux Penguin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was originally a B2B identity, which not all people know. The platform was revolutionary and was open sourced for the first time—especially compared to Apple, I know with all the other systems everything was rigid and closed, really guarded and controlled. The Android logo was created as open source, because the operating system was open source, too. At the time, it was new. The logo also had to break some rules, and also become open source. Which, again, was completely against traditional brand guidelines. Now you see all these open source logos here and there. I think Android was one of the first open source identities out there. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think this open sourcing really opened up creativity. It became almost like a hackathon and talent show for logos, which used to be against the rules—especially at Landor where you have all these traditional brands like Visa and HP. I remember working on the guidelines. They have these giant, multi-page guidelines outlining clear space, correct colors, etc for logos. And a brand police team that would just watch how everybody is using it and approve when. It&#8217;s a totally different approach to identity as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The original name of the company acquired by Google was Android. Basically the brief was, “How do you make Android human? How do you take this software and technology and humanize it? How do you make this into this brand that is likeable and exciting?” Actually, that was my very first sketch. We were doing a lot of sketches. It was a team of people, and everybody was doing sketches. My very first sketch got picked. Because it was so simple. It was almost like an essence of an android. If you think of man, woman, and android, that was what the android was. It didn&#8217;t need any embellishments or details. It just needed to be simple, scalable, and recognizable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there, it just happened. We never even had a traditional design presentation like you have at the agency, or you have somewhere where you&#8217;re sitting at the table, and you have this fancy presentation with slides. The logo itself was kind of viral. So the source file got into some engineers hands. And a few weeks later, a whole bunch of engineers created multiple iterations of logo. They made a Hello Kitty Android. There was a Sarah Palin Android. There was Pokémon Android. There were just Android everywhere! And engineers had so much fun making it their own. After I left Google, the logo actually became also customer facing. It wasn&#8217;t designed to be customer facing, but because it had so much momentum and there were so many followers, it became kind of a movement—it almost became a viral movement on its own, which was amazing to see. Because everyone could customize it and it make it their own, it&#8217;s no longer about really pushing some marketing message, but it was something that people could have fun with and just be creative. It&#8217;s an interesting experience.</span></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s amazing. What is it like to let your design go in that way and know that it&#8217;s bigger than you and that people are going to take it and make derivatives of it? What are the emotions of that, of knowing that it will be bigger than you and having to let it go?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think it’s more like having a kid. It’s like with my daughter. I gave birth to her, but she’s a completely separate, independent human. She has her own opinions, and she has her own life. It’s kind of like you just send it out in the world, and you&#8217;re like a parent. You&#8217;ll be like, “Oh, that&#8217;s your baby. That’s kind of like a baby. That’s my baby, too.” I’m not as attached to it. In the beginning, I was always trying to change it. I would look at the logo and I&#8217;d be like, “Oh, this stroke is different. I don&#8217;t really like it, it’s looking too cartoony.” I would always try to finish it in my head, because I’m never satisfied. I’m trying to iterate on that. It’s never really fully finished. Then it’s just surprising. It’s like you have a kid, and the kid becomes famous, you’d be like, “Oh my god. I didn’t know that was just a little sketch on my computer. I didn’t know billions of people would see it every day.” It&#8217;s crazy. When I was working on that, it was such a small project. Android was not known, and it was just a tiny little thing compared to Apple. It was just like, “Let’s try this and let’s try that.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If I would have one cent for each logo appearance, I would be really rich person. But unfortunately, it’s not the case.</span></p>\n<p><b>Now you’ve moved on, and you&#8217;re at a great company. What do you look for in a job now compared to when you started? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think when you first start in your career, you look for learning opportunities and to grow as a designer, and to work with really experienced people, and you&#8217;re trying to change the world. A lot of young designers are very ambitious and the schools breed a very competitive environment where you want to be the best out of the best [chuckles]. When you graduate, you just can&#8217;t believe that the real world is almost pedestrian compared to what you thought it would be. You&#8217;re looking for greatness, and you find a lot of mediocrity. That&#8217;s very disappointing—we actually live in the real world, and you have to learn how things work. And the job is not really necessarily 100% about design. It&#8217;s about working with other people, understanding business, and all the things that you don&#8217;t really learn in school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then if you&#8217;re really experienced, you are really trying to think what&#8217;s next. You think two years ahead. You think three years ahead. Like, “What is the future of this business segment, and how can design drive business innovation? How can design help business?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that&#8217;s where the biggest growth is for any designer is—really understanding that design is not really about art or self-expression. It&#8217;s about business [chuckles]. It could sound really boring, but it&#8217;s really true. Especially today, where design has a seat at the table and designers are treated with the respect, especially if companies that are focused on design. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I just recently joined <a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Zendesk</a> design team. Zendesk is really focused on design, and design culture is at the core of the company. You didn&#8217;t have to campaign and actually educate people about how the design is important. At Zendesk, it&#8217;s already at the core and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so appealing, so inspiring for a designer to join Zendesk. The other thing is, it&#8217;s taking the most boring thing you could think of— it’s enterprise software—and making it sexy, making it beautiful. That juxtaposition and challenge is also really interesting.</span></p>\n<p><b>I love that—something about it ties back to just being so humble about Android and just knowing that it&#8217;s not about you, necessarily. It&#8217;s about affecting people with your work and solving problems.</b></p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s also very satisfying. It&#8217;s what can you do as a designer to help. That&#8217;s why the first thing I did when I joined Zendesk was become a support agent for a day. I wrote an article; it&#8217;s on the Zendesk blog. It was a really humbling experience. You just go in, and you start. You roll up your sleeves and do what you need to do to really, fully understand the space you are in, and do the best possible work.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s definitely—that’s the biggest difference between art and design. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Art is about self-expression, and it’s about talent, and it is about you. But design is about somebody else. It&#8217;s about business. It&#8217;s about appealing to the right customers. It&#8217;s about creating a product that is solving somebody&#8217;s pain point or problem.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>How do you think your background—coming from the other side of the world, how you first came here from Russia at 18, all of your life experiences—how do you feel that shaped the way that you put your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We live in a global world, especially now with the Internet. It gives you just a bigger, broader perspective on things, and also it gives you some sort of humility like, “I don&#8217;t know everything,” so I would be like, “It&#8217;s okay to not know everything.” I think it&#8217;s a good place to be. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another part of that is perseverance. I read somewhere that there are two things that separates successful people from unsuccessful people. Successful people actually don&#8217;t take “No,” for an answer, but they keep on trying. They persevere and they try.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s one thing that I think was very helpful for me—to come here as an immigrant, and to be able to hear “No,” and be like, “Okay, why am I rejected so many times?”. When I applied to San Jose State, I was rejected from the Design Program and I had to wait a year and apply again. I was rejected from every company when I was doing cold calls, except Yahoo, because they happen to have this opening. It teaches you to just not take “No” as an answer, and you just get things done. Just continue to persevere and shake the tree, and that something will fall off. That&#8217;s my approach in life [chuckles].</span></p>\n<p><b>Side note. I love that you could just call Yahoo and just call Yahoo&#8217;s phone, and talk to Yahoo. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They don&#8217;t even have phones anymore. None of the companies have desk phones now. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2001, you were able to—every person had a desk phone and there was a directory. The operator would connect you with the hiring manager, if you asked.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you feel about the current state of tech in 2016? You&#8217;re still really active. It&#8217;s mainstream entertainment now you&#8217;ve been on Shark Tank. It&#8217;s a funny, huge time for tech. I&#8217;m curious to know—what&#8217;s really exciting to you about it? What frustrates you about it?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back in the last few years, tech is just revolutionizing all the areas of life that used to be the most horribly neglected from design perspective—like education, medicine, or finance. There are companies that are popping up everywhere that are helping solve problems and pain points. I think that&#8217;s exciting, living in a time where you could innovate using technology. That&#8217;s exciting. Hopefully it will last for a while.</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m curious to see if there&#8217;s anything that you&#8217;d like to see change, even from a design standpoint, culturally? What would you like to see be different in design and tech in the future?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I see a lot of companies that are starting at the right place of the right mindset, but a lot of times they&#8217;re apps that nobody needs or nobody wants. There&#8217;s a lot of noise. I think it&#8217;s a side effect of there&#8217;s so many designers and engineers here, so there&#8217;s a lot of talent, but there&#8217;s a real shortage of really, truly good ideas. A lot of times you could start a company, get some funding, hire some staff, and the idea itself is not great. Then you run through their circle and just burn the money and create something that nobody really needs. That is what I see—there&#8217;s a lot of it—and that&#8217;s potentially the danger—why the bubble could burst again like it did in 2000. We might not reach that level of recession. But there&#8217;s a lot of bloat. There&#8217;s not a lot of depth. I feel like there is just a lot of people creating a lot of superficial ideas. They don&#8217;t do their market research. They don&#8217;t really truly understand the pain points of the customer. It&#8217;s a little immature [chuckle], and that&#8217;s okay, because it&#8217;s good to experiment and build things. But it&#8217;s not really “survival of the fittest.” It&#8217;s really more of “survival of who got the most VC money.” It&#8217;s not really the true test of the idea. There are companies that just live off selling stock, they don&#8217;t live off their product. That&#8217;s because the funds are readily available. I think that it will correct itself in about a year, probably. It will be a little more kind of manageable.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. I feel the same way. My last question for you would be, what kind of advice do you have for designers just starting out? Like what do you wish you had known in the beginning?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think the good advice would be, just don&#8217;t give up. It&#8217;s really hard when are starting out; there are so many disappointments. It&#8217;s kind of like being in an idealistic world—you just graduated and you think everybody is a genius and everything is wonderful. You can still get there, but it&#8217;s really going to be a long road of learning. When you just graduate your school, the actual real learning starts in the workplace: where you start to really kind of understand what companies are trying to do, and how you could help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Design is a superpower and a lot of people are underestimating it. It really is something that designers have where—if you have an idea, you can actually visualize it. And then people fall in love with it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another advice is don&#8217;t be afraid because a lot of times you are in the room with other people and they have really strong voices and your voice gets drowned, and your ideas get discarded. It&#8217;s hard to fight for your ideas, so instead of fighting just make them &#8211; make them on the side. Just go and create stuff on your own &#8211; work on your side projects and that&#8217;s a great way to just succeed as an artist. If you believe in it, just do it. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&#8217;t ask for permission, beg for forgiveness.</span></i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Tell me a bit about where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I moved to the Bay Area from New York City in January 2015. I grew up in Bethesda, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, DC. My parents moved to DC in the early 1970s for work. I don’t think they ever thought that they would stay there as long as they did but they both began their careers in DC. My dad’s originally from Brooklyn and my mother is from Germany. They now spend half their time in New York and half in DC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York is really home for me. That’s where most of my friends and family are. I moved there for college in 1997 and pretty much stayed through the end of 2014.</span></p>\n<p><b>Tell me a little bit about your legal background.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went to (City University of New York) CUNY School of Law, which is one of the rare, public interest law programs that exists in the country. The curriculum focuses on “client-centered lawyering,” and Queens, where the law school is located, is said to be the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. As a student I worked on public benefits, housing, immigration, and domestic violence related cases. It was a great place to work on cases because the clients were so diverse and they brought with them so many different ideas about how they wanted to resolve their issues.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My career after law school spanned legal and non-traditionally legal work but all in the social justice / nonprofit sector. In 2010, I began working with a criminal defense firm that handled mostly federal cases. I primarily worked on what are known as “CJA” or “Criminal Justice Act” cases, which are indigent defense cases assigned to private attorneys by the federal courts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s a lot of dysfunction in our criminal justice system and being surrounded by problems can be exciting. The difficult part though is that often your hands are tied, and that’s the real struggle. You see tragedy on a daily basis, and for most things, you can’t do much to make things better. For me, the victories were typically small ones—shaving off a few years of someone’s sentence, securing a decent plea agreement from an aggressive prosecutor, visiting a client in jail when the vending machine is actually working so that you can buy him some junk food. Small victories. I think this is particularly true for federal criminal defense work, which is mostly what I did.</span></p>\n<p><b>Walk me through your transition towards tech.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started with creative projects that presented experiences of criminal justice in the U.S., and I turned to digital technology as a tool. I launched my first project, a questions and answer project called Ask a Prisoner, at the New Museum’s Ideas City StreetFest in 2013. It was a collaborative effort with a friend, Sheila Rule, and the Civic Duty Initiative, which is a group of incarcerated men committed to giving back to the communities that they once harmed. The project lives on a Tumblr site. It was super simple.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few months later, I ran into an old friend, Luke DuBois, who had just recently been appointed the director of a digital media program housed within NYU Engineering School. We started talking about things, I told him a little bit about what I was working on and thinking about. He successfully sold me on enrolling in his program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going back to graduate school changed a lot for me. Initially, I wanted to make art and tell stories. But most of the courses I took were about digital product development and user experience design. And then, I naturally gravitated towards product development in the areas that I already thought a lot about—the law, the criminal justice system, government. A professor of mine, Beth Noveck, introduced me to the civic technology world—building digital tools to help government provide better services. For a course of hers that I took during my first semester, I developed a simple data project through which I transformed clunky data from the New York State Parole Board’s website into a more usable format for researchers. At the time, I was representing a man in front of the parole board so the course gave me an opportunity to think about my legal practice from a new angle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For 2015, I worked as a fellow with Code for America, which gave me an opportunity to build a digital civic engagement tool in collaboration with two other teammates. I recently accepted a position with 18F, a consultancy that helps federal agencies develop better ways of delivering digital services.</span></p>\n<p><b>What is it like working in Civic Tech and Silicon Valley?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The civic tech world is pretty wonderful, I find. I really feel like I stumbled into a community of smart, thoughtful, hard working, creative people with diverse talents. I&#8217;m working on similar issues to those that I handled as a lawyer, since usually my legal work involved managing interactions between individuals and government agencies (whether that individual was trying to secure public benefits or challenge a criminal charge). My work now focuses on systemic change rather than client advocacy, but the end goal is similar: to make government better serve the public interest. Right now is a particularly exciting time to work on digitizing government services because it’s relatively new. The agency that I’m working with, 18F, hasn’t even been around for 2 years. I feel like we’re all figuring out a new path together, which is exciting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As far as Silicon Valley, I don’t go there that often since I work mostly in San Francisco. Even the metaphorical Silicon Valley.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess I’ll mention the emphasis on change, impact, and scalability. Lots of people want to make things really big around here. But I&#8217;m used to representing individuals. So in the past, keeping a client from serving a prison sentence would be an example of success. And hearing updates from them over the years about how they’re doing alright would bring me happiness. In other words, the personal relationships were what made the work meaningful for me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hear more of this &#8216;big&#8217; talk when I&#8217;m  out and about, at conferences, or at social events. I hear public interest work talked about as “change making.”  I often hear people say things like, “I really want to make ‘impact’” even though they’ve likely never even volunteered an hour at a soup kitchen. I hear people talk about how big they want to make something before being clear about what the actually want to do, and why they want to do that thing. Scalability and impact make sense when you&#8217;re selling something, and I think this is one reason why people talk about this so much out here—most people in tech are in the business of creating products for market. But when you&#8217;re caring for people, these terms can come off as dehumanizing and impatient. For me, it kind of shoves the heart of public interest work out of the conversation.</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;d love to hear anymore differences that you&#8217;ve noticed switching industries, switching cultures. What else has been noticeably different for you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lawyer friend once said to me, “there’s no beta appellate brief.” I think that really sums working in law versus working in early stage product design. In law, you don&#8217;t really get to get feedback and do it over in the same way.  You polish up your work and you put it out there and that&#8217;s it. And there&#8217;s a lot at stake.  The law is iterative if you look at how our laws adjust over time, but practicing law isn&#8217;t that way.</span></p>\n<p><b>In your point of view, for the question of what struggles have you faced during your time in tech, you just put the two words “fitting in.” I&#8217;m curious to hear you elaborate.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, in ways, I feel like a bit of an oddball. I’m a lawyer by training though these days I work mostly with designers and developers. I often find myself thinking about risk mitigation when colleagues are thinking about creating cool, cutting-edge features. I think we learn a lot from each other, but I notice how much my background influences the way I think about my current work on product teams.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Something I am focused on is how one’s life experience perfectly informs us for the roles we play in this tech world. You could have spent 15 years doing something in tech, but that would not have equipped you mentally or emotionally for what you&#8217;re doing now. But it’s common for people to not value a breadth of experience versus laser-sharp specialization. It&#8217;s ironic.</strong></p>\n<p>True! Perhaps because it’s harder to measure and to understand? But I also feel like here there is a certain softness and acceptance towards people who&#8217;ve taken different paths and changed. I think in New York it&#8217;s it&#8217;s much more like, “how many years did you stay there? Where did you go to school? What is your linear trajectory?”  And here if you say, “I did this, and then it didn&#8217;t feel right, so then I did that.”  People are like, “Cool, tell me more about that.”</p>\n<p><strong>I think about the differences between New York and San Francisco. In New York, there are so many more equalizers. In food, there’s the dollar slice, the bagel, everybody eats those. Everybody engages in some of the same core things in that city, and it preserves culture in a way that it doesn&#8217;t, here. </strong></p>\n<p>The subway functions as an equalizer as well. It’s cheap, it runs all night, it goes almost everywhere, and most people use it—regardless of income, age, nationality, etc.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a lot more mixing in New York than there is in the Bay Area. It&#8217;s a much larger city than San Francisco so there&#8217;s more opportunity to have interaction with people who are different from you.  And living is rougher there so everyone is familiar with putting up with discomfort, having less space, less quiet, and making the best out of what there is in the moment. Exploration is a big part of enjoying New York—discovering something new or opening up to a new kind of conversation. So when tech companies offer in house food, in house health care, transportation—they’re consequently isolating their staff from these things. It&#8217;s good to have all of these perks but it&#8217;s also not good. </span></p>\n<p><b>What do you see yourself doing in the future?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I definitely feel like I’ve found a cohort in the civic tech community. Then, having practiced law, I care a lot about applying my new skills to help to under resourced advocates including legal aid attorneys. I also think about teaching and writing.</span></p>\n<p><b>What advice would you have for someone working in tech who wants to use their skills for the greater good?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many local nonprofits with thin resources that are doing really important work like protecting digital rights, increasing digital literacy, and just more generally using technology to serve the public interest rather than to create commercial products. And then there are many Bay Area organizations that are not tech-oriented but care for the many marginalized individuals throughout the Bay area. Idealist.org is a good place to look and see what interests you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give yourself space to try to learn about a new problem without feeling pressure to build anything. If the only thing you are able to accomplish is that you start to understand and relate to someone else’s struggle, you’ve done something hugely important. If you are up for talking about what you learned with others, maybe writing about it, that’s another helpful that you can do. Just because you’re an engineer or a designer or whatever you normally do, doesn’t mean that that’s all you have to offer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be ok with small victories. It takes time, resources, and support to build tools that will actually be useful. Social problems are typically complex and involve lots of stakeholders. It&#8217;s hard. I’m a big advocate of supporting existing projects rather than trying to start something of your own from the start.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Support efforts to make your workplaces more inclusive environments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are interested in helping improve government service delivery, check out 18F and USDS as they&#8217;re always looking to grow their teams. Code for America focuses on improving service delivery at the city and county levels and they have local volunteer groups called brigades that lead weekly hacknights.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If none of this stuff interests you, giving money to local community based organizations works too.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><strong>Tell me about your early years and where you come from.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I grew up in Minnesota. My dad is actually an IT security guy, so sometimes I joke that I never had a choice with my actual career path. It was pre-destined. I had to my peers, the most wonderful childhood. </span><em>My dad taught me how to build my first network because we wanted to play Quake against each other. Some kids would come home from school and do math exercises with their parents. He was like, let&#8217;s learn how to build your own website. I had the most awesome website that was devoted to Space Jam and had the Quad City DJ&#8217;s song actually playing on it I think it probably still exists somewhere, and I hope no one that I work with finds it.</em></p>\n<p><em>I actually learned about security from my dad through trying to thwart his efforts to keep me safe. I was really interested in Harry Potter and Harry Potter discussion boards. And he, being a concerned parent, was like, &#8220;You&#8217;re talking to strangers, I&#8217;m not so sure about this.&#8221; So I would actually go down to our basement at night and set up a computer on a segmented network so that he couldn&#8217;t find out about what I was doing and ride my bike up to the local library to use the computers there, because I understood how he was getting around all of my efforts. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So it was a really great exercise in learning about security which I think helps me in my job now, because I&#8217;m always trying to think about—from the user’s perspective and how they&#8217;ll intentionally or accidentally circumvent all the controls that we put in place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But at that time I didn&#8217;t really understand what I wanted to do in life and thought I wanted to be a lawyer. So I went to do my undergrad at Saint Olaf College, a small liberal arts school in Minnesota. I Majored in Sociology and Anthropology when I was at St. Olaf, because humans, and human behavior, and how we all fit together is really what interests me. I got to take fun classes from the anthropology of mood-altering substances, to learning about studies of crack-dealers in Harlem, and how they ended up in that slot in life, and how many of them had actually tried to have jobs in the city, but encountered racism and classism that eventually drove them back home, where they ended up taking on these jobs. Then, went on to law school, thinking that was still a good path for me at the time. Discovered very quickly that I hated it and </span><em>a wonderful professor told me that law school is like a pie eating contest where the winner wins more pie. So if you don&#8217;t enjoy the pie you&#8217;re eating, you should probably consider getting out now.</em></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s a good analogy.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve made friends there and they&#8217;ve all graduated and they&#8217;re like, that is exactly true. I decided at the end of the first half that I was going to leave and started looking at other programs to transfer to. Also fun fact about law school, if you quit at any point in the year, if you go back you have to start over at the beginning at that year. So you&#8217;re always better off finishing the entire year if you think there&#8217;s any small, tiny chance that you might ever want to go back. I started investigating other programs. There was cyber security programs that had popped up at the time in New York, but I was also engaged at the time and my significant other got into his PhD program in medieval history back in Minnesota. I checked out the University of Minnesota&#8217;s programs and they had a brand new program as cyber security. So applied to that one. We both got into Minnesota so we went back to Minnesota. Three months into my program at the University of Minnesota—and this was a really quick transition. I ended law school like third week of May, I started my master&#8217;s program the first week of June. Three months into the program, I started working at The Toro Company, the lawn mower people and irrigation systems, as part of a security team of three—Chris and Cary, both men and both still friends to this date. But it provided a really great experience for me to take everything that I was learning as I was going through school and applying at work, and then taking everything I was applying at work—or going on at work and applying it back to school. </span><em>School was an interesting experience in that I was younger than everyone by a good ten years, and there was only three women in the entire class.</em></p>\n<p><b>In school too? Wow.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It turned out to be really great for me. Everyone was so far ahead in their careers that I learned a lot of skills that are just becoming valuable for me now, even though I couldn&#8217;t really recognize it at the time. So school is going really well, got to work, was given several different projects. One was working on implementing single sign-on within our environment.  Another was a pen test for remediation, where I had to go to the different groups and get them to sign off on changing whatever had been found within the report, or accepting the risk. Then, I also had security awareness thrown into my plate. Security awareness, if you&#8217;re doing your job right, it means that all of the employees within an organization have a base set of knowledge on how to protect the company&#8217;s information and then also themselves, physically. Although, traditionally, it is more focused on the data and information protection side of the house. So, I had never done this before. I really loved it and I think the program, I guess it would be considered now, is really the perfect marriage between my behavioral science background and my security background, because you&#8217;re trying to change behavior about security. I took the project and really ran with it, and actually at school at the same time, I had to identify what I wanted to write my thesis on. I was like, &#8220;Well, I should probably write it on something that I really like.&#8221; So, I chose to go with security awareness. Connecticut has the largest cluster of Fortune 500 companies in the country. I&#8217;ve reached out to my fellow practitioners at the surrounding companies to see if I could come in and do one-on-one interviews with them to find out how they did their programs and how they judged their success, and what were the components. Then if they would allow me to administer two surveys—one to their security staff and a second one to their whole employee base—to ask them had they learned anything from the program? Did they like the program? What components of the program did they interact with?—to kind of form a best-in-practice report, which was the end result. Much to my surprise, a lot of people actually said yes, even though people are generally pretty secretive about their security programs. I took all the findings, wrote the report, graduated from school. At that time, I shifted over to the Target company running their security orange program. I made it there three months because it ended up not being a very good culture fit. </span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, wow. Dodged a bullet, huh.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. Absolutely. One of my professors in my graduate program set me up with someone who became my mentor at this time, and in working with him, he had contract work for me to do for some companies when the target time was coming to a close, and it became obvious that we had enough business to actually make it a full-fledged business. So we formed a company called Secure Mentem, where I got to build programs for companies big and small. Netflix was the first client that I signed, and had a lot of fun [chuckles].</span></p>\n<p><b>Just Netflix, no big deal.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their program, it&#8217;s a funny story. </span><em>I went to speak at a conference in LA and I was in line getting a salad. I&#8217;m super clumsy and spilled my salad all over—who turned out to be the CISO of Netflix—the chief information security officer. And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;m talking about security awareness tomorrow.&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;I&#8217;m real interested in that. I want to come to your talk.&#8221; </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then afterwards—well, he had actually been on his phone the whole time. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s not interested. He hated it.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Here&#8217;s my card. You should come out and we should talk about how you can help us.&#8221; So sometimes it&#8217;s just the small actions, spilling your—</span></p>\n<p><b>Spilling that salad [chuckles]. It&#8217;s the secret.</b></p>\n<p>Highly recommended tip if you want to meet someone. So he was my first client. We got really, really lucky. We got an introduction to our eventual investors a couple months into my tenure with the company, and they or had just been starting to invest cyber security companies. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;This is awesome. We love what you guys are doing. We could see this really working out well for our portfolio companies,&#8221; and it was super easy from there. And from everything I learned from other people, like trying to find money for their startups, we had it a little too easy. Ran with the company in continuing to get clients, and enroll in programs for the next two years.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I eventually ended up having a parting of ways with my business partner, and decided to move out to California, and got to work with a really cool startup called Apozy for nine months, building a gamified security platform, and helping them with sales, building out the modules, and helping them find their product-market fit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then the opportunity at Uber came up, and I couldn&#8217;t turn it down. It was a really exciting job opportunity over there. Now I build the security awareness and education programs for what would more traditionally be known as the information and security team, physical security, threat  operations, trust and safety, and privacy. And I take the BJ Fogg model of behavior change into account. </span><em>If you want people to change you need to give them actions that are small and easy to do, that they&#8217;re highly motivated to do. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So if we want to take a look at phishing; for example, the employee needs to know what it is. And you build info graphics. You build videos. You do a workshop having them come and teach them how I would structure sending out a phishing email to the company. Asking for volunteers from the group, looking at their public social media profile and telling them, &#8220;If I were a hacker looking to spearfish you, these are the elements that I would use to craft my email for you.&#8221; And then turning it around to the group, and having them partner up, and write phishing emails for their partner as just like a way of thinking about it from the adversarial perspective. For physical security, it&#8217;s building trainings on de-escalation training, what to do if you&#8217;re in a heated situation, if a fraudulent rider has been—or a driver has been taken off the account, and they come to our centers to complain. Like, how do you have a more meaningful, peaceful, conversation with that person? And then working with trust and safety on evangelizing the work that their team does to build safety features in the app, so that we know internally everything that we&#8217;re doing to protect our employees, our writers, and our drivers, and how we communicate that all publicly as well.</span></p>\n<p><b>What about internationalization? All of that to take into account—different cultures, everything?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. I&#8217;m super excited for all the internationalization I get to do this year. Aside from BP, Uber is now in more countries than any other company in the world. 67 countries and 360 plus cities.</span></p>\n<p><b>That is wild.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We&#8217;re opening an office in Pakistan. It&#8217;s crazy, but also exciting.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are the biggest motivators behind your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Protecting the trust in our company and protecting our people. If we have a breach—separate it into the different groups. If we have a data breach, our riders and our drivers aren&#8217;t going to want to use our platform anymore and the company as a whole could fold. Look at Ashley Madison. The nature of that company is very different than Ubers, but after their breach they pretty much don&#8217;t exist anymore. From a physical security perspective, I want all of our people around the world to know what to do if they&#8217;re in a situation where they could get hurt. Whether it be from a bad actor or a situation of a natural disaster. Everything that I&#8217;m doing is to protect the company and protect our people. Moving beyond that it&#8217;s to protect our riders and our driver partners.</span></p>\n<p><b>You&#8217;re in a subset of infosec where young females are very rare.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. Even more so than tech as a whole.</span></p>\n<p><b>How has the process been building your own name and your brand in the industry and how are conferences and speaking and events for you as a young woman who stands out?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s been mixed. I&#8217;ve been fortunate to have some really great mentors along the way who have kind of given me a road map for self-promotion—telling me right away, like write articles, get them printed, become a thought leader. Speak at conferences. These are the conferences to speak at first. If you get into these ones you will have no problems speaking at other ones going forward. And all of that has turned out to be true. Surprisingly, none of these mentors have been women.  </span><em>Speaking at conferences or just being at events, I&#8217;m often mistaken for being a marketer or someone&#8217;s daughter or their significant other, which is insulting in its own right. And then, oftentimes when they find out that I&#8217;m neither of these things, they take it as an opportunity to flirt with you or tell you about the time they got the best blow job, after they&#8217;ve compared you to their daughter or someone their daughter&#8217;s age.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I could probably spend all hour talking to you about those encounters, but that&#8217;s not why I&#8217;m here [chuckles].</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even being within my job when I&#8217;ve had issues, like trying to set up technical systems at work and I&#8217;ve been interfacing with our dedicated support person from Company X, I was asked at one point to speak to my male manager because “I clearly just wasn&#8217;t going to get it.” I went in and got my male manager and he was like, &#8220;The problem is not with Samantha. The problem was with your system. I told her to call you to fix it. You will find a way to work with her, and your manager will be hearing about this encounter.&#8221; So, I&#8217;ve been lucky in that regards to always have strong support. But </span><em>I often have to go to conferences or events with some sort of buddy designated that I can either like have some sort of signal for or text to come rescue me when I inevitably get cornered by some creeper.</em></p>\n<p><b>Is a lot of your work based on best practices that you have been fortunate enough to know early in your career? Or is a lot of it just total problem solving from scratch?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s kind of an amalgam. I&#8217;m able to draw on best practices from the learning field as a whole, but </span><em>the security awareness space is pretty new. There&#8217;s not a lot of people who do it. I would say less than 200 around the world.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So some of it I&#8217;m able to draw on learning models in different studies, and then applying it to security. I like to draw on the concept of making the familiar strange. Taking this concept that is familiar to you (security) and being able to see it from your employee’s perspective: this strange and new concept.</span></p>\n<p><b>Aside from working in your sub-set of tech, how has it been being in Silicon Valley for you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kind of&#8211; I don&#8217;t know. My answer would probably change depending on the day. </span><em>In some ways it&#8217;s a little refreshing. There are more women out here than women in tech in the midwest or women in tech out east. It feels like women are treated a little better and differently out here</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and then in other words that even if it’s always been challenging because I&#8217;m a Silicon Valley outsider coming in even working at Uber. A large portion of our people worked at another tech company before they came here. I was like </span><em>I&#8217;m the odd one out that came from this small startup that no one has heard of, so trying to impress upon people that I do have a legitimate background is sometimes a challenge.</em></p>\n<p><b>Interesting. That’s surprising to me for some reason maybe because you’re already speaking and you&#8217;re obviously doing the work and it’s interesting that you&#8217;re having to deal with that outsiderness even though you&#8217;re obviously deep in tech.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They don’t know that I—well that creates another interesting divide. </span><em>I don’t know how to go into a room and be like, “Hey I had my own company doing this for many years, and I was funded, and I speak.” I don’t know how to naturally bring that up in conversations so unless they go do research on me their own—l know I&#8217;m not alone, I think with us women in general that self-promotion piece is really challenging. </em></p>\n<p><b>Is it just assumed that you&#8217;re non-technical?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well that&#8217;s the other part of what I do. </span><em>Within the security community, security awareness is a hotly contested subject. Either people believe in it or people really don&#8217;t believe in it. The studies have shown 90% of all data breaches start with the human failing, usually in the form of a phishing attack. So you can put all this great technology in place, but if I as a hacker can send a phishing email or socially engineer your people, it doesn&#8217;t matter what you put on your computer. I win. Not everyone believes in that though. They want to believe that technology will be the answer, but throughout history that has shown to not be the case.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Look at the Trojan Horse and all these other historical examples where, if you&#8217;re able to bypass these controls, you win. So even within—my team at Uber is great—the industry as a whole, not everyone considers security awareness practitioners to be real security people.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you think your background and life experiences impact the way you approach your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think my anthropological and sociological background has really taught me to try to think about things from other people&#8217;s perspectives and practice more empathy, so I think it&#8217;s really easy in security and technology to assume that everyone thinks like you do and to put out materials that are in line with how you want to be taught or spoken to, not realizing that that way might not resonate with your audience or you&#8217;re using jargon that just goes over someone&#8217;s head. So I always try to take that 400 foot view and look outside of our narrow scope, not only in our communications but in the way we roll out technology, in the way we&#8217;re trying to train people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I&#8217;m now building a team, my experiences are definitely going to impact the way I try to mentor my people. And then, it impacts the work that I&#8217;m planning on doing as well. I think there are a lot of ways that the women in the security community could welcome new people, where right now, a lot of the most vocal women focus so much on the negativity that men bring, that they themselves make it seem like everything is just all bad in security for women, when that&#8217;s really not the case.</span><em> I think taking a more positive approach in talking about our experiences and our cause would probably incentivize more women to want to join.</em></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in five or ten years? Do you think you&#8217;ll still be here?</b></p>\n<p>I hope to still live in the Bay area. I have dreams of being a chief security officer or a chief information security officer. I think Uber is putting me in a really good place to learn and grow and find out if this is even what I really want to do, or it would definitely allow me to pivot to wherever seems to be the next role for me. I know I definitely want to stay in security.</p>\n<p><b>What advice would you give to folks from similar backgrounds to you or girls who are interested in infosec? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It depends on where they&#8217;re starting out from. Security people love to talk about what they do. Reach out and have lunch with someone pick their brain on the kinds of work they do, and like the vast amount of opportunities that there are within the security space. Even within my team we have data scientists who do security. We have people who do incident response. We have people who do security research. We have people who do security operations. We have people who go and hack our app. We have people who deal with setting up the basis for security, like on our networks. And then there&#8217;s people like me who do security behavior. There&#8217;s a ton of opportunities within this space and it&#8217;s constantly growing and changing. So, even challenge your assumptions off what the actual security space has to offer. And then find a person who has a role that sounds interesting to you, and ask to shadow them for a period of time. And then </span><em>don&#8217;t be afraid by the lack of women in the space. Like in every field, there&#8217;s some really quality people. There will always be detractors, but there are people who want to foster you and bring you into the community.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b></b><b>So why don&#8217;t we start from the beginning? Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I grew up in Southern California to an ordinary household: with an older brother, my mom and my dad. I am the first person in my family to be born in America; my parents grew up in South Vietnam and immigrated to the U.S. in 1990, a year before I was born. When they recall their youth in Vietnam, they talk about their farming, their lack of modern technology such as advanced plumbing, and also the violence and political unrest they witnessed and experienced firsthand because of the Vietnam War.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And so a large group of my family — my parents and my brother, my grandparents, and other relatives flew into SFO wearing business attire. Mind you, they were dressing to the nines when they landed on American soil! </span><em>They endured a 14+ flight wearing uncomfortable suits and dresses because they assumed that everybody in America wore business attire.</em></p>\n<p><em>My family came here without a lot, like $200, so growing up, we were on the poorer end of things.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> However, we were a big family that supported each other. While my parents worked at the garment factory, my grandparents, uncles, and aunties watched over me and my brother. </span></p>\n<p><b>When did you first become interested in design or creativity?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I entered grade school, I went to Chinese school in addition to my normal elementary school. My Chinese school was an after-school program after my normal school day that doubly served as daycare while my parents were working. </span><em>When I was there in the second grade, I met a teacher who was really adept at drawing Pokemons. During recess, crowds of kids would circle around him as he drew Charizards and Squirtles upon request. Watching him draw looked like magic to me. I decided that I wanted to be able to do that.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Afterwards, I got really interested in drawing Pokemons as well as other things throughout grade school, and drawing became something that I really loved. I continued my love of drawing into middle school and high school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In high school, I experienced the typical angst that all teenagers have with their parents during this age. What was really hard for me—and something I’m still figuring out today—is dealing with the language barrier between myself and my parents. Many first-generation kids grow up losing fluency of the mother tongue as they’re assimilating into American society, and I was no exception.</span></p>\n<p><b>As a first gen college graduate, what kind of pressure did they put on you to go to college or what other kind of expectations did they have of you as immigrant parents?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is an interesting question. I think because when I was growing up they were working so much, all they knew was that they wanted me to go to some abstracted reputable university and earn good grades, but they didn&#8217;t necessarily pressure me to go down a specific career path, like medicine, law, or business. Rather, I know now, looking back, that I had pressure myself to work hard so that they would be proud of me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I mentioned before, I had this really amazingly large family with a lot of support there. I had one auntie in particular who came to the U.S. when she was 16. Because she was a bit younger when she emigrated here, she got to attend an American high school, learn English, and expose herself to more opportunities for social mobility. Growing up, she would mentor me and make sure that I had the best access to the good education. </span><em>Between middle school and highschool I moved school districts. The first school district was poorer-performing, and there were many disciplinary problems in the classroom. Students would come in and throw spitballs everywhere, and people would plant stink bombs. Later, I transferred into a high-performing public high school in the city that my auntie lived in; I used her address to attend that high school. All of the students were obedient and cared about their study. More impactful though, was the amount of support they had from the family to push forward and “succeed.” My school transition helped me understand how important education and your community is in shaping the outcomes in your life.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> By virtue of having simply gone to a school where students were listened to teachers instead of aim spitballs at them, I felt like I was better set up for success. Not only that, but I had teachers who saw promise in me and ensured I got extra attention and help in areas I fell behind in. I&#8217;ll never forget that transition because it had been so formative in helping me understand the importance of EMPOWERING others so that they can be their best self. </span></p>\n<p><b>For college, you chose to study Race and Ethnic Studies. What prompted that?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. When I was entering to college, I was interested in Art given my past history and love of drawing. I was also interested in Sociology and understanding how people work and relate to one another. I considered double majoring in Art and Sociology, but decided to not pick art because I knew that it would be very expensive to be an Art major, what with having to purchase all of the materials. And instead of Sociology, I majored in American Studies with a concentration in Race and Ethnic Studies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many people, it took me awhile to adjust to college when I was there. </span><em>As a first-generation college student with little knowledge or guidance of how college works, period, I coasted in confusion in my first year. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was also weird to be at this elite liberal arts college on the East coast, far away from my family. I didn&#8217;t have any family on the East coast, so I was totally reliant on myself and my friends, but even with my friends sometimes, I felt guilt and shame over my background. </span><em>I was really close with my friends, and we talked in depth about the details of our lives and upbringings. And what made me realize that I felt different, was when we talked about family upbringings and traditions. For example, I didn’t grow up reading a lot of children’s literature because that wasn’t something my parents encouraged me to do. And I didn’t grow up celebrating Thanksgiving, Christmas, or Easter in the ways that my friends did either. These small conversations I’d have with friends made me feel really alien. </em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I struggled with my courses in the first year of college. Even then, I felt uncomfortable with asking for help from my professors and T.A.s, despite all of their attempts at making themselves available during office hours (which, as I look back, is a really wonderful thing about attending a small liberal arts school). </span><em>I was uncomfortable asking for help because it felt like a sign of weakness that I didn’t want to admit to. All my life, I was used to doing things on my own because I felt that that was a sign of my strength and independence. From getter my driver’s license, to leading the design of the literary arts magazine in high school, to studying for the SATs, to going through the entire process of applying for and getting into college — I felt like I had done all of those things pretty autonomously. Now, I understand the importance of asking for help and how it is not a sign of weakness, but rather, of humility and kindness to yourself.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout all this, I made friends with people who were really interested in social justice and social activism. Through them, I developed the vocabulary for thinking talking about my experiences and how it fits into the bigger picture of structural privilege. Throughout this time, I developed a more critical understanding of myself as an Asian-American, and this was also the time when I began to question my sexual orientation. I chose to major in American Studies because I was appealed to its interdisciplinary, intersectional understanding of how colonialism and white patriarchy undergirds many aspects of social, cultural, and political life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my sophomore year of college, </span><em>I recall having a hard time securing a paid summer internship with an American Studies degree. It’s hard to find a paid job with a social studies degree.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I couldn’t afford to take on unpaid summer internships, so I decided to try the whole business route because I knew that was safe bet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, I applied for an internship for minority students to enter the business field, specifically for human resources because that was the least technical thing available. Part of this process involved doing a mock interview with a representation from the organization. I did my mock interview with someone named Jennyfer, who changed the course of my life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the interview for a human resources internship, I answered each of her questions with some reference to my passion for the arts. Clearly, I was not a fit for a human resources internship, and I knew that already, but I felt like I had to try this out anyway. </span><em>Three minutes into the mock interview, and she stopped me and said, “I&#8217;m going to stop you right here because I can tell this is not a good fit. And I will tell you why.&#8221; She began to tell me what I knew in my heart already, and I cried.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She told me that, while there may be people in my life who pressure me to pursue something like business because it is a practical and safe choice, that I should follow my heart and do the thing I’m interested in. I bawled in front of a woman that I’d only known for no longer than ten minutes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After that, I returned to school and thought about how I could pursue my interest in the arts, while finding some job security with that, if that were even possible. Organically, I discovered and created opportunities for myself to demonstrate my value as an artist to my peers and other campus organizations. I started learning Photoshop so that I can try graphic design, and began making simple posters, flyers, and logos for my friends’ shows and other clubs on campus. In my various part time jobs, I volunteered to make posters for them as well when they needed it. With time, </span><em>I got better at graphic design, and even won a logo contest for the resident life organization and got a $100 gift card! </em></p>\n<p><em>When I was procrastinating on my school work and had free time over the weekend, I spent it learning more about graphic design through internship tutorials and books from the library.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I did a lot of this autonomously, and I reached a point where I wanted to find and establish a community of other peers who were interested in design as well. In my junior year, I created TypeClub with my friends, which was  a student-led design agency who worked with other classmates and campus organizations on their branding and publicity campaigns through the use of posters and logo identity design.</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was an empowering way for us to grow own design skills and develop our business senses in working with clients. I led our team for almost two years and developed a lot of leadership skills out of it. It was definitely a passion project of mine; rather than focus on writing a senior thesis, I managed TypeClub. We weren&#8217;t getting paid for all the work that we were doing. While doing this, I think I developed a reputation as someone on campus who did a lot of design work, and people knew to point to me when they need help in this general area. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my last semester of college, I worked remotely with this start-up called Texts.co, a textbook exchange company that was founded by a recent alum. The CEO found out about me through word-of-mouth as I was leading TypeClub, making websites for various other clubs, and developing a reputation all around that I could do design work. Working on Texts.com was my first experience doing actual product design.l I had no idea what I was doing and made so many mistakes now that I look back. But that opportunity led me to my first internship at a tech company in the Bay area. And that led me to my first full-time job. And that has led me to where I am right now, which is Facebook. So it was really a luck of the draw.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That woman Jennyfer changed everything for me. She was the turning point of my career.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do you feel like all of your background—your upbringing, your experiences in college, all of that—has affected how you approach your work and what&#8217;s important to you, and what your priorities are.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As someone striving to enter the technology industry, I had a lot of optimism for how tech can create this awesome change and impact society due to its far-reaching nature and scale. I was really excited to move to the Bay Area to start my career because that felt like the right place to be—</span><em>I loved San Francisco for so many different reasons when I first visited here—the turning point was walking down Market Street and seeing queer couples hold hands in public without getting stared at.</em></p>\n<p><em>After a few months of living here, and like many others I’ve talked to, I think that I became jaded about working in tech and living here. I had to negotiate feelings of guilt of my own privilege with working in tech. I thought critically about how my upward social mobility into a stable job also meant my complicity in a capitalistic system that disenfranchises the most vulnerable classes of society.</em></p>\n<p><em>This understanding shaped, and has continued to shape my viewpoints, and has made me extremely picky about the type of jobs that I would go for. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that&#8217;s why I really like working at Facebook, because even though it is this big technological company, it&#8217;s something that everybody uses and so I feel like in some ways I work for the public sector. It&#8217;s almost like this utility that so many people used for so many different reasons. </span><em>I think that my various perspectives and experiences also help my work because designing products for over a billion people requires looking at problems from many perspectives.</em></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m curious what it&#8217;s been like for you as someone who&#8217;s really active in the tech community but also presumably active in the art communities and queer communities in the bay.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s interesting because I feel that across those identities, you’d expect there to be some division. </span><em>I have struggled to understand how these these different parts of my identities can interplay with one another, because I’ve felt at times that they oppose each other. However, now I see how it can be possible to blend my interest in the arts, my queerness, and my work in tech into one whole thing! Look at me!</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think when I first moved out in San Francisco, I felt like I could do pursue only one thing. If I worked in tech, I couldn’t be an artist. If I were an artist, I couldn’t be in tech. I thought about my decisions and viewpoints in terms of binary, but as I’ve matured a little bit, I’m beginning to see things more as dualities—coexistences and blending of seeming conflicting points.</span></p>\n<p><em>Along the same journey in which I’ve developed a more expansive perspective on how to be a whole person, I’ve also gotten to be more comfortable with my queerness. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I first moved to San Francisco and started my first job, I was not out at all at my first workplace. I loved that job and everyone that I worked with, but I wasn’t my full self with them. I was single and personally not in a place to date, so I didn’t feel like there was any reason for me to talk about that aspect of my life. However, over the course of my time working there, there were small micro-aggressions here and there—automatic assumptions that I was straight, and that was what guided certain conversations—and I didn’t yet have the confidence to address them. It wasn’t that anyone demonstrated any homophobia or discomfort with queer people—there were other queer people at this company—and after a year and a half of working there, I felt like it was “too late” to start to come out, so I never did.</span></p>\n<p><em>That’s why when I started my job at Facebook, I decided that from the beginning, I would try to be as out as a possibly can. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Facebook, we have this saying where we want everyone to be their true, authentic selves—and I truly feel like they encourage this.</span><em> In the past year or so, I’ve learned how to better be my whole self—pursuing the arts, being out, working in tech, and also admitting to my privilege and channeling that guilt into productivity and healing, hopefully. </em></p>\n<p><b>How do you think tech can do a better job of building a diverse team?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that we have to think about our traditional means of going after people who come from different backgrounds than we do now, in order to make tech an environment that people can not only enter into, but stay in. </span><em>Earlier, we talked about the different distinctions we draw between tech, the arts, and queerness. The fact that we see these as divisions, instead of as simple differences, is one root of the problem and it&#8217;s one of perception.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For example, a commonality between tech, the arts and queerness is a defiance against some pre-defined norm. That’s one way you can look at this.</span></p>\n<p><em>This is why we have to think more broadly and inclusively about how we define our “diversity.” Yes, we definitely need to get more different types of people into this industry—and why? Because they have different perspectives that they can bring to the table.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m hopeful for how more industries will integrate the workflows and ethos that’s been well established in tech — I may be biased, but I think that the product design process is something that can be repeated with effectiveness in all sorts of teams and organizations.</span></p>\n<p><b>What advice will you give to folks from similar backgrounds to you, and who have gone through similar life experiences who are hoping that they get into tech, but may feel like it&#8217;s impossible?</b></p>\n<p><em>First of all, these people—I encourage them to understand that engineering is not the only route you have to take to get into technology—though it might be a the most well-defined path to take. There are a lot of different roles available—researchers, designers, writers, writers. If you are already following other paths, there could be opportunities for you to get into tech already, that might not be readily advertised to you. </em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s why I may encourage you to look at the job boards of companies you’re interested in, see what roles intrigue you, and see what other skills you need to develop to adapt to that particular role. For example, when I was a student, I was interested in graphic design and didn’t know what “UX design” was. But the more I scanned these job listings and gleaned the job responsibilities of a UX designer does, the better gauge I had on figuring out if I actually wanted to do it. Also, once I identified these job responsibilities, I worked backwards and developed those necessary skillsets (it was a lot of Googling things like “How to prototype in HTML?”).  </span></p>\n<p><em>All in all, this is not to say that engineering is bad, but I feel like right now, the conversation around “diversity in tech” is to teach minorities how to code. Rather, I’d urge a more expansive approach to these initiatives, perhaps one that really empowers people to identify and use their strengths.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So what I would say to these people is find ways to work with people who are interested in creating new projects or solving a problem and go through the design and development cycle that we go through in tech all the time—research, design, build, learn, and repeat. And it doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be a technological solution to a human problem. This is me speaking as a designer [chuckles]. Because I think that if you do that enough, you realize that </span><em>the problems we&#8217;re trying to solve aren&#8217;t always technological problems; they&#8217;re merely problems that can be solved using technology.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another thing I&#8217;d encourage these people to do is to use social media like Twitter and Facebook to find people whom you admire, follow them, and if you’re feeling a little bit bold (because why not), reach out and ask them what it took for them to get to where they are. When I was in college, I had a Twitter account that I used to follow a lot of designers who work in tech. Despite being in central Connecticut, I was able to tap into the bustling Bay Area tech scene from afar and stay up-to-date on trends. One day, I got a direct tweet from a designer from San Francisco that I was following. All it said was: &#8220;You’ve got more skills than a lot of professionally trained designers I run into. Keep it up!&#8221; A year later when I moved to San Francisco, I reached out to him to have coffee and learn about his career. By this time, he was working at Facebook. I wasn&#8217;t even trying to get a job; I wanted to meet him and thank him for that encouraging message… And then a year later, and somehow, we are now friends and colleagues working on the same team at Facebook. So it really goes to show that </span><em>being open minded to meeting new people and to hearing their stories can go a long way, and it’s important to not have some secret agenda because I think that people can see through that.</em></p>\n<p><em>I think that people who are not well represented in tech may also be the type of people who aren’t used to asking for help. Networking feels really intimidating. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, </span>I think it’s possible to approach networking less as a definitive, all-or-nothing opportunity to secure a job, and more an opportunity to develop true relationships and friendships with people who can help guide you. What’s key is approaching these relationships with curiosity and open-ness.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And I think that if you&#8217;re coming from a background where you may not know a lot of people who work in tech, you probably have a lot of curiosity and questions already!</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

I&#8217;m originally from Oakland, California. It&#8217;s going through an interesting renaissance and interesting change right now, which is quite interesting to witness. I should also say, I come from a pretty famous lineage in history. My great-grandmother is </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_McLeod_Bethune\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mary McLeod Bethune</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It&#8217;s something that means a lot to me. It means a lot to the legacy to live for. She did a lot for bringing opportunity for black people, at a really important time in history, to allow them to have access to education, to be a role model, to really push down doors. It&#8217;s inspiring. It&#8217;s inspiring every time I see her face, every time I hear someone say my name or recognize my name. It makes me want to strive for something more for myself, and try to fill the shoes as best as I can.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s something that my parents also always instilled in me, to believe in myself the value of education and value opportunity and try to also give back. It&#8217;s a running theme throughout my whole family to really lift others, and to also respect those that come before you, and to lead by example. And to have integrity for yourself. And to always know that your actions and the things that you do are being viewed. And that you need to represent yourself &#8211; have respect for yourself and have respect for your family in a way that other people can see that and respect that. So that&#8217;s really big. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As far as just growing up in Oakland &#8211; it&#8217;s been awesome. It&#8217;s interesting, I think&#8211; I have a lot of pride for my city and I&#8217;ve seen its pain. I might not totally understand everyone’s perspective or what they are going through in Oakland. I think there are struggles that I can never, ever understand. But the most that I can do is to respect them and not judge them for whatever someone&#8217;s experience is growing up in Oakland. Traditionally, there has been a lot of violence that has created a dark cloud over Oakland, and it&#8217;s always been in San Francisco&#8217;s shadow. And it&#8217;s interesting to see the change in people’s perspective of the city. Before people would say, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re from Oakland? What&#8217;s that like?” And now you hear people brag about the city and being excited about the opportunity to move there and what&#8217;s to come. I can walk around on the weekend and spot people who have just moved to Oakland because of that. It&#8217;s frustrating in talking about gentrification because some days I feel certain ways about it and some days I don&#8217;t know really how to feel about it. I think it&#8217;s good to see money flowing into the city and I think it&#8217;s good to see businesses booming and people out enjoying themselves. I do worry a little bit about how new businesses will shape communities and shape people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think big businesses that are looking to move their headquarters to Oakland have a responsibility to reignite the communities and really draw them in, inspire them and bring them up. At the same time, there are people who haven&#8217;t been through Oakland&#8217;s bad times to respect the good things that are happening, and I think that is what is frustrating at times for me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, they weren&#8217;t here when the murder rate was crazy. They weren&#8217;t here when we had the Festival at the Lake that got shut down due to violence. They weren&#8217;t here when Downtown Oakland was a barren wasteland and one of the only things we had for entertainment was the Jack London theatre. So it is frustrating for me when people are quick to toss around a lot of recommendations for Oakland, when they don&#8217;t have the full context. I feel like it&#8217;s my duty to stand up to make sure that people who&#8217;ve been here for a long time, give Oakland an authentic voice to what&#8217;s happening. That&#8217;s exciting to be a part of, and I know there are a lot of people in my community that are doing a really cool work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I didn&#8217;t even think that I would end up work in Silicon Valley, because when I was growing up it was always in the South Bay. It was close, but it was far in that, it wasn&#8217;t part of my community. Unlike today, there was no close connection that smartphone apps bring to one’s experience. I remember America Online, I remember dial-up, I remember chat rooms, and that was pretty much the extent of how internet controlled my life. I remember going to friend&#8217;s house and saying, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s get in chat rooms.&#8221; The internet was not an integral component in our daily interactions but rather was something you could use for fun at the end of the day, sort of like how video games are now. I never thought that I would work in it or be this invested in wanting to see things happen in tech now that I am older. </span></p>\n<p><b>Now that you&#8217;re in it. What are the most exciting things about it for you? What about your work really activates you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m really fortunate and blessed to be able to do the work that I do because it&#8217;s so impactful and on the cutting edge of changing the diversity narrative in the valley. I remember before I actually got into diversity work, I had a lot of apprehension about getting involved. Prior to my current role, I had been working in business development and sales roles. Diversity was something that I fell into. When I first got to Dropbox, I noticed a significant lack of diversity. I remember thinking &#8220;There aren’t that many faces that look like me. What can I do to just improve that?&#8221; Because working on diversity initiatives was not my full time job, it was not my main priority. I just thought, maybe I can do something on the side to contribute. I remember when I was considering working in Diversity I talked to a good friend of mine and she said, &#8220;Why would you do that?&#8221; Like, &#8220;Why would you go into diversity?&#8221; She was like, &#8220;There are already enough Black people working in diversity in Tech,&#8221; I thought about that, she further explained  &#8220;We need people like you inside the room, not outside the room.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This resonated with me because I knew what she meant. Currently, there are a lot of people talking about diversity and inclusion offering suggestions as to what needs to happen. I believe there are great organizations and programs that are pushing diversity conversations and igniting youth to see the importance of studying Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. For someone who works in Diversity on the company side, I face very different issues than those being talked about on the outside. I have very real conversations around changing the mindsets of my fellow employees. How do you help shape the minds of an engineering team that only has one woman on it? How do you get people to understand the importance of recruiting from different schools?  These conversations are more personal and intense. Personally, I was really apprehensive about switching roles and getting into diversity because it seemed like something many black people were already advocating for. I figured I should stay in a business role because many black people already hold diversity positions in tech companies. To me it seemed there were enough people talking about it and I needed to stay on the side where I can maybe have a narrative from inside the room as opposed to outside. </span></p>\n<p>In addition I was fearful that people would think that I&#8217;m not qualified as a business professional anymore. I feared people thinking that because I was in diversity I could no longer be a good salesperson or a good account manager. I ultimately came to the conclusion that since I started in those roles I would just bring that skill set toward influencing and changing people while pushing a diversity agenda inside my company. It was definitely something I wrestled with for awhile in deciding if I should do it.</p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s so interesting. You&#8217;re the first person to bring up the idea that there might be a stigma around diversity positions.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I want to make sure we are having healthy conversations and perspectives from inside of tech companies along with conversations outside. I think the diversity issues that people talk about who don’t work for tech companies is much different than an inside perspective. We need to make sure we see more press around the internal diversity work because it’s very, very difficult work, that a lot of people don&#8217;t get credit for pushing agenda for change. </span></p>\n<p><b>Have you learned things that were not even on your radar in terms of diversities since you started this position?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. I&#8217;ve learned about ways to suggest things, and how you need to approach certain problems with suggestions. When you want to recommend something, or you want to recommend a change, at most places there&#8217;s a system in place to do so. I have learned the importance of having internal allies. I have also learned the importance of making sure that you have clear objectives on what it is that you want to see change, and what it is you want to see impacted. It&#8217;s important to try to get people on your side before taking a strategic plan to a higher-level executive that has influence. Our head of Diversity, my boss, Judith Williams, has done a really good job of helping me to prioritize my thoughts and suggestions, and how I need to be strategic about recommending certain ideas. Most importantly there are ideas and suggestions that need to be introduced with strategic timing for optimal impact.</span></p>\n<p><b>It&#8217;s amazing how much it all boils on the politics and timing.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We don&#8217;t have a lot of politics at Dropbox. I believe there&#8217;s much more politics at larger tech companies as oppose to Dropbox, but it&#8217;s definitely everywhere. We&#8217;re a data focused company, so we like to see decisions made on data. Sometimes effective decisions can be made based on data. I would argue that there are some decisions that need to be made based on the foundation of being the “right thing” to do.  You cannot always see the moral “right thing to do” derived from data. It’s challenging when you&#8217;re working with people who might see data in a very black and white way, it’s important to help them see past the data and consider the bigger picture. </span></p>\n<p><b>What has it been like straddling the worlds of being a techie and being a local?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s a good question. Being a techie and being a local. I think a lot of times it&#8217;s when I introduce myself maybe out at a restaurant or at a bar somewhere, and someone asks, &#8220;hey, what do you do?&#8221; and I say, &#8220;I work for Dropbox&#8221;. Often the first response I hear people say is, &#8220;oh, so you&#8217;re the one driving up the rent price. Oh, you&#8217;re the ones that are gentrifying neighborhoods. Oh, you&#8217;re the one—is a very common response I hear from people.  &#8212; The blame is always put on people that work in tech companies and people are always pointing the finger like you&#8217;re the problem, you&#8217;re doing this. Luckily I am from Oakland. That&#8217;s when I really like to start talking about what things were like before all of this change. I definitely fight back with saying, &#8220;Hey, you know, tech companies do a lot of positive things as well, and they do have impact on people&#8217;s lives in a way that I think is positive. And they definitely have impacted the city positively in certain ways.&#8221; I remind people that all of this change comes with big responsibility that I think everyone needs to get better at. It is hard. It&#8217;s definitely hard to talk about it, but I&#8217;m pretty stern with how I feel about the area changing being a local and defending the responsibility of tech companies, but also defending how far the city has come. It’s important to make sure people understand&#8211;what Oakland was like in the past. Understand that there was not a lot thriving business like you see now.  Painting this picture of what Oakland was like in the past helps to give context for people who are new to the city.  Hopefully we can just work on bringing balance together so that people do feel empowered from all avenues. I can speak mostly about Oakland just because I&#8217;m always there and I speak to a lot of people who live there and I see a lot of the changes. I’m more concerned with figuring out how tech companies can help to empower the community. How can we bridge communities and tech companies?  What can tech companies do? How can we help out? I think there is a lot more communication that needs to happen.</span></p>\n<p><b>Totally. We&#8217;ve touched on this a bit but feel free to expand: what are the biggest motivators? What drives you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What drives me is one day to see a startup founder that is black that goes on to create a unicorn tech company that changes the world where everyone respects that person enough to have a voice of influence in the industry and the world. I believe that day is coming. Do I think that all the problems within diversity in technology will be solved when that happens? No. But I do think that&#8211; The moment this person can get the respect, and people sit back and say, &#8220;Wow, I can&#8217;t believe a black person started this tech company and has thousands of people working for them, with people rallied behind a culture.&#8221; I’ve seen what this looks like first hand. I&#8217;ve seen start up founders create a company like Dropbox, and this massive adoption and respect for a common vision. They have done such a good job of bringing in great people who help build their product up, and understand what it means to be a part of Dropbox and to live that culture. I would love to see the same thing replicated by someone who is ethnically diverse. </span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. For those who just may not know, tell me about how having diverse perspectives at your company are beneficial in building a global product.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s huge, right? It&#8217;s huge because so many people use Dropbox in so many different ways.  You could have the kid in the basement of their mom&#8217;s house producing music and saving their files in Dropbox. On the flip side you could have the design team for Vera Wang designing the next spring collection saving files to Dropbox. The parallels are crazy, diversity in a sense tells a story of the Dropbox product because so many different people who speak so many different languages in so many different parts of the world use it.  It almost goes without saying &#8211; the importance of having a diverse workforce to represent the diverse use is quite apparent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s really impactful and empowering to hear stories of people who use Dropbox in so many different ways.  If we&#8217;re going to do anything about making their lives better which is our main goal, then we have to have a diverse workforce to represent these different people and how they interact with technology</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m curious just how your experience has been personally as a black man in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Dropbox, we value intellect very much. And it&#8217;s a real core value of Dropbox. We seek out the best. I knew when I got hired at Dropbox that I belonged there because I knew they respected my intellect. I knew they respected my experience, and where I came from, and what I could bring to the table. I knew that&#8217;s how I was accurately judged and I never felt anything different than that. I&#8217;m passionate and I&#8217;m proud to say that because that&#8217;s just what makes our culture so unique.  I think every black person working still has certain stereotypes that they hold on to just based on how they were raised. For example, the perception someone might have about me coming in late to work.  Do they think I&#8217;m not working hard enough? If I take too long of a lunch break, do they think I&#8217;m not working hard enough? This is not about anything someone has done to me. These are subconscious feelings I have in myself and I’m sure other black people might have in a working environment. That general feeling &#8212; I don&#8217;t want them to think that I&#8217;m not working hard enough.   That&#8217;s pressure I&#8217;ve put on myself, but I try to combat that by being as transparent as possible all the time. And that just might be something that I feel I need to do in order to make myself feel comfortable, but I definitely don&#8217;t connect it to my company. It&#8217;s more of just the pressures of stereotypes you might have heard over the years.  These are jokes comedians make and things you see in the movies, off the cuff remarks. Years and years of these perceptions weigh on you. I just hope that nobody perceives me that way, so it&#8217;s always in the back of my mind, but it&#8217;s not ever really from somebody making me feel that way. It&#8217;s just more of perception of myself, but it&#8217;s something you have to live with, just understanding this is the world we live in. I&#8217;m fortunate to always have had great managers who have supported me, respected me, empower me, and made me feel good about myself.  That&#8217;s one thing that I&#8217;m fortunate and blessed to have had gained over the years. Quite frankly, to be able to do that I&#8217;m doing right now, is a proven testament to Dropbox wanting to empower me. I wanted to work full time in diversity and I was asked to be on this team. I was asked by our Head of HR Arden Hoffman, &#8220;Hey, you know Justin, you&#8217;ve done some amazing things here, and we love what you do, and we want you to work really closely with our new Head of Diversity, and want you to be on our team.&#8221; I couldn’t have asked for more support and opportunity then that.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. for sure. Where do you find your support networks?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I found my support networks in other people in tech. I think you have to go find them. I’m a serial networker and always make contacts outside of my company. I actually co-founded the Black Dropboxers Employee Resource Group at Dropbox. This helped with creating internal support networks for other black employees. On the outside, I try to go to as many events as I can, and participate whenever possible.  Any networking event, I try to go to. I think it&#8217;s pretty easy to connect that way with people that way.  </span></p>\n<p><b>How do your friends and family that you grew up with feel about the work that you&#8217;ve done?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think my parents are really proud of me. They&#8217;re happy to see me in a position where I can have influence within the industry. They have seen the development from when pressure started from Jesse Jackson and the Rainbow Coalition about tech companies disclosing diversity numbers.  They then started to have like I was saying earlier longer term story type connotation to it. In that, because tech is so influential and is such a dominant force in the way that people communicate this days. If I can have an impact on the youth, and I have an impact on people changing the way things can happen. My parents, my friends are super supportive and I always feel that they appreciate the work they&#8211; it&#8217;s always good because they want me to remind them to always keep it real. Also, sometimes have hard conversation with people when I need to have them with people about what I feel about certain things. Just in life generally whenever those teachable moments come around that you&#8217;re never to good to tell somebody that something might be offensive, or this hurt somebody&#8217;s feelings, or stand up for somebody.  I think that&#8217;s the biggest thing that I feel empowered to be able to know where I come from, and know what I represent in order to do that effectively when the time comes. My parents are super proud of me and the work. I&#8217;m fortunate enough to be a part of&#8211; at Dropbox I created something called the&#8211; so we have this hack week. So every year for a week you can work on anything you want. And I created this thing called the Dream Code Tour and I go and I speak to different students around the Bay Area about why they should even think about technology, the impact that technology has on their lives, some of the work that I do. And my company got behind me there and supported me. And so I&#8217;m just fortunate to be in a place where I can really impact and have a voice. And I know I try to give back to my community and the people around me all the time.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. We&#8217;ve touched on this a little bit, but how do you think your background and life experiences &#8211; like where you&#8217;re from, your family history, your previous work &#8211; how do you think all of that impacts the way that you work now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tremendously. In that I think growing up between Oakland and Berkeley I had a very very diverse group of friends growing up. I had black friends. I had white friends. I had Filipino friends. I had Mexican friends. I had Japanese friends. I&#8217;m just fortunate to be able to grow up in an area where my communities represent that. That means a lot because I think I was introduced to a lot of culture earlier in my life about the way people live, whether it be going over to my Korean friend house, and having dinner with his family in the 7th grade, or going over to my white friend&#8217;s family. I think it shaped a lot about understanding how to respect culture, how to respect where people come from, other values, and I&#8217;m blessed to be able to do that. I think the way that that&#8217;s impactful to my work, is because I feel like I can come from a pretty cultured background to be able to talk about why things are important and relate. Sometimes, I think in telling stories and getting people to understand how people are feeling, they need to have a relatable story in their own culture that they can relate to. Sometimes I try to bridge that gap and sometimes I try to share, hey, this is how their feeling, this is how you might be able to understand it, also. I think it&#8217;s tremendous in how it shaped me in being able to talk to people, to understand people, to relate to people. It&#8217;s just growing up in Oakland, growing up and going to diverse schools, and having diverse friends. It&#8217;s just tremendous because it has really shaped I think a lot about what I understand.</span></p>\n<p><b>Let&#8217;s go macro for a second. How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? What&#8217;s really exciting to you about it and what&#8217;s really frustrating to you about it? What would you like to see change?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh man! Jeez, what a question. What would I like to see change? Let me answer what I would like to see change first. I would like to see a lot more people of color in executive leadership roles in tech companies is what I would really like to see. This is a thing where there&#8217;s really kind of no excuse because you can look at a lot of &#8211; outside of tech &#8211; very successful black people who are doing a lot of successful things. Legitimately corporate America, whether that be in law and medicine and just business in general, there&#8217;s representation at the top. Not as great as I&#8217;d like to see, but there&#8217;s a lot more representation at the top outside of tech than there is inside of tech. I think when we&#8217;re talking about technology and you have the engineering side and you have the business side, I definitely think there needs to be a lot  more of an aggressive push to get those leaders on the business side into technology that come from the industry outside of it &#8211; to really influence that. Because I think when you&#8217;re talking about this diversity issue, everything really comes down from the top. As long as you have people who are planning in that seat and people who care at those levels, it will trickle down. That&#8217;s what I would really like to see happen a lot more, and I really don&#8217;t think that there&#8217;s much excuse for it just because&#8211; people poach talent and pull talent from all over the place, so every tech company should be really aggressive about getting that senior leadership on business sites and business roles for sure. I think it will be a little harder on the inside just because there&#8217;s not as many people of color that have been doing engineer for a long time, but for the first part, for sure on the business site. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also think what&#8217;s exciting is having people like you do this type of a project personally. I think there&#8217;s a lot of dialogue right now, and I think that&#8217;s great. I think the dialogue is really opening people&#8217;s eyes to what needs to happen, and it needs to continue and it needs to grow even more. I remember I was watching the Crunchies this year, and I saw what Slack did &#8211; when they were presented the &#8216;Startup of the Year&#8217; award &#8211; they had like three black woman engineers go up and accept the award. That&#8217;s big. They actually had the first diversity category this year in the award ceremony. That&#8217;s big too.  Slowly more and more, I feel like the message is getting out there. I&#8217;m good friends with Brandon Nicholson the Executive Director at the Hidden Genius Project.  For them to win the Google Foundation grant was very big for them. At Dropbox, we were also able to donate some money for their cause. Programs like that are starting to get recognition, which is also very important. I think we need stronger voices in the entertainment business.  That is a very strong platform for influential voices to discuss diversity.  I’m friends with Ryan Coogler, we went to high school together.  He is doing a phenomenal job using his platform to really promote amazing change and dialogue. I think the connection between entertainment and tech is very big, and it&#8217;s starting to fuse together which is great.  Also, being from Oakland and having a lot of civic pride, I&#8217;m very proud of Marshawn Lynch for giving back so much to his community and the overall community of Oakland.  I respect him for being true to what he believes in. I think he embodies what it means to be from Oakland, and he embodies what it means to give back. He cares so much about the community, and he cares so much about the youth.  We need people like him who have been successful. I think there are a lot of different messages that students and youth need to hear. Understanding the dedication that is required to play sports, to understand what it means to have different avenues in things you can do. How come you can&#8217;t be a football player and be a good coder? All of these things are great narratives for the conversation around the excitement of what&#8217;s happening. Art is another intersection with Tech where a lot of exciting things are happening and I&#8217;m happy to see that.  </span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in 5 or 10 years?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wow, it&#8217;s a good question [laughter] I’m also a pilot.  I started flying when I was about 17. Aviation is a big part of my life. [laughter] it&#8217;s funny when I have hard days I think to myself, maybe I should just go be a commercial pilot.  At the same time I really like learning and inspiring.  I&#8217;m learning a lot, and I have an opportunity that many people don’t have and I’m fortunate.  We&#8217;re doing some great work on my team at Dropbox. When it&#8217;s all said and done, I think I’m going to have a lot to share and a lot to give back and a lot to influence. I’d love to be in a position where I can consult people. I&#8217;ve been thinking of actually starting up a podcast around diversity. I have a lot of things to say. I would love to be recognized as someone who has a valuable perspective. I’d like to speak more openly about my perspective because I get frustrated with outside narratives at times. If it all goes south, I guess flying planes wouldn’t be the worse thing. I also want to teach young black kids how to fly.  </span></p>\n<p><b>My last question for you would be, what advice would you have people of color, who are really interested in tech and hoping they get into it, but don&#8217;t know what to do.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s a good question. There are some amazing programs that target students of color looking to get into tech.  Programs like: The Hidden Genius Project, Black Girls Code and Hack the Hood are great. I definitely think the support is there and it&#8217;s growing. There are a lot of online resources to learn more about programming, but at the same time if you don&#8217;t have resources it becomes hard. That&#8217;s the reason why it&#8217;s so important for me and others that work in tech to talk to students. Many students are not aware of what to do, and how to approach things. People need a network. They need a strong network of people that work in the industry. I’m working with a close friend in San Diego, and we are speaking to high school students about careers in general. He and I both agree that the best way that students can be prepared is to have a network of experienced mentors that they can rely on, and ask questions. If someone is interested in a profession where do they start?  If you are interested in architecture, or art, or want to be a pilot, or a nurse, or a doctor, how do you even map out what road to take? What should you study in school? What should you think about studying? How can the work you&#8217;re doing right now relate? There’s a need for a program to link this questions many young students have. It&#8217;s frustrating that &#8230; I wish I could tell a very, &#8220;This is what they could do.&#8221; I really don&#8217;t &#8230; It&#8217;s a much bigger issue than, &#8220;Okay, just do this.&#8221; Everyone comes from different backgrounds, too, so that might sound quite easy to one person, but another person might be like, &#8220;Hey, I don&#8217;t even have a computer, so how am I supposed to do that?&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I grew up in Haiti up until I was ten, and then moved to the States and attended school in South Florida. For the most part, growing up in Haiti was great—as a kid, you don&#8217;t know any different, right? It’s your reality.  Then I was sort of transported into a completely different culture, different lifestyle, with infrastructure that is vastly different than what I was used to. Some simple things required major adjustments, like taking a shower—we had a well that we&#8217;d pull water from it instead of just turning a knob. I also had a very active childhood – running around outside, playing soccer with my friends, unlike the States where video games and TV shows ruled the childhood experience. The shift was somewhat of a shock but I grew to appreciate both experiences. </span></p>\n<p><b>What was the impetus of coming to the states for you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So my father had been going back and forth between Haiti and the States for a number of years, he had been doing business here. He didn’t actually plan for me to make the transition until I was much older, he thought I was too young and impressionable and really wanted to protect me from what he considered to be an undesirable cultural shift. I didn’t understand that then but completely appreciate it now. Things were really expedited out of circumstances, back in &#8217;92, the President at the time, Aristide,  was overthrown. At that point Haiti was very chaotic and unsafe, schools were being shut down, and there was just so much uncertainty. It was the best option then.</span></p>\n<p><b>So at that point in your life, having internalized the culture of where you&#8217;re from, what other forms of culture shock did you experience other than video games and TV shows everywhere?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up in Haiti, —the issue of race isn&#8217;t such a big aspect of life. There&#8217;s classism for sure and it&#8217;s much more economic-based. Typically the elite and economically powerful class in Haiti were lighter skinned individuals, but it was never viewed as white versus black. I didn&#8217;t grow up with that lens, but coming to the U.S. and being told by my cousins and others that collectively, we were limited because there were things that the “white man” would never let us do. Which was just reflective of the environment in the U.S. ,  the concept of race and its institutional impact were indoctrinated into them at such a young age. For me, it was more like—if I&#8217;m the best at what I do, I should be able to achieve whatever it is that I want to achieve. That is what&#8217;s engrained in you in Haiti. It&#8217;s all about education and rising—using education to get to the next level. The vision of success to a Haitian family and probably to most immigrants, is that their kid becomes a doctor, a lawyer, engineer, or an architect. If you ask the question, &#8220;what do you want your kids to be?&#8221; That will likely be the answer. –Business, actually interestingly enough, in Haiti wasn&#8217;t viewed as the profession to get into. They are mostly mom and pop shops focused on selling goods that were imported from the U.S. Popular, big name, well established companies and corporations were not present in Haiti,  so running a business didn’t really come from a  point of pride as being a businessman. The people who were viewed as the elite were your doctors, engineers, architects, and your lawyers, so everyone wanted their kids to grow up to be those professionals, because that was a point of pride.</span></p>\n<p><b>Did you feel that pressure?</b></p>\n<p>Definitely, when I came to the U.S. I was set on being a doctor and did a magnet program back in Florida at a medical magnet high school. So yeah, I was on that path, and then I woke up and thought, &#8220;Man, this is crazy—eight years of school and then residency, etc. no way.&#8221; I had always been attracted to business. Even in Haiti, my parents owned a small store, what would be considered to be a bodega-type store here in the U.S. We lived out in the suburbs, so when I&#8217;d go into the city to school, on the way back home, I was probably seven or eight, but I would buy these local patties for, let&#8217;s say, 50 cents and then go back and sell each for a dollar in my parents&#8217; store. It was just like, that hustle—I always had it, I guess. I was always attracted to business, my mind naturally worked that way—looking for opportunities and figuring out ways to turn 50 cents into a dollar. When I came the U.S., the plan was to be a doctor. During that magnet program, I quickly realized that I really didn&#8217;t want to do that. I&#8217;d be sitting in class reading about the stock market, the companies being bought,  M&amp;As, and I had no clue what it was but I was always intrigued by it and would constantly be thinking about, &#8220;What is the strategy for this business? Buying this business, what&#8217;s going to happen here with—?&#8221; It was constantly on my mind. As well as sports, I was big into sports and still love sports. I&#8217;d be the kid in class reading the newspaper, and reading the sports and business sections cover to cover. Finally, when I got to college, I went in as a double major—I was convinced I was going to be the next Jerry Maguire. I figured, I love business, I love sports, so I&#8217;d match them together and be the next Jerry Maguire, but I knew that that industry was very hard to break into. My backup plan was a double major in finance and in engineering, because I liked math and knew landing a sports management job would be tough. Crazy, I know, but fortunately during the first week or two of school at University of Florida, I discovered that they had a sports management program. I thought, &#8220;perfect.&#8221; It was the ideal combination. I figured, I can use the sports management major to better understand the sports business and use the finance major to understand the financial aspects of things. Worst case scenario, I would simply work for a company in finance because I liked that anyway. I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to experience both sides. During my summers in undergrad, I interned with a manufacturing company, and I worked in transportation logistics one summer, treasury one summer and marketing one summer, so I was able to get access and exposure to different aspects of the business. Then during my last rotation with that company, I got introduced to a sports agent. The company occasionally collaborated with a former NFL player, I met the former player’s agent and was also offered an internship opportunity with him in LA for four months. This was the dream job, right? I wanted to be a sports agent and I finally got to work with a sports agency, but I quickly realized then too, that it wasn&#8217;t what I really wanted to do. Part of that was as much as I enjoyed it, I always had this tug within me to go back to Haiti and do economic development and I thought about what it would take to do that. I knew I also needed a broad set of business and management skills. So I decided to revert to my finance background and went back to work for the same company that I&#8217;d interned with for three summers. I joined their treasury group, and long story short, after two years there, I went to business school, then went to Wall Street and now Lend Street.</p>\n<p><b>Give me a little rundown of LendStreet. </b></p>\n<p>Sure. AtLendStreet, we are a socially conscious lending company with a mission to deliver financial health to the more than 75 million Americans struggling with debt. We offer loans specifically designed to help our clients modify, refinance and reduce their existing debt, and lower their payments. Our clients are people who have so much debt that every month, the minimum payments required on those debt eat up most of their income. We provide solutions to help those people get out of debt, reduce their monthly payments and also be able to rebuild their credit and get back in the system quicker. Our thesis is that many of these individuals are obviously good people and people who historically had good credit because they&#8217;ve been able to access 30, 40, 50 thousand dollars of credit card debt, but something happened. A lot of times, they built up those sort of balance because they experienced a financial shock.  Now, they are looking for a solution for debt relief. Typically, creditors are willing to provide relief when someone is in distress, but they usually require a short-term payment plan or a lump sum and the consumermay not have the ability to come up with either, therefore he/she can&#8217;t even take advantage of the relief. We have trusted companies that negotiate on behalf of our clients and we put up the money so they can take advantage of the discount that the banks are willing to give. We give them a lower interest rate, lower payment, and a longer time to pay.  Today, the options available to them are credit counseling, debt settlement and bankruptcy. Credit counseling provide some interest and payment relief but doesn&#8217;t provide principal relief.  Debt settlement requires consumers to be delinquent on their debt for a long period of time while they save up enough money to negotiate with the bank. There&#8217;s some value to that but the main problem with that model is that the consumers ruins their credit scores and there&#8217;s no mechanism to rebuild it. The other option which is the most common solution people think of when they&#8217;re in financial distress – bankruptcy, is definitely not the optimal solution and can end up resulting in an even bigger trap. Every time you complete an application, whether it&#8217;s for a job or renting a home—there&#8217;s one question consistently asked on all of those applications, and it&#8217;s, &#8220;have you ever filed for bankruptcy?&#8221; So, there&#8217;s a permanent scarlet letter that can keep families from living in the neighborhood that provides better education opportunities for their kids simply because they were looking for a solution to get out of debt; there’s a real ripple effect to bankruptcy. The LendStreet model leverages the best of the credit counseling, debt settlement and bankruptcy models, without all of the adverse impacts, and make up for all of their limitations.</p>\n<p><b>What was it like going from Wall Street to Silicon Valley? What is similar? What&#8217;s different? What surprised you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are vast differences between Wall Street and Silicon Valley but also many similarities. Wall Street, like Silicon Valley, attracts some of the brightest minds the country has to offer.  They both pride themselves on problem solving, innovation, and wealth creation.  They both require a strong work ethic, ambition, and infinite amount of caffeine.  Seriously though, there are quite a number of similarities, the difference is in their perspective on companies.  On Wall Street, it&#8217;s not about company building it&#8217;s about monetizing  companies. In Silicon Valley, it&#8217;s much more about the process of building great companies and taking the risk to get those companies to the point where Wall Street can monetize them. As a result, you see major differences in the way bankers think about companies and the way VCs and Silicon Valley think about companies. </span></p>\n<p><b>So, I feel like Silicon Valley gets a little bit of flack for building products that are a bit self-serving—like delivering bananas to that bowl or whatever [chuckles]. What has it been like in your experience building something that&#8217;s the opposite, like building for a user case and an experience that many people in Silicon Valley can&#8217;t relate to?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s right or wrong—I think a lot of these companies in the Valley, while they may seem self-serving,—entrepreneurs solve problems they know. So I don&#8217;t look at products like people delivering bananas as a bad thing. I think there&#8217;s a demand for convenience, and potentially time and cost savings being created for consumers.  Somebody is getting enough value out of that service for them to be willing to pay for it. As a capitalist, I understand the value of those companies but as a social entrepreneur, those aren&#8217;t necessarily companies that I would start, because for me, I&#8217;m excited about creating value, not only to my investors, but also for society in a way that creates systems change.  How can we serve the segment of the population that need help the most in a way that exponentially improve their lives and their children’s lives?  That’s the question that drives me, but I also have different life experiences that has made that a top priority for me.  So I think the rap is probably not fairly deserved because there are a ton of companies in the Valley that are equally creating solutions and products that are going to fundamentally alter and improve our lives. Like entrepreneurs who build companies to solve problems they know, investors fund companies that are solving problems they know.  I mean it&#8217;s normal. If you&#8217;re an investor and you can see the problem, you can empathize with the problem, you understand the market, you understand the market opportunity, it’s easier for you to say, &#8220;Yeah, I get this.&#8221; Big market? Yes. Great team? Yes. Great product? Yes. Does it solve a problem? Yes. It&#8217;s even harder when you&#8217;re selling or building a product that, the people you&#8217;re trying to pitch cannot identify with. It&#8217;s not easily understood.  Also, being an outsider adds another layer of difficulty.</span></p>\n<p><b>How has that impacted fundraising and building the company?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have to pitch probably five times more people. It&#8217;s a longer process, it&#8217;s much more difficult, but you have to believe in what you&#8217;re doing.  The general belief is that if they&#8217;re in financial distress, they may be dead beats and not pay back their debt. We had to prove that consumers who are dealing with financial distress, are not dishonorable people, there’s just a gap between intent and capacity. The intent is there, the capacity isn&#8217;t. We are bridging that intent-capacity gap..</span></p>\n<p><b>On the positive side, what has been the most exciting and activating things about your work as an entrepreneur and within the subject matter that we&#8217;re working on?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know, when you pick up the phone and you&#8217;re talking to an individual who’s going through this major life circumstance but you clearly can tell they’re looking for a solution.  We had a client preparing for his wife’s kidney transplant surgery and recovery process and to hear him say that they&#8217;re on the list 18 months out, but he&#8217;s preparing now for that imminent event, knowing that his cash flow will be less, or as a household will be less in 18 months; when you are engaging with clients like that, and you are able to provide solutions that help them get relief and help them prepare, I mean, that&#8217;s incredible. Our mission internally is, deliver financial health, it&#8217;s that simple. As a company, that&#8217;s all we&#8217;re going to be focused on doing, bringing products to market that will deliver financial health. And to be able to engage someone and hear that story, and provide a solution that helps him during this critical, stressful moment—and to hear that relief when you say, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re going to give you the loan, and this is how much we&#8217;re going to settle for you, and this is what the loan is going to be, etc.&#8221; It&#8217;s rewarding and every day, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing. So it&#8217;s exciting. It&#8217;s hard work [chuckles]. Don&#8217;t get me wrong. It&#8217;s really hard work, but it&#8217;s exciting to be able to help people and make money doing it.</span></p>\n<p><b>This question kind of comes from my own personal experience of feeling otherness—we talked about this at coffee—and generally feeling like an outsider. You kind of touched on this with not going to Ivy League, and you&#8217;re working on a product that maybe not everyone can empathize with. I&#8217;m curious how that contributes to any feelings of otherness that you may feel, or whether or not you&#8217;ve found support networks that totally balance that out.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s certainly a feeling of otherness. When I moved here, I had a few friends in the Bay Area, but I wasn&#8217;t part of the network. There&#8217;s some otherness in that you&#8217;re solving a problem that is much different, and so it&#8217;s outside of the Valley’s box. You&#8217;re also an entrepreneur who looks different than in the “prototype”. If you&#8217;re saying the data says, &#8221;if this person looks like this, and acts like this, and has this type of product, this background, there&#8217;s a strong likelihood of success,” then I get it but &#8221;data is inherently biased.&#8221; So I think that aspect of otherness: if you can&#8217;t, again, empathize with the product, you can&#8217;t empathize with the solution and you can&#8217;t empathize with the entrepreneur bringing that product to market, it&#8217;s human nature to not be as excited about what the potential for that solution may be. The feeling of otherness is certainly there, you learn to block it out. As an entrepreneur, you&#8217;re overcoming obstacles daily. That&#8217;s your job. It&#8217;s, overcome obstacles or die. There&#8217;s no clear path to that solution. There&#8217;s no clear path to where you&#8217;re going. You&#8217;re forging that every day. I acknowledge the otherness, and certainly knowing what that entails allows you to prepare for it, but it means that you have to be open to figuring out solutions and working hard. And put your head down and get to that point where you can prove to others that this is the right solution. In terms of feeling of otherness, I think it&#8217;s just a matter of acknowledging it, like anything else prepare for it, and then just move forward. You can&#8217;t control it so there&#8217;s no point in wasting time trying to— time is your most precious resource as an entrepreneur, so you just put your head down and go to work.</span></p>\n<p><b>What other kind of big lessons have you learned in your years as an entrepreneur? You just spat out some good ones.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&#8217;s see. Big lessons&#8230;</span></p>\n<p><b>What do you wish you had known early on?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First and foremost, entrepreneurs are inherently optimists. And so the process can be—not can be, will be difficult, and for an optimist it bodes well because you always think you&#8217;ll be able to overcome it. But I don&#8217;t think you realize how much time it really will take initially, nor that you appreciate at the outset how hard it is to build a company and to build a culture and to build a product that people want and so forth. And so I think the main thing is you have to be committed to what you&#8217;re doing. You have to believe in yourself despite the many no&#8217;s you&#8217;ll get, despite the doubts you&#8217;ll hear. You have to believe in what you&#8217;re doing. You have to be consistent, and you have to get up and go to work everyday. And just be laser focused on what you&#8217;re doing and not allow the noise to get in the way—which isn’t easy—I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s one entrepreneur who can say that they don&#8217;t allow the noise to impact them. Even some of the most successful ones, after learning that, you still do it. If you could figure out how to minimize that impact of the noise daily, then, you&#8217;re better off for it. I think also, more importantly, entrepreneurship is really a passion. It&#8217;s not something you can just do half-heartedly. It&#8217;s tough. It&#8217;s a long road, it&#8217;s a long journey and every bit of it is earned. Nothing is given to you. At least, those are the lessons that I’ve learned over the time.</span></p>\n<p><b>This is so good. Okay. How do you think the coordination of background and life experiences impact the way you approach your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. I mean. The combination of my life experiences. It&#8217;s being myself, living with parents who were working two jobs to make ends meet and to make sure you had a roof over your head, have food, and was focused on your education— but also, dealing with financial problems, right? And—  coming from a country that’s the poorest in the Western Hemisphere, but the one thing you learn if you ever visit Haiti is the people, regardless of how poor they may be, are proud, and there&#8217;s a strong sense of happiness. There&#8217;s also a strong sense of resourcefulness in those individuals that every day, as hard as it may be, they don&#8217;t whine and they don&#8217;t complain. They wake up every day with a smile. They wake up every day and do whatever it takes to see the next day and to survive and work through it. And so I think that&#8217;s inherent. I mean, I would say if there was a DNA model for an entrepreneur; that is it, resourcefulness and every day waking up regardless of the circumstances, and trying to figure out a solution to a problem. And so all of that I sort of attribute to my upbringing, both here in the States, as well as in Haiti, and to my parents. And I think it&#8217;s also a culmination of the professional experiences that I&#8217;ve had. It&#8217;s working in corporate finance, and then working on Wall Street, helping big businesses restructure and refinance, and taking some of those lessons and saying, how do we apply that to the consumer space and give consumers the same solutions that we&#8217;re giving the major companies? Yeah, so I think I&#8217;ve been lucky. I&#8217;ve been on both sides. I grew up in a country that is very poor, and I&#8217;ve been on the other side where I&#8217;ve worked on Wall Street, where you&#8217;re dealing with billions and billions of dollars every day. And so being able to see both sides is to me, a uniquely competitive advantage, because it allows me to empathize but also understand the mechanics to be able to deliver a solution—a complex solution, simplified into a product that can serve the people who need it the most.</span></p>\n<p><b>I can&#8217;t stop thinking about that concept that we first talked about of VCs what they can relate to. And I&#8217;m just so curious to hear your thoughts, based on your experiences or just what you&#8217;ve observed overall in the industry, of how cognitive diversity or socioeconomic diversity—or just whatever in VC—would impact what companies are funded and what products are funded.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think we&#8217;re starting to see a bit more of that, the VCs are acknowledging that diversity is important in the room when the decisions are being made. I mean, there are a lot of companies that, like us, that had difficulty raising capital but have managed to raise some capital, and have proven that there&#8217;s a market—there&#8217;s a big business—to be had in that space. If there&#8217;s a voice in the room who understands the market, who&#8217;s had that experience, who can see the opportunity, who can understand the complexity of the problem and whether or not that solution truly solves it—I think it&#8217;s easier as an entrepreneur to walk in and say, &#8220;here&#8217;s the problem and here&#8217;s the solution.&#8221; All of us can put up charts, and show numbers, but if the VC sitting in the room just can&#8217;t get the solution, and can&#8217;t understand the problem, no matter how great your product is it&#8217;d go on deaf ears. I think it&#8217;s important that the VC ranks and the VC firms certainly have diverse individuals of various backgrounds: socioeconomic backgrounds, race, and gender. As a company, we are incredibly focused on having a diverse workforce because I truly believe all of us are unique—our experiences are the lenses through which we see the world.  It&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve seen, what we&#8217;ve experienced, what we&#8217;ve done that allows us to comprehend and empathize and make decisions. The more shades of lenses that you have in the room, the better to be able to really see the light, I guess.</span></p>\n<p><b>Okay. My last question would be, what advice would you have for kids who come from where you&#8217;re from or come from similar backgrounds, who are just hoping to get into tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. Exposure is everything, right? I wouldn&#8217;t be doing what I&#8217;m doing if I hadn&#8217;t been exposed to what we were doing on Wall Street. Exposure is everything. So I think the earlier you can get exposure to what it is that you aspire to do— so for me it was, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going to be a doctor. So I&#8217;m going to enroll in this magnet program.&#8221; Then through that exposure I realized, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t want to do this.&#8221; Then I thought, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going to be an agent.&#8221; I got some exposure to that and realized, &#8220;Ugh, I don&#8217;t want to do this.&#8221; I think exposure is incredibly important. Experience is crucial to really understand what it is that you want to do. We all may think this is what we want to do, but only because it&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been exposed to. We have a narrow view of what the opportunities are in the world and what it is we really want to do. And I think for people coming from my background or young people who are trying to break in, it&#8217;s all about finding a way to get an opportunity and not giving up. Be resourceful, talk to people, and find mentors. I wouldn&#8217;t be here if I didn&#8217;t have the mentors who guided me along the way. And I wouldn&#8217;t be here if it wasn&#8217;t for our first investor who I met in Haiti through a friend while visiting and kept in touch with and became friends with—we would sit down and have lunch and he became a mentor, and he just said, &#8220;Look, I really believe in you; I really believe in what you&#8217;re doing, and I&#8217;m going to write a check.&#8221; And that was it. He provided the spark for us to eventually get here. But without him, I don&#8217;t think we would have ever gotten off the ground, quite frankly. So the key is to network, find people who can provide you with different experiences; different exposure, be resourceful—don&#8217;t wait. Take initiative. Research what it is that you&#8217;re interested in. Really become an expert and learn about it—be able to think through it and talk about it intelligently. And, most importantly, believe in yourself—have the confidence to go for what you want. No one can stop you. No one will stop you. Just believe you can do it, and just take the leap.</span></p>",

Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. So I grew up in Daly City. So it&#8217;s a suburb right outside of San Francisco. So definitely, now, I claim to be a San Franciscan. But regardless I have seen this city sort of change both for good, for bad. It&#8217;s quite different, I&#8217;m sure that everyone can sort of speak to that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I grew up probably middle class. My mom had a little bit more—my mom was actually the only primary breadwinner in the family. My dad didn&#8217;t make much money. He couldn&#8217;t hold a consistent job. But my mom did have a really, really good job for a while for a lot of my childhood. We were maybe middle to—for a time—upper middle class and then my mom lost her job. And from there it was just a struggle to like, &#8220;Okay, this is how people actually live in the real world. I need to go actually get a loan for college.&#8221; Totally normal stuff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think the biggest thing I think back on a specific instance of me moving to a primarily white upper middle class neighborhood in high school and getting a free workshop for the SATs. That I think significantly gets me to where I am. And that&#8217;s not like an imposter syndrome like, &#8220;How do I belong here&#8221;, sort of thing. I think that&#8217;s actual fact. Mostly because if I hadn&#8217;t done that I wouldn&#8217;t have even known that there are resources or workshops like that in the high school that are was supposed to go to in South San Francisco, If there were, you paid for stuff like that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess what I&#8217;m trying to say is, you don&#8217;t know really—I feel like you&#8217;re so sheltered in these lower middle class areas that you really only think about surviving. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you grow up with scarcity mentality, this idea of “finding your passion” or “following your dreams” is a luxury that is almost always incomprehensible. I can’t worry about what makes me feel most alive when I’m concerned about making enough money to stay alive.</span></i> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sad thing is, we exaggerate anxieties; I’m nowhere near running out of food, and yet I still find myself struggling to relinquish ideas around wanting/needing more. More money. More recognition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I got my first contract job at Google, I was blown away. I totally bought into the Kool-Aid, I was just like, “I&#8217;m just going to hang out here on my rainbow-colored bike and just sip on this Kool-Aid for a second. I’ll catch you later.” My friends were impressed, my family was impressed; it was an ego boost. All my relatives wanted to come by for the free food, and asked if we really did laundry and yoga at work, and my mom was like, &#8220;Can you bring me some sandwiches home?&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No, that&#8217;s stealing, Mom.&#8221; [chuckles] It was a cushy job at an amazing company. But I was miserable. I wasn’t being challenged in my work, and I didn’t care much about my work, but I stayed because it was stable and sexy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dropbox is so much smaller and you are in the heart of San Francisco. A bunch of the engineers that I had met early on and became friends with were these dudes had the personality archetype of very funny, very witty, extremely sarcastic, does cool things on the weekends, hits up some of the music festivals when they&#8217;re in town, hangs out on a SF rooftop with a beer with some friends and watch blue angels. You know what I mean? Like, everyone kind of does—it&#8217;s the same kind of person, but it&#8217;s great. I love them, and we have very insightful conversations, but at the same time, yeah, I guess I don&#8217;t really feel like a lot of these things that they&#8217;ve experienced—though when you start talking about like people going to boarding school, I&#8217;ve never actually met anyone who actually went to boarding school. I was like, &#8220;I thought that was just a thing that was in like old British movies.&#8221; No, people have gotten to British schools here—or boarding schools. Yeah, and just—yeah, again, just people talking about growing up with horses And when you start digging into that, it&#8217;s definitely one of those things that you don&#8217;t really talk about in tech. It&#8217;s like you kind of see each other as coworkers, but then it gets kind of uncomfortable in if you start digging into, well, what was your background? So it&#8217;s interesting. It&#8217;s a very interesting type of friendship that you have when you start getting into the tech world, at least for my experience.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t really see people like me. Like the other Filipinos are cooks in the kitchen, people who clean up the dishes after everyone who eats  Yeah, like the janitors, and maybe a couple other people in finance. But you don&#8217;t really see people—I don&#8217;t feel like I see people like myself there.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>What is your experience as a Filipino American in tech, and how does that contribute to a feeling of otherness? I kind of want to hear that experience. Do you experience the same kind of isolation that we talked about earlier?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. How do I start with this? The first is that I feel otherness, but I&#8217;ve had to sort of dig into it. Because if I&#8217;m being absolutely honest with myself, I have felt the need to assimilate. And by that I mean I want to take on a similar lifestyle of people that I work with because it&#8217;s easier that way, right? And it&#8217;s easier to have the same sort of conversations with everyone if they are the typical ones that you would have. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or—yeah, getting involved in SF culture; These are all things that I feel I have somehow over the years, sort of assimilated to. But when you start getting into conversations around who I&#8217;m going to hang out with people,  and I can&#8217;t because I have an aunt&#8217;s family party, they&#8217;re like,&#8221;Didn&#8217;t you just have an aunt&#8217;s family party?&#8221;,&#8221;yeah, I&#8217;ve got like 20 aunts.&#8221; There are things about the Filipino culture that definitely are still a part of my life, but I have had to dig into the other [?] and fit—have to be very starkly honest with myself around how I have modified my identity to try to fit into tech.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In terms of representation, you don&#8217;t really see other Filipinos and I feel like the thing that I&#8217;ve struggled most with is feeling lumped into the entire majority of Asians in tech, because when you ask people about people in tech, it&#8217;s white people, it&#8217;s Asians, and Indians. And it leaves me feeling like—Because there are so many other underrepresented groups, no one ever really dissects to realize that Asians comprises so much more. And I&#8217;m not just talking about being Filipino, I&#8217;m talking about being Thai, being Laotian, these Southeast Asian countries where you haven&#8217;t had the same sort of—You don&#8217;t have that same reputation of being this intellectually driven, you work really hard, tiger mom, tiger dad culture. And so they&#8217;re very very different things when you start getting down to the thick of it, right? So when people say &#8220;Well, why would you need a mentor? Why would you need these resources?&#8221; Because I haven&#8217;t had the same set of resources, or I didn&#8217;t have the same upbringing as a lot of my Asian friends who stayed home their entire childhood and lives to study. Because again, that&#8217;s not ingrained in the Filipino culture. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s interesting because your parents want the best for you and say &#8220;You have to be a doctor or you have to be a lawyer,&#8221; and it&#8217;s back to what I was saying about getting from point A to point B, but they don&#8217;t actually integrate or embed any sort of tactics to get you there. You&#8217;re just kind of like have these expectations, and then you&#8217;re supposed to figure it out. They don&#8217;t sit—How do I say this? You can probably ask a lot of Filipinos, and their parents were worried about so many other things, like making ends meet or caring for four other siblings, or caring for their grandparents. A lot of Filipinos take care of their grandparents. And so you don&#8217;t really have the same sort of upbringing with Filipino parents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And on that note another thing that&#8217;s very different between Filipinos and the upbringing of some of my other friends like Vietnamese, or Chinese, or Korean is that Filipinos don&#8217;t really tried to preserve their culture. They come from a long history of colonization. A lot of Filipino Americans now, what their expense was like growing up, a lot of them would tell you that their parents actually tried to force them to assimilate, rather than preserve their culture. So a lot of Filipinos Americans don&#8217;t actually know Tagalog which is the primary Filipino language. Because the parents wanted them to learn English. It was about fitting in. It was about try to fit into this American culture. It&#8217;s interesting because a while I don&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s much of representation fulfilled for Filipinos. I also don&#8217;t feel like Filipinos in general have much of an identity or they don&#8217;t really celebrate any sort of traditions. Because they come from sort of all over. When you think about Filipinos intact again a lot of them are going to be people in the service industry and very few professionals. There are people like me, other people I can talk to about everything I kind of just told you. It’s like, &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it kind of crazy that our parents didn&#8217;t really look over our shoulders studying?&#8221; And like, &#8220;How did you break through that?&#8221; Well, I was hoping, because I know that actually I sort of found some sort of odd way into it.</span></p>\n<p><b>Have you found that support network yet?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not really, no. I met a few Filipino professionals in Tech by doing cool things and then had had a conversation with them. But there&#8217;s never been any sort of concerted effort to band together or form some sort of group. Almost because everyone&#8217;s so busy just trying to continue to make this life for themselves, and are so busy trying to keep up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And I wonder if that kind of childhood pressure to assimilate carries through into Tech. I&#8217;m just like, what is it that I&#8217;m supposed to do.</span></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s both a desire to assimilate and a desire to find stability, right? Again, I just happen to be lucky in that Tech was the stable option, but a lot of my decisions up until now have been based on, you know, is this a stable option and up until recently was based on like, &#8220;Will this make me look good?&#8221;</p>\n<p><b>How do your friends and family in general feel about the work that you&#8217;ve done, and where you&#8217;ve ended up?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s actually a really interesting thing, because I feel like both people in our community, and also people at Berkeley have a—or a lot of people that I hung out with at Berkeley, I hung out at a lot of student organizations of color, coming out of school I was so conflicted because I felt like I had to do something to help the world, or help my community, or help those people who haven&#8217;t had these opportunities. When I moved into the tech world I sort of felt like I was selling out. Because then I was making this stable income doing something that I totally hated. My best friend, for example, is applying to law school to go be an advocate for people who—like  refugees and people who—basically the type of people who need the help. I&#8217;m over here like—She&#8217;s working crazy hours and I&#8217;m over here saying that I don&#8217;t whine as much as I&#8217;ve heard other people at work whine, but I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, we had salmon again today.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I guess just what I&#8217;m trying to say is that it was—it&#8217;s weird because no one really gets what I do. Right? Or not that they don&#8217;t get what I do but I am working within this bubble and the work that I am doing is not—it doesn&#8217;t have the same sort of weight as my best friend trying to go to law school, truly like fight the good fight. So people are always more interested in my perks than what I actually do, which is interesting. Does that make sense? They want to know, &#8220;Oh cool do you love working at Google? Do you love working at Dropbox? Is it true that you get free meals everyday?&#8221; No one is really interested in the work that I do. Does that make sense? It&#8217;s—and I wonder why—and by that I mean like friend, family—they all know that I have this  cushy, according to them, job where I get everything that I want, so it almost makes me feel kind of guilty about it, which is a really interesting conflict and complex to have, I think.</span></p>\n<p><b>What is it like for you being a local in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a local and being in tech has the same kind of theme of another struggle, which is having come from a place like UC Berkeley where we were protesting every other week: tuition hikes, or protesting the lack of East-Asian studies in the school. We were highly, highly political, very progressive, definitely your Bernie Sanders types of folks. That was absolutely my values, and so when I joined tech, I felt like I had sold out. I was still seeing a lot of Facebook posts like, &#8220;Get the techies out of San Francisco, they&#8217;re ruining our city.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was interesting, soon after I joined Dropbox, there was this whole, &#8220;Dropboxers kick the Mission kids out of their soccer fields.&#8221; Then all of my friends from college—they weren&#8217;t giving me shit, personally, but they were posting about it. It was such a weird place to be where I could relate to both sides. Maybe not necessarily relate to both but have that empathy towards both. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back in 2012-13, I used to tell people, &#8220;I love San Francisco. It&#8217;s such a wonderful city.&#8221; It&#8217;s crazy because everyone from all different walks of earth can co-habitate, right? The artists, the Latino families. And at the time there weren&#8217;t too many techies, but the techies and even some finance people, and they all kind of live in harmony. You can be a weirdo, you can let your freak flag fly. And it&#8217;s wonderful and everyone was in harmony. And now that image, that perception I had of the city that I was bragging about, that is not there any more. Because it is a city ridden with animosity and tension. And all these wonderful groups that used that used to kind of just respect each other, and be like, &#8220;Okay, yeah. You do you. I&#8217;m going to do me. I&#8217;ll be over here,&#8221; and hate each other now. It&#8217;s such a political thing. </span></p>\n<p><b>How do you think your background and life experiences impact the way that you approach your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that the way that I approach my work comes from a very—maybe not stability, but a &#8216;am I safe&#8217; type of mindset. I&#8217;ve gotten a lot better at being able to take more risks or be more creative, but generally speaking, I felt like I was almost like having a position where I was needing to either prove myself or that I didn&#8217;t really belong. Who am I to have these same sort of opinions or try to look at the data the same way someone at Harvard who studied finance does? I didn&#8217;t feel like I really, truly had a voice or had validity in what I was saying. Or credibility. At the same time, I think that having the background or having my mom who was just a beast, providing for four kids without my dad&#8217;s help, basically. You have that hard working mentality and you want to work hard for the sake of working hard and for the sake of proving that I&#8217;m not of less value than some of these other people. I think that aside from the way that I work, the way that I interact with people can be very different. It&#8217;s actually pretty surprising to me, but I have heard of instances of  people treating the janitorial staff and the women who clean the bathrooms, and people who pick after us are very, very , very badly. Or not looking them in the eye when you—when they see them, or they say hi hand scuffing at them. I have had that happen in the workplace. It&#8217;s so interesting because it&#8217;s not just about treating other humans with respect, but these are also people that I feel like I can relate to because they look like me. Because I can talk to them about rap songs that we hear because they listen to the same type of music.</span></p>\n<p><b>Adding you to my list of people who will get my rap jokes. Most people I know don’t understand half the things I’m referencing. It’s sad.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No one gets my rap jokes either. They&#8217;re like the only people who like my captions when I like post something like 2 Chains or Drake oriented like, &#8220;What are you talking about? You&#8217;re so random dear, you&#8217;re so random.&#8221; No, actually. No Actually. It’s a rap song. It&#8217;s an important part of culture.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b></b><b>Okay, so why don&#8217;t we start at the beginning? Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My early years, I grew up in New Jersey, in the farm country of New Jersey. George Washington marched down Main Street in the town that I grew up in, so it&#8217;s incredibly insulated, affluent area—very straight, very normative. I lived there until I went to college.</span></p>\n<p><b>What was your childhood like? Were you feeling totally isolated in childhood or were you feeling pretty normal?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had a sibling and we&#8217;re close in age. We&#8217;re a year apart &#8211; a year and four months. That alleviated some of the feeling of isolation, but it took 30 minutes to get to the supermarket by car so it was hard not to feel isolated. My parents divorced and it took them about eight years. They were locked in our custody battle and it was really acrimonious. That started when I was in second or third grade and went on for a while, so that was tough too. Yeah.</span></p>\n<p><b>How did you first discover tech? What was the early entry point into the world you are in now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My entry point to technology came really late. We had a computer in our house, a Compaq, but it was in my dad&#8217;s office. My brother and I would only get to play video games on it once a week. We played that video game <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst\" target=\"_blank\">Myst</a>. It was really hard. I didn&#8217;t have a cellphone until the middle or end of high school. My first regular access to a computer was in computer typing class. I remember those.</span></p>\n<p><b>Oh yeah. I was so good at typing class.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah [chuckles]. The typing programs. It wasn&#8217;t really a huge part of my life. We didn&#8217;t even really have cable growing up. I think it may have come later than other kids. Really, these memories may be similar to other millennials like dial-up internet, first AIM screen name, going into chat rooms. My brother and I, we&#8217;d go into chat rooms and type in ASL [age/sex/location], try to flirt with people, and that was always fun.  That was the beginning, I think, like teens. But even still, there was only one computer in the house and limited access.</span></p>\n<p><b>It sounds very similar to my upbringing. What was your first AIM screen name?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh my God, dogluvr [chuckles]. But, it was&#8211;</span></p>\n<p><b>No numbers?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8230;L-U-V-R [chuckles].</span></p>\n<p><b>Wow. That&#8217;s good. I was maybe too late to the game to grab sunnygirl sans numbers, so I had to do sunnygirl87 which is ironic because I don&#8217;t even like sunlight.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[laughs]</span></p>\n<p><b>Then I became puddinpie, because I loved pudding and I loved pie. Puddinpie26.</b></p>\n<p>Oh my God [laughs].</p>\n<p><b>Yeah. So many good ones.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, I love how they&#8217;re so naive, like so earnest, all of them. They&#8217;re great.</span></p>\n<p><b>Did you have early inclinations about what you wanted to do, or be, when you grow up, and did you have any family pressure in any particular direction?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. My parents are very&#8211; they&#8217;re lawyers. They, like I said, they divorced, and they both remarried lawyers. They&#8217;re very much people that have always been on a track and expect everyone else to be on a track. I think they expected that I&#8217;d be a lawyer. I wanted to be a writer or a poet, definitely had more artistic inclinations.</span></p>\n<p><b>So walk me through the winding path of you getting into tech.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh my God, I&#8217;ve started interviewing people at SoundCloud and I get asked that a lot and you would think that would help me crystalize my own answer by now but I&#8217;m still finding my way through it. I graduated college in 2010, that was deep in the recession and I was living in New York at the time, the first job I was able to get was working at a Borders before they went out of business. I was one of the people at the front with a Walkie Talkie that was busting shoplifters, that was my first job.</span></p>\n<p><b>Amazing.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then Borders folded and I just kind of took any job I could get &#8211; I went job to job and eventually decided to move out to the Bay area like typical Bay area story, no job, no place to live. All of my friends were giving me the advice to apply for things in tech because it was casting a line into to a larger pond. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first job in tech I got was at this company called <a href=\"https://www.codeforamerica.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Code for America</a>. It&#8217;s like a non-profit tech company [chuckles]. Sounds like an oxymoron, it is an oxymoron. I was there for a year and a half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m a huge music nerd and decided I want to work in music tech, and that&#8217;s how I got into SoundCloud. It&#8217;s pretty lucky, when I look back on it now. I didn&#8217;t have any connections and being in tech has made me realize how nepotistic it is, and it&#8217;s all about who you know. I applied completely blind with just a cover letter and resume, and ended up getting the job. I work on their Community team, which is tech jargon for customer service. [chuckles]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve been doing that for the last two years. That was a really quick synopsis, but there have been other detours&#8211; I thought I wanted to work in book publishing when I graduated from school and  I worked at Random House in New York City and I was doing book publishing for a while and then I think moving out here and being unemployed, it felt like tech was my only option, which is how it is, but I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s almost like I made the choice, but the choice also happened to me.</span></p>\n<p><b>I probably use SoundCloud more than any other app total I think.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wow.</span></p>\n<p><b>I know. Well, I have music tastes that tend to surprise people—so when people want to know what kind of music I listen to, I&#8217;m like… the only way I even know how to begin explaining this is just to point you to SoundCloud and go look at my likes.</b></p>\n<p><b>Anyway. What are some of the most exciting things to you about either your job specifically or working in this kind of industry? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I work in a niche inside technology, like music tech is a niche within the broader tech industry. I am excited by the fact that I&#8217;m actually passionate about the area of technology that I work in. I could be working in consumer tech or something where I feel absolutely nothing about what I&#8217;m doing. I feel good about that.</span></p>\n<p><b>What would have been some of your biggest struggles during your time in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, man. The feeling of loneliness. SoundCloud is based in Berlin and I work in the San Francisco office and that&#8217;s an office of 20 people. I was one of the first out LGBT people at the office so there was a loneliness in that. Then </span><em>it took me a year to come out to everyone as being gender queer, which is on the trans spectrum, and asking everyone to call me by gender neutral pronouns. That was a further segmentation of loneliness. That&#8217;s been hard. There have been moments of friction and&#8211; misunderstanding and just ignorance along the way, for sure.</em></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m curious to know, where you have found your support networks during these times? I know that you formed one on your own.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s a really good question. Yeah, I ended up forming a diversity resource group with two other LGBT employees at SoundCloud at the time, which is crazy in a company of 250 people. But there were only three of us, and that was a support network. I have a really rich queer community outside of work, a really amazing, supportive girlfriend. All those things definitely strengthen me.</span></p>\n<p><b>What is it like in your experience being deeply involved in two different communities of two very different levels of privilege? You&#8217;ve got tech and you&#8217;ve got the queer community—what’s it like to straddle both?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. Even outside of non queer spaces, these days I&#8217;m just incredibly reticent to say that I work in tech. I think in queer spaces and at queer parties, I feel that friction a lot too. I feel like&#8211; there are queer people who work in tech, obviously, but I think most of the queer folks in the community want to think of themselves as activists and disruptors and—oh, cute cat.</span></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s Raphael.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or artists. Not to say that you can&#8217;t be all those things, like an activist and a disruptor and a artist and work in tech, but I think there&#8217;s a perception in the queer community that you can&#8217;t and it feels a little like it&#8217;s&#8211; like you can&#8217;t hold both spaces. I have a dialogue with myself about this almost daily but I tell myself, </span><em>&#8220;you are disrupting things just by virtue of stepping out, educating people on trans identity, and advocating for yourself and just getting in people&#8217;s faces and bringing things to light that would have never surfaced before.&#8221;</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I do feel like I&#8217;m disrupting and I do feel like I&#8217;m agitating things and I think that is a form of activism. But, in the two-minute elevator spiel of someone else who&#8217;s in the bar, I just sound like a yuppie, so it&#8217;s incredibly nuanced and a really frustrating thing to for sure.</span></p>\n<p><b>What do you think are your biggest motivators?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At work or just life, both?</span></p>\n<p><b>In life, what drives you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coffee. I have like a severe caffeine problem. [laughter]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I take a lot of pride in being a good child, and sibling, and partner, and friend. That&#8217;s something that drives me. I know that sounds a little corny but that&#8217;s a huge source of pride for me. Also just the fight to be seen, that too.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That moment when it finally clicks for someone. That&#8217;s happened a few times at work now, where after a lot of correction and a lot of nudging, they finally adapt, really ‘see’ you, and evolve in your direction. </span><em>People start calling me &#8220;they&#8221; and they make me feel like they finally see me. That&#8217;s a motivator.<b> </b></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That makes it all worth it.</span></p>\n<p><b>How has coming out affected your perspectives on equality in the workplace?</b></p>\n<p>I mean, I don&#8217;t know, I feel like there&#8217;s nothing I can say that hasn&#8217;t been said. Like, my workplace, Soundcloud, and other tech companies are incredibly white and male-dominated. All the leaders, for the most part, are white and male, and yeah, there are all kinds of ceilings that are yet to be shattered or even acknowledged before they can be shattered. Yeah, it&#8217;s hard working in a place where you feel the oppressiveness of all these different kinds of ceilings that exist for you, but you can&#8217;t really talk about it or acknowledge them, and that&#8217;s what it feels like. And I see those ceilings, and they&#8217;re not always just my own, but for people who are completely female identified, those ceilings exist and, yeah, there are just different kinds of ceilings and hurdles and it&#8217;s just funny because there&#8217;s also a ton of talk about diversity and inclusion right now. I feel like in the last year the discussion about diversity and inclusion in tech has just completely taken off, and for all this talk and conjecture, you would expect some more acknowledgement of the ceilings and hurdles that I&#8217;m talking about, but there&#8217;s a ton of talk and conjecture and it doesn&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s a lot of change or momentum yet. So in terms of equality in the workplace, my perception is that there&#8217;s a lot of talk, but there&#8217;s yet to be much change. I mean, maybe the needle is just moving so slowly that it seems imperceptible, but I feel very impatient and weary a lot of the time with the theme of equality in the workplace.</p>\n<p><b>Have you had any particular mentors or people that you&#8217;ve looked up to for inspiration, or even just people that have been pivotal in your career?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have this theory about mentors. </span><em>It’s like—you know when you&#8217;re dating someone and you really like them and you just want to define the relationship and ask them to be your girlfriend, boyfriend, whatever. I feel like my past experience with mentors is I&#8217;ve done that and then scared them away, so lately I&#8217;ve had mentors and I just don&#8217;t tell them they&#8217;re my mentors. I have people that I look up to and look toward for inspiration. But they&#8217;re not formal mentors because I think defining the relationship kind of ruins it a little bit.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And yeah, there are just some badass women that work at SoundCloud &#8211; a lot of them have left &#8211; there&#8217;s a huge attrition problem. There&#8217;s a woman in our office who&#8217;s&#8211; it&#8217;s an open office floor plan and she&#8217;s taking calls and yelling at guys on the phone and making deals. She&#8217;s just taking up a lot of space in a way that I haven&#8217;t seen a woman do in a workplace&#8211; I&#8217;ve only ever seen men do that. She takes up space in every part of the office she&#8217;s in and it&#8217;s awesome. I&#8217;ve just never seen anything like it. There are just a lot of really assertive women that work at the company and that&#8217;s been cool to see.</span></p>\n<p><b>What is important in a job to you now versus when you started? Like what do you feel is really priority to you, either currently or in the future?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t want to settle for a job where I&#8217;m not a culture fit because I&#8217;ve done that too many times before. </span><em>I don&#8217;t expect to stay at SoundCloud forever but I am a culture fit, for the most part, in the office right now. Like I come in and I feel accepted and I have friends and this is the first job where I&#8217;ve ever had that and I don&#8217;t want to settle for not feeling like a culture fit anymore because culture really makes or breaks a job. It sounds so obvious but it took me like four years to realize that.</em></p>\n<p><b>How do your friends and family feel about the path that you&#8217;ve taken and the work that you&#8217;ve done? You&#8217;re not a lawyer.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think they&#8217;re proud of me. My parents are not super adept with technology. Neither of them know or use SoundCloud or know what it is so they don’t exactly understand what I do day-to-day but they appreciate the fact that I&#8217;m in an industry that&#8217;s well regarded and I&#8217;m making my way so they seem okay.</span></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s good. How do you think the culmination of your background and life experiences affect the way that you approach your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I mentioned, I work on the Community team so that means just writing with users but I ended up moving into a specialization track and I&#8217;m writing with users that are in crisis and I have to moderate content that they report like if they are being abused or harassed on the site or if they see hate speech or unlawful content, sexually explicit content, basically all the ways that SoundCloud can be misused, I write at those users and I moderate that content. </span><em>I definitely don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a coincidence because I think my background allows me to be really compassionate and empathetic and I think having experienced discrimination and having had things happen to me that are abusive in the world I think it gives me a unique ability to moderate things—I don&#8217;t know, I think it all ties together in some strange way.</em></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m curious to know what you feel like tech could do a better job of culturally.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Culturally? Like, broadly, it&#8217;s ideas of inclusivity. I mean I&#8217;ve interviewed at places in the past where you have to walk up a flight of stairs and there aren&#8217;t even accessible elevators and I just feel like there are all kinds of diversity that are thought of last or not at all. And there are the kinds of diversity that you can&#8217;t see. You know there&#8217;s mental illness and other kinds of illness that aren&#8217;t visible. So yeah, just broadening. I think diversity inclusion needs to be broadened and I think learning and development also needs to be brought in. There needs to be more rigorous sensitivity training done internally.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are you working on this year, either for work or for yourself?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I&#8217;m part of a support group for folks that are on the gender spectrum and we&#8217;ve all talked about making a zine and leaving it in lobbies of tech companies and just places around the city. So I really want to make that zine about gender and gender fluidity. That&#8217;s a huge goal. Yeah, also we&#8217;re working on bringing an external facilitator to this and having them do a training on trans-identity. A lot of people in the office, abroad especially, don&#8217;t understand what transgender means. Those are goals. I also played tennis for a lot of my youth and I really want to pick up tennis again.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in like 5 or 10 years? Do you think you&#8217;ll still be in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I want to work on diversity and inclusion in tech, full time. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to be able to do that at SoundCloud, sadly, so I&#8217;m starting to look around and ask myself, where can I do this and how can I do this? Who will give me that shot? And eventually in ten years I hope that I will have gone to a company, learned the ropes, and then go out and become an independent consultant or started my own consultancy or something.</span></p>\n<p><b>I love that.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I think in ten years I&#8217;ll be working alongside or with tech. But, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll be </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it anymore, strictly speaking.</span></p>\n<p><b>I had a question but I lost it. Hold on. After a few hours of interviews, sometimes things start getting a little Swiss cheesy.</b></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s see, my last question would be about like lessons you&#8217;ve learned and any advice that you&#8217;d have for folks who are just starting out in the industry or come from similar backgrounds to you or going through similar struggles?</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am still telling myself this now, but I think if someone who grew up and was socialized as a woman, I still fall into this trap of thinking I&#8217;m not good enough—basically imposter syndrome. I always applied for jobs that are exactly at the level that I&#8217;m at or slightly below. I&#8217;ve never applied for something that&#8217;s above my qualification level. I would advise someone who&#8217;s a woman or non-binary person to aim high, because I&#8217;m still learning how to do that and I&#8217;ve been out of school for almost six years and I&#8217;m still looking at things and applying to things that are just at my level. And, I think if you aim high, you&#8217;ll get farther faster.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born in Chico, California. My dad was the head of the chemistry department at California State University at Chico. As I got into primary school, my mother started running for elected seats like the school board, and ultimately she became Vice Mayor of Chico. But then, my father passed away when I was in fourth grade.  My mom, almost as soon as he passed away, started aggressively pursuing her career in politics, which took us down to Oakland. Her intention was to go to law school in San Francisco, but then she started working on people&#8217;s campaigns and got really involved in the State’s Democratic Party. Ultimately, by the time I was in high school, she was Treasurer and Chair of the California Democratic Party working with people like Nancy Pelosi and Jess Unruh. There were so many great characters I was exposed to and they all had incredibly strong belief systems. I had this highly active childhood with my mom, filled with democratic politics, but I was conflicted because my father&#8217;s parents, who were still a big part of my life, were staunch Republicans. So politics for me were very uncomfortable and I thought &#8220;Ah! Politics are horrible, and you shouldn&#8217;t talk about them because all people do is fight.&#8221; [chuckles]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wanted everybody to get along and I just wanted to be normal with a normal family. It seems I never got to be that way though &#8211; I had this big curly hair that kids at school made fun of- calling me names like tumbleweed and bushy. So in high school I wore it up in a ponytail braid really tight all the time. I was really self-conscious of it and tried to make it go away. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually as I was applying to college, I realized that my curly hair and my strange upbringing with just my sister and my mother, and all the characters in politics as well as my knowledge about it, was really making me different and it was becoming really fun.  When I got to college I picked a major that only had 13 people in it and was only offered at two schools in the nation at the time. I just liked doing these things that stood out or somehow made me stand out from the crowd even if just slightly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The major was cognitive science, which I got interested in because I was leaning toward computer science at the time, but thought the comp sci majors were boring and introverted. Cognitive science was neuroscience, philosophy, computer science, a lot of linguistics at the school that I was at, and cognitive psychology. There were people doing all kinds of research and studies of stroke victims, babies developing language, the brain, and psychology so the group seemed really alive and gregarious. We studied language in the human brain and how it’s organized – human language is the one thing that sets us apart from animals, so understanding its constructs and processing in the brain when applied to computer processing, helps to make computers smarter. It was the early days of artificial intelligence, and we had philosophy in order to contemplate if developments were limited or unlimited and the implications of the work. Now this multidisciplinary program exists at many schools and ironically CogSci is a big feeder to product roles in tech – it took me 20 years out of school to migrate into a role like that, though!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I got out of school I really just wanted to work and have stability, because I felt like my life had had a lot of instability. My mom’s political activities exposed me to a lot of hotels and their ballrooms for fundraisers, and I thought the hotel business looked like a lot of fun, so I went and worked for hotels – I know, funny choice for a Cognitive Science major. Hotels, though, gave me this intense appreciation for problem solving with people. In hotels, you&#8217;re working face to face with guests, and in the service industry it&#8217;s all about your guest and being an advocate for your customer &#8211; figuring out what they need before they need it. It was a nice way to start out my career, and customer advocacy is something I&#8217;ve taken with me to every role since.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In particular in tech when I got there, it was so far from customer empathy because everybody was just trying to figure out the coding of our web site and back end systems. All the mind-share went to the complexity of the technology and it was very common for everybody to disregard the customer. Really, when we did take the time to think about the customer in the early days of tech, or at least in my early days, it was just this revolutionary thing that impressed people[chuckles]. Meanwhile, hospitality and  the retail world had been doing it for years so it was fun to bring that to tech. </span></p>\n<p><strong>So walk me through your early years in tech and some of the foundation you helped lay for e-commerce.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would say I was a part of it, but I don&#8217;t ever feel like I made things happen on my own across eCommerce. It&#8217;s so funny when you get out of the Bay Area and look at the industry from the outside. It really does look revolutionary, but when you&#8217;re in the middle of it you feel like you&#8217;re just part of a big team, or part of a company that&#8217;s doing new things (sometimes in really messy ways), but you don&#8217;t realize how new they are, but then they become the norm everywhere else down the road.  eCommerce has been like that for me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first startup that I did was an online drugstore (more.com – more than a drugstore, just a click away…), and we were competing with PlanetRX and Drugstore.com. It was the early days of the dotcom bubble and we were heavily funded, which gave us a lot of money to acquire customers and we did just that.  Customers back then were unsure of the world wide web, let alone buying from it, but we had a fair share of early adopters. I was responsible for customer operations and on my first day my boss said to me &#8220;Oh, we have this typical merchandising success situation on our hands where we&#8217;ve launched the store and the customers are responding very positively, but  we&#8217;re out of inventory so we&#8217;re not able to fulfill the orders.&#8221; In other words, we had customers ready to buy, but we didn&#8217;t have the product to ship. Having come from the catalogue business, where my boss and I had worked together I said, &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s find a way to delight the customers and make sure that they&#8217;ll give us another chance and come back.&#8221; For this group of customers, and I don&#8217;t remember how many it was, and this was not a sustainable solution at all, we sent them an apology letter with a crisp $10 bill. We sent this little bribe to every single customer who didn’t get their order. In typical dot.com fashion, the idea was to get their attention, delight or surprise, then let them know that we cared about them. It is kind of appalling now, if you think about sending cash in the mail to your customer, but at the time, we wanted to make a big impact so he/she would remember who we were and get some cash to boot so they could get the product they needed that we couldn’t provide.  Customers loved it and held out to order from us again. It was very scrappy and a low-tech way to respond to a real customer problem without requiring technology, which would have taken too much time.  We needed to lay the foundation so that commerce on the web could be trusted and there were people behind the technology who would take care of their customer &#8211; this gesture helped.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After all the dot-coms went out of business, I was a little shaken, and wondering if I really wanted to do start ups again – I had a family of four I was supporting after all.  I went to BabyCenter, which was a great set up, because they had been a startup that got acquired by Johnson &amp; Johnson. J&amp;J is really a very hands-off corporation in all the right ways. They expect you to run your business very independently and do what you need to do to make your business work. It was like being in with this great, big parent company behind you and supporting you while we took a second shot at an eCommerce business.  So, that was really where we got serious about making e-commerce work for the long run and we couldn’t pull tactics like sending ten dollar bills to your customers to take care of the mistake that you made. We focused on building a strong vendor community (they were still afraid to do business on the web), building strong and reliable customer operations, using the technology to our advantage, and getting to profitability. Are you familiar with Baby Center at all?</span></p>\n<p><b>Not at all. [laughter]</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay – BabyCenter’s secret sauce is when you come to their website for the first time they ask for the mother&#8217;s due date and that sets off a relationship with the site and the mom based on the stage of pregnancy and age of the baby. We had 8,000 articles about the health of the baby and pregnancy. We would send a weekly email about the development of the baby that got it right every single time. Moms would ask how we knew this was what was going on for her or her baby. I came on just as we were launching a new ecommerce business because their old one had gone down with the previous owner. In the store we leveraged the stage of the mom and the age of the baby with how we merchandised. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of laying the foundations of eCommerce… the previous BabyCenter store had customer comments, which we brought back &#8212; I think it was originally just them and Amazon during the dotcom era. The thing about customer comments was they were so new our vendor community was really afraid of them – the thought of customers publicly sharing their view of a product was appalling to some manufacturers – of course now it’s completely the norm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three years into my tenure at BabyCenter, I became VP of the store, and I remember going with our fabulous merchandise buyers to do a dog and pony show around the country to our top vendors with the goal of building their trust or winning over vendors who refused to sell online at all.  We had to constantly reinforce that we were a legitimate store because they were afraid of online.  They fearfully thought we would undercut pricing or ruin their brand with crazy promotions funded by tech investments. BabyCenter, though, had this editorially objective health site with a critical mass of pregnant moms that really legitimized us. J&amp;J too as a parent company legitimized us. So we got a lot of vendors, but they were still very nervous about the customer comments.  Eventually a few of the vendors started to figure out that the comments helped them design their products because they could listen to the customer to make improvements.  Our merchants were all over these types of stories when the next nervous merchant would complain so slowly the community started to understand the benefits of the wide open web.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other thing that was great about the early time in eCommerce was we were all asking each other for help. Companies like A&amp;E, HBO, Bluefly, Travelocity, NY Met Museum Store, the Smithsonian, Amazon, eBay, and anybody in the industry who was building a commerce site for the first time  would talk with each other and we&#8217;d help each other with our questions. We’d reinforce for each other what we knew was right – like helping customers by allowing customer comments  – even though our vendors threatened to pull their products.  We’d float a lot of site questions like should navs be on top or on the left, should we use tabs like Amazon, etc.   Shop.org and the Customer Experience Councils run by what is now called Collaborative Gain were big facilitators of those conversations. We all built strong networks of peers who were growing and scaling their businesses online and also growing in their careers and they&#8217;ve all become great friends over the years, which is so special to me. There is an intensity to these relationships because we were all very vulnerable and humble since the industry was so new.  </span></p>\n<p><b>So true.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To give you a sense for how small and fledgling a community we were, the first Shop.org conference I went to had about 60 people in a meeting room at the Hyatt in New York.  It was amazing to meet everyone and realize they all had the same challenges and questions and that we could literally all help each other.  The last time I attended shop.org in 2007 there was something like 7 or 8 thousand people at a big convention hotel in Las Vegas – and it still goes on. It was really great to see that community grow and it was both vendors and stores. I loved the vendor aspect of the community because there were so many new types of technologies that your store could take advantage of but that we wouldn’t want to build for ourselves – tools like analytics, search, and the shopping sites that were lead gen for your store. The conferences were all about learning and connecting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of us were very vocal and I think participatory in asking for help, which is how I got involved in the Cyber Monday conversation. The Executive Director of Shop.org got a group of us together on the phone and floated the idea of this term &#8220;Cyber Monday.&#8221; We had all been talking about promotion trends for the holidays, and we knew that Black Friday was the big promotional day for bricks and mortar, but we also all knew that the following Monday, when everybody got back to work from Thanksgiving, our online orders spiked. We wanted online to own a part of the holiday season in the mind of customers and thought we could lean into the spiking of the orders on that Monday. We all agreed Cyber Monday was a great term and then a few of us were interviewed by the Wall Street Journal and they quoted me on the front page, which was something I never expected to happen and was exciting! We continued to collaborate over the holidays because there were such consistent patterns in the shopping across all of our sites. I don&#8217;t know that this happens anymore in eCommerce, where people communicate and share the dynamics of the season that they’re experiencing, but back then, we were looking at things like the final day to ship in time for Christmas, the Cyber Monday promotions, and tactics for extending out your window of shopping as long as possible. The fourth quarter was and still is the biggest quarter for most of these sites and the stakes are high for the merchant to get the orders right for the customer – we had good years and bad ones in terms of delivery accuracy across the industry and we worked collaboratively to reflect on the bad and improve. I’m completely confident now placing orders that have to arrive by a deadline and that is the result of all of our hard work in early eCommerce.  </span></p>\n<p><b>It&#8217;s just amazing to think about E-Commerce being small enough to be a community.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah and back then, I think we were excited about it approaching 2% of retail and maybe someday like in 5 years it would get to 4% of total retail sales. Now its approaching 8 and 9% of total retail sales and mobile has taken off.</span></p>\n<p><b>For sure.</b></p>\n<p><b>What other things &#8211; when it was a small community, and you all were just experimenting with different things, and showing ideas, and sharing dynamics with each other &#8211; what other concepts did you guys see and introduce for the first time that are just omnipresent now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shipping! The catalog industry for years had made money on their shipping charges, and when e-commerce came along, we wanted to remove any barriers to buying and conversion in check out. Many of the sites just had free shipping to combat any reason a customer wouldn&#8217;t try online. Shipping and lack of trust were the biggest reasons customers gave for not buying online. We wanted to build the customer trust and help them try the BabyCenter store so had a $5.99 flat shipping fee no matter what you purchased – so a pacifier would cost $5.99, a bed the same, if you bought the two together they’d ship separately but the customer still only paid $5.99.  We and all the other sites were losing our shirts with shipping costs. We weren&#8217;t even building the loss from the shipping cost into our retail price, because customers could compare prices with other sites and we had to be competitive on price. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of talking to the online community for help, I talked with old catalogers.  If you talked to e-commerce people, they would say, &#8220;No, you absolutely can&#8217;t charge for shipping- the customers just won&#8217;t shop with you.&#8221; But the catalog industry was much more realistic. They ran the numbers very, very carefully to know how to charge and how to make money on it. The thing that the catalog business couldn&#8217;t do was have a calculator that a customer could use when doing mail order and adding up the charges themselves. Catalogs charged based on the value of the order for simple calculations. You paid the most for a high-value order. The problem was, a silk scarf might cost $450 and you have to pay the highest shipping cost even though it&#8217;s the lightest thing to ship. So the advantage that our e-commerce store had was we could build a calculator into our checkout that used the weight and footprint of the product. We shipped pregnancy pillows, which are these great big light things, but they&#8217;re actually expensive to ship because the footprint of the box is really big. We started to build in that kind of intelligence into our shipping calculators, and the idea was to charge the customer what was realistic and understandable in terms of the shipping charge.  This early move on the part of our store massively changed the bottom-line of the store and we had no customer rebellion because the charges could be explained and they made common sense. That was a really satisfying thing &#8211; We got to use the technology to its advantage, make some money for the store, give something realistic to the customer that they could understand, and the store’s P&amp;L started to make a lot more sense. </span></p>\n<p><b>It&#8217;s amazing. Did you expect at all that your experience in hospitality [laughter] and the catalog industry would be so valuable to you?</b></p>\n<p>No I don&#8217;t think I was all that calculating when I was making choices for my career with catalog and hotels (I was calculating though when I went to that first start up because tech was so important to the Bay Area’s economy it seemed a shame not to tap into as a career choice) Before that though, I was really trying to go by what was going to make me happy, be the most engaging and developmental for me.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In hindsight, the other skill that hospitality and the catalogue business gave me was great analytical skills because I was doing a lot of forecasting and managing large labor &amp; vendor costs. I knew when I got into tech I appreciated that real world experience that required us to make money and manage costs. In tech when you&#8217;re so focused on solving technical problems and proving new models to your customers or the business community it’s easy to lose sight of building good businesses that fulfill on their promise to the customer or share holder. I like that common sense business perspective that I&#8217;ve contributed to my businesses.</span></p>\n<p><b>Absolutely. Tell me more about what it was like being a woman coming into tech from a totally different industry and having two babies when you started. What is that like? Were you the only mom around at that point?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, at the startup I was the only one with kids (they were 18 months and 2.5 years old) except for the CFO who started toward the end and she had a middle schooler.  I found out long after we were done working with each other that she didn&#8217;t even know that I had babies during that time.   I think I kind of hid it there and came up with my own solutions. &#8212; Instead of working late into the night when everybody else did, I would get up at 4am to miss traffic and get to the office as early as 5 or 6am.  I’d have a few hours of quiet time where I could get a lot of work done and then be home in time for dinner and see my kids in the evening. I did have to push back on people calling for 6pm or 7pm meetings and then I do remember explaining I had small kids to get home to knowing it might hurt my influence somehow.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With one start up I interviewed with after the dot.com bubble burst, I opted out altogether because the founders had dropped out of college to start the company so they weren’t exactly at the life stage I was at with small kids. Tellingly to their late night, late morning schedules my interviews were at 8pm in the evening. I couldn’t imagine they had any idea what it was like to have babies at home so I declined the opportunity – years later they ended up making it really big and I potentially could have made millions.  I remember thinking about that at the time and looking back on all the things my kids had gone through while I would have been out of the house killing myself for that business (the kids were learning to read, do math, dance, socialization, all normal kid stuff plus my daughter also had some learning differences we managed with some specialists, which took time and commitment to her) – no way would I change that decision to opt out of the start up. The kids needed me during that time and I’m so glad I had jobs that allowed me to be home at nights and on weekends. Maybe I worked just as hard at the companies that never made a killing, maybe I was actually afraid of taking the plunge into a completely new disruptive model, but in my mind I designed a career that didn’t remove me completely from my family life.  At least with one choice the monetary result of that decision wasn’t as positive – again though it was right for me and my family.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I struggled more at home though as a woman in tech than I did at the office.  When faced with the opportunity to go to the start up I did join, my husband and I spent a lot of time evaluating if this was really what we wanted.  We had decided my career would be primary and with tech I had the opportunity to thrive in my career vs. just survive juggling a nothing special job and being a mom. Earning a living started to fall onto my shoulders and care giving for our kids fell to my husband because my jobs demanded a lot of time and ultimately a lot of travel.  We had no role models and even the other working moms that I knew tended to have a husband who was also working. Those moms were balancing their career with being the heavy lifter at home, whereas I was putting everything that I had into my career, trying to be a good mom at the same time, but with a husband who was a really strong supporter at home. Without the role models, though, it was really hard for both of us to keep a balance in those roles, and I think ultimately, what happened to us was we kind of lost ourselves. I like to say “I leaned in so hard I fell over” ha ha.  For a variety of reasons, our marriage failed, but we would both say that we managed to raise two really great kids who have had the benefit of growing up with an involved working mom and a really involved dad. Ultimately, I wanted a bigger role with my kids, which I got as a single mom after the divorce and sharing custody.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another unique aspect of my career, which was also true the years I’ve been in Tech, was that for whatever reason, I was in companies that had strong female leaders.  At BabyCenter, where I became part of the exec team for the first time, we had a female CEO and we had a majority of female exec&#8217;s.  Hotwire too had a majority women on our Exec team and Mulberry Neckwear had a female founder again with majority female leaders in senior leadership.  It really wasn’t until I was 35 that I noticed, or even realized how being a woman brought a different style to a team. It wasn&#8217;t until I was on an exec team that had a majority of men that I started to wake up to, &#8220;Oh, there are big differences between men and women and how they lead and manage people.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think the turning point for me was when I had a boss who was the CEO tell me that one of my female managers, who happened to be our best product person in the company, was too emotional.  He wanted me to work on that with her.  The conversation obviously raised some flags for me, and I wasn’t quite sure if it was ok or not. I walked away thinking, I don&#8217;t know what that means so I talked to a friend of mine, who is an amazing gender discrimination lawyer. I confided with her that I thought I needed to learn more about gender issues in the workplace.  As much as I had grown up with a feminist mother and maybe because she was a single mom, I didn&#8217;t know what sexism looked like and it had never felt like a factor in my work – my experience was if you deliver you’ll get recognized. My friend’s advice was to read &#8216;Men Are From Mars, Women are from Venus&#8217; so I could understand gender differences a little better.  It opened up this whole new world for me because I was raised with my sister by a single mother and didn&#8217;t have strong male role models in our house. I had no idea what men were sensitive about and even that they are sensitive! I thought all men were strong and made of Teflon.   To apply the book’s content in the workplace was really eye opening and I hope my work on my own lack of sensitivity to men’s orientation served to bring me closer to the men I work with.  I never did address the quote emotional issue with my employee and instead continued to support her with her results, which she definitely was recognized for. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Silicon Valley is talking a lot these days about the obvious sexism when it occurs. What strikes me is that the men aren’t present in these dialogues after the fact.  Almost every company I join now has a women’s group or a women’s summit that works to develop us or support us. These groups are great – women mentor each other and focus on creating great results for their businesses. Consistently, though, the men aren&#8217;t present. What I would find really interesting is what the men think and experience. How do we learn that the conversation is just different when it involves women and men – it’s not about men changing or women changing, but instead about a dynamic that is completely different when we&#8217;re all equals at the table. We all have to realize it’s going to be uncomfortable and we’ll feel unease, but the benefit is huge because the diversity of styles and ideas will create better ideas and solutions. I’m not sure women and men are talking together about the fact that we need to do the hard work and feel that discomfort in order to move forward in creating diversity in the industry. It’s not comfortable when the people on your team don’t all look and act alike – the industry hasn’t figured out that the benefit of that discomfort is great results.</span></p>\n<p><b>Let&#8217;s keep going with that. In your time in tech &#8211; you&#8217;ve been in 17 years, whether it&#8217;s related to being female, whether it&#8217;s related to something not having much to do with you &#8211; how have you seen tech change through these multiple cycles? How has it changed and how is it the same, for better or for worse?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was going to say it seems like it&#8217;s getting younger!  That is just because I’ve aged though – we were young during the dotcom times ha ha.</span></p>\n<p><b>For sure.</b></p>\n<p><b><br />\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I certainly feel like I have a very strong set of peers who are the same age as me and we are all actively engaged with each other and involved in the tech community.  I’m not sure the tech world has learned that diversity of all types (including age) helps results though because you still find us in packs that all look alike.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think one clear change is that the female/male conversation is getting really loud. That was not present for me at all in the beginning or I was unaware of it if it was. I&#8217;m amazed at how loud the conversation is getting with the tweets, anecdotes, books, and media attention it’s getting. I still feel like it&#8217;s a lot of talk and there&#8217;s not a lot of actions going on that are truly changing the statistics of women in leadership roles at C-levels or on boards. </span></p>\n<p>Another interesting change over time is that lot of the small companies have gotten extremely large, and they look like the large companies that we were all running from when we went to work for small companies. It&#8217;s amazing to me how these small companies start out so   nimble, and flexible, and then very consistently grow into pretty big operations with their own fair share of bureaucracy.</p>\n<p>Maybe the tech world has more awareness of diversity and is more diverse as a result of these large sizes. The big companies I’ve worked for seemed more supportive of diversity efforts than the small ones I work with.  When you’re small it seems you surround yourself with people that look like you or act like you, but in the big companies, all types of people exist. I see them represented with groups. There&#8217;s LGBT groups, there&#8217;s minority groups, there&#8217;s any group that really wants to form, and the company is supportive of it. So versus the rest of the world, I see the big companies making an effort to embrace the diverse communities that they have within them. But again, it is at the lower levels of the company and when you get into the executive branch it&#8217;s very homogenous still. Which is where I think the work is to be done.</p>\n<p><b>You mentioned in your pre-interview that your kids don&#8217;t find tech very desirable after seeing the experiences you&#8217;ve been through. Can you expand on that?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think for them&#8211; they live with me and they know my highs and lows, and —they see you have to be pretty resilient in tech. They’ve seen my jobs come and go and the companies come and go. So some of that is just their personal experience with their mom, I think. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m really thankful for the opportunities because they’ve allowed me to provide a lot for my kids. They have a great start in life, but they&#8217;ve also gone to schools with people that have massive amounts of money as a result of tech. I think they&#8217;re very sensitive to the privilege that they&#8217;ve grown up with, and they have this suspicion that the tech community isn&#8217;t aware of its own privilege.. So they&#8217;re going into very creative careers, most likely in the arts or somehow connected to the arts. Right or wrong, and they haven&#8217;t experienced it with all the color that I have, they think about it in terms of sitting in a cubicle all day, commuting out of the city on one of the buses, and working for a big company vs. a start up. My daughter is a studio art major, and I always say, &#8220;Go into web design. It&#8217;s   the most competitive job in the valley right now.”and she&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah, yeah, whatever. I don&#8217;t want to sit in a cubicle.&#8221; They&#8217;re still young. I think there&#8217;s a chance they’ll end up connected to the industry, but they think a lot about privilege, and how that privilege creates distance with different communities in our country, and they&#8217;re sensitive to that.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Yeah, that makes sense. Kind of bouncing off of that, I&#8217;m thinking about risk.  Things turned out really well for you, and I&#8217;m curious to know if you got bit by a bug that prevented you from feeling risk or if your risk aversion was high from childhood?  I’m just curious leaving established industries and going into tech or a start up it&#8217;s super risky. I&#8217;m curious, as a mom, what was your relationship with risk or did you just know you would make it work, no matter what?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like I&#8217;m really risk averse [chuckles]. Ironically, I was always looking for security and stability and work/family balance, but I think I knew that tech with its risks had a better chance of a high growth career than others.  Deep down I must have always known that I’m smart and can figure out jobs and I have a very strong network of people that trust me and that I trust &#8211; That I think is the insurance policy to the risks that I might take. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I learned with that first start-up, that feeling scared and nervous and like I may have made a mistake is the exact moment that you&#8217;re probably going to make a really big difference or learn something completely new. When I was working on a project that could either go really well or dramatically badly, and we tried to mitigate risks as best we could, there was always a point where we had to go with our best judgment. Those were the times that I was really nervous and afraid, but I learned it was because those were the projects that made the biggest difference for the businesses that I was in vs. ones that were tweaks and forgettable. Now I&#8217;m sort of at the point where if I’m not feeling that nervousness and being slightly scared I start to question if this is really where I should be focusing my efforts. If you&#8217;re just in a routine day in and day out you&#8217;re probably not making a big impact, which isn’t very fulfilling so you have to take risks.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. What are your goals for this year? What are you working on right now, either for your career or for yourself?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, my son is about to graduate from high school, so after this I&#8217;m an empty nester.</span></p>\n<p><b>Wow. That&#8217;s exciting. Scary.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My goal this year is giving and contribution – I want to give more to my friendships and contribute in meaningful ways to their lives, I want to make strong and meaningful contributions to the company I work for. I&#8217;m not working currently and am in a job search, but I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s highly active yet because I&#8217;m trying to assess what I want the next stage of my career to be. I&#8217;m doing a lot of reflection and the foundation work to set myself up for being an empty nester who is having a lot of fun and is fulfilled from my contributions. I hope it means a lot of fun with my career and  a lot of fun with my personal life. </span></p>\n<p><b>Amazing. Based on the reflection that you&#8217;ve done so far, what is important to you in a job now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think a strong sense of customer advocacy. A business that focuses on their customer experience so that their product is really great. The last two years I&#8217;ve been commuting to Cincinnati, helping a company in the midwest transform and become more technology-focused. I&#8217;m back in Silicon Valley now. It&#8217;s so interesting to see the, I guess, acceptance of experimentation and building for the long term that Silicon Valley has. I&#8217;m invigorated to go to a company that&#8217;s highly experimental and excited to test new directions. And then, maybe on the side or as an educational project for myself, I really want to learn about or start developing some programs to help companies get more diversity up in the executive levels because I think what we&#8217;re doing now isn&#8217;t quite enough. It’s not just about developing the women. I&#8217;d like to do some projects exploring what the men &amp; women think of these conversations about the elephant in the room, what they&#8217;re aware of or not aware of, helping to bring awareness to everyone about what equality looks like. That’s another direction that I&#8217;m interested in going likely more as an interest than an actual job.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. Just, based on your experiences or experiences of your friends, what are the biggest gaping issues that you&#8217;d like to address sooner than later?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is really easy:  unconscious bias amongst men and women.  Women and men are different – the differences add up to strengths that lead to better results when working as a team.  We’ve got to learn to embrace these differences rather than judge them. Men are very focused on results &#8211; which is good and we need that &#8211; and women are focused on broad contexts. They look at the full picture to understand all the dynamics that might be creating the results or preventing results from happening. And it&#8217;s a little bit of a slower process than just zeroing in on, &#8220;What are the results,&#8221; and &#8220;What did we do right,&#8221; or &#8220;What did we do wrong?&#8221; So you can see this spectrum where men operate at one end and women at another (I’m totally generalizing here).  Business leaders don&#8217;t know what operating in between those two ends looks like. I hope we can somehow start to identify what a gender neutral approach is or engage together and learn that neither way is wrong, so we accept both. This kind of operating amongst senior leaders does require going slow, it does require having very open and honest and messy conversations with people &#8211; some who might by nature not be very open and certainly not open to messy- I don&#8217;t think you can approach it with an agile methodology or something that can be easily blue-printed or replicated. As companies start to succeed in the area of diversity and equality we need to learn from them.  We need to hear about what exec team conversations look like when it is a truly diverse group, or what it looked like when they stumbled, and the things that the men struggled with, or that the women struggled with. This requires a ton of transparency.  The more those conversations can happen in a setting where both men and women are present, the better. It&#8217;s hard to get the men present for those right now and I’m not sure that we even ask vs. jumping in with a “women’s summit”</span></p>\n<p><b>What advice would you have, based on your experiences in tech&#8211; what advice would you have for those folk just starting out? Like what do you wish you had known in the beginning?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What advice would I have? I think this can apply to most careers, I would advise to get experience managing people and working with customers early if they can. So much happens based on people&#8217;s ability to work with people. Learn analytics and business models, because that positions you for decision making roles. Move around in companies. Don&#8217;t go for a career where you stay in one place for 20 years, because the moving around of companies serves to build a pretty diverse skill set. Even move in industries if you can, or at least verticals within tech. It gives you a really strong foundation of diverse skills. The MBA may not be so important.  Stay close to yourself and design a life that allows you to be true to yourself inside and outside of work.</span></p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>How do you think that your background and your life experience, and having people with different life experiences, informs your work?</b></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because I am a member of two very distinct ethnic groups, both African-American and Caucasian, I&#8217;ve grown up being extra sensitive to my cultural surroundings. I’ve had distinct visibility into the nuances or ‘codes&#8217; of these groups and therefore developed a heightened degree of sensitivity. I believe this has helped me adapt to my environment, but it is also a big part of my skill-set as a communicator. What I&#8217;m crafting in language and visual communication is influenced by the sensibilities that I developed as a survival mechanism.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At times I really struggled with this, in my teens, in high school, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had moments where I thought &#8220;I am not Black enough, I&#8217;ve got to figure this out.” Or “I&#8217;ve got to be more Caucasian.&#8221; It&#8217;s a very strange thing and I don&#8217;t know exactly when I became more comfortable, but in my adult years I&#8217;ve settled into the idea that I&#8217;m a very distinct human being and I will never fit neatly into these categories. I think that&#8217;s part of being mixed-race, and as individual members of this group. We&#8217;re all so different.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Empathy is also a value that I’ve embraced as a result of my background, an additional outcome of straddling two worlds for most of my life. It has heightened my awareness and sensitivity for others, their distinct journeys and experiences, and it&#8217;s a big part of my emotional make-up.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are some of your really exciting and proud moments of your career, and what have been some of the struggles?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gosh, I totally get the question. I just don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s how I’ve thought about my journey, in terms of proud moments. We all take steps in what we believe to be the right direction, and that&#8217;s my own challenge to myself — to stay mindful of the journey while working away at each individual step. These past three years is just about the longest I&#8217;ve ever been at a single company, which I think is a great time for me in terms of the work and the challenges ahead.</span></p>\n<p><b>Have there been any major roadblocks or things that you&#8217;ve had overcome in your career?</b></p>\n<p>Finding a really strong, good, creative fit is the ultimate challenge for us as makers, as communicators. We&#8217;ve all had gigs or jobs where we feel like crazy people, or when our best work is received really poorly, and that too is a crazy making experience. It took me a while to figure out that it wasn&#8217;t necessarily me, but it was the fit. So that has been a constant pursuit of mine, finding creative problems where my creativity offers the right kind of solutions. This is never a static pursuit, it&#8217;s a constantly moving relationship and dynamic. Brands, companies grow and evolve as do jobs as do collaborators. A really beautiful creative fit can be wonderful today, and might not be the case tomorrow. But that&#8217;s the dance.</p>\n<p><b>Have you had mentors or people that you&#8217;ve looked up to for inspiration along the way? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have, and they&#8217;re wonderful and are still guiding lights, both academic and professional. When I first landed in advertising back in the year 2000, I realized quickly it wasn&#8217;t a good fit for me but I was able to identify people around me whose work I thought was really interesting. So my ploy was to pull them into conference rooms, and feign a really dramatic reason, and then be like okay, I&#8217;ve got to ask “How did you get to where you are? What was your journey?” or “Tell me about where you&#8217;re heading?” That&#8217;s still something I still do today. There is so much to learn about the world and how to navigate it by better understanding the stories of people who you admire. </span></p>\n<p><b>So what is your trajectory, where are you going, what are your biggest motivators?  </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I constantly work on stoking my fire and creativity, to find new ways to be in touch with that side of my brain. Things like seeing theater, visiting galleries, looking at and appreciating fresh expressions of creativity are all exciting. I also know that I want to make a difference, even if in small ways — I want to contribute to the world, I want to contribute to our ongoing cultural dialogue. These are things that motivate me. This is not necessarily about scale, but specifically about furthering the way we think about the world and the things we expect of the world. So these are things that intrigue me and drive me.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you find your support networks?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My wife, my family, my friends. I&#8217;ve got a good crew of friends who are there for me and for us and that&#8217;s incredibly helpful. And in my wife, she is really — she&#8217;s is so solid and such a good person, she is there for me and I for her.</span></p>\n<p><b>You mentioned earlier the idea of authenticity in corporate America and I would love to hear more of your thoughts on that.</b></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve found that authenticity isn’t always welcome in corporate America, or it’s just paid lip service, but actually it’s one of our biggest virtues as individuals. In my current role, I’m encouraged to bring my authentic self to work each day which is an incredibly empowering notion. I&#8217;ve worked for companies where that&#8217;s not the case and it’s clearly best when people can be themselves, and even better when that authenticity is celebrated.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think for decades, if not generations, and it probably comes from as early as the industrial era, authenticity was not a virtue, in fact is was a burden and it slowed down the industrial process. I think that we as a society are figuring out that if you can be you, authentically, all day, even when you&#8217;re working, we&#8217;re all the better for it. And it&#8217;s a real luxury at this point I would argue. So I feel very grateful that this company embraces that value.</span></p>\n<p><b>What advice would you give to folks who either come from similar backgrounds to you or have faced similar struggles, who are in tech or hoping to get into it?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s interesting, I didn&#8217;t come into the field by pursuing tech, it kind of happened. But, my passion is design and crafting visual communication. Communicating complex notions and structures in a very distilled and succinct way. It&#8217;s so cliché, but finding your passion is really empowering, and that starts with identifying what you enjoy. I think if you stitch together the things you enjoy, this typically paints a particular vision that is different for everyone. Maybe that means tech, maybe it means design, but for me my formula has been the things that I enjoy doing come more easily and I can do them at length without limit. It&#8217;s how I’m able to work tirelessly at what I’m doing because I&#8217;m enjoying the process, it&#8217;s a genuine kind of pleasure. That for me has been the key. So if I had advice it would be to start with what you enjoy.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Why don&#8217;t we start at the beginning? Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I grew up in Modesto, that’s where my parents raised me and my younger brother. They&#8217;re still there and I grew up with a fairly normal life. Well, I guess normal for me. My dad&#8217;s black and my mom is Pacific Islander. So I had big family gatherings, my mom comes from a family of 15. So just tons of family.</span></p>\n<p class=\"body_text\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At some point when I was a kid, I remember my dad telling me &#8220;Whatever you do just make sure that you—one, do what you love and then two, make sure you know how to use a computer.&#8221;</span></i> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[chuckles] So when I was a kid, he&#8217;d buy me little books on computer hardware, so I always had a little bit of curiosity towards computers and also towards making things. I was also really big into Legos, I would just build stuff all day. He also bought me a little old record player from a garage sale just so I could tear it apart and take parts out of it… just mess around. So, I always grew up tinkering with things.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then, right around the end of high school, I got into Macromedia Flash. I downloaded a cracked version of it and that really piqued my interest. I thought it was just really cool that I could create something and have it animate across the screen if you interacted with it. From there, I learned how to use Photoshop because I wanted to make my own assets. Then I wanted to show my friends and put it up on the web, so I learned how to write HTML and work with FTP. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then when I got into college, I figured I might as well try design as a major because I was undeclared at the time. I was doing a music minor, because I loved my guitar too. So I just started learning more in school and picking up side projects. Then got my first job in the industry when I was 20. I was going to school at the same time too. At this point, I had moved over here to San Francisco. I went to SF State for a couple of years. Then I moved down to LA to finish up school. That&#8217;s when I got my first job in the industry as a graphic designer at a little agency. From there I started working a lot. I started getting introduced to new types of design too. I worked with a guy named Morgan Knutson, who is an incredible designer.</span></p>\n<p><b>I know Morgan! Great guy.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nice! Yeah, you probably know Morgan. I worked with him back in the day. He&#8217;s always been a really great guy. He got me into CSS and thinking more about the product side of design. I basically left that job to work as a web/product designer at a small streaming company. I cut my teeth on making software, making little products for the company. I eventually left there because it wasn&#8217;t really a product company, it was more of a streaming-service company.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there I moved to a company called Hudl, which is a sports video company, and that was really fun because they are really a product-focused company and they also build for sports, which is fun. I loved sports in high school when I was growing up. I worked with them for about a year and a half. I was remote out in L.A., and the company is in Nebraska. I learned so much there, but started feeling like I needed to get back into an HQ-setting. I think that was going to be really important for me over the long-term, over the next 10-20 years, just being back with people and getting high-touch interactions and quick feedback loops. Right around that time a few companies up here were starting to reach out and at the end of the day, I made the move over to Dropbox.</span></p>\n<p><b>Nice.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. I’m getting the lay of the land and talking to a lot of people and starting to sink my teeth into some projects. I&#8217;m excited about the company, excited about where things are going.</span></p>\n<p><b>So did you and your wife *just* move here then?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, just two weeks ago.</span></p>\n<p><b>Oh my god. This is exciting. Fresh perspective. [laughter]</b></p>\n<p class=\"body_text\">I know. I&#8217;m trying to—with this move and with things at Dropbox—keep my fresh eyes on as long as I can. I know how it goes. You get into something a few months in and you start going blind to the little cracks and details. I&#8217;m trying to keep my fresh eyes as long as I can.</p>\n<p><b>Tell me about your first impressions of Silicon Valley. I&#8217;m assuming you had impressions before you were in it—did it live up to any of them? Were you surprised about certain things? What did you expect and what did you find out?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m not a native of Silicon Valley and San Francisco but I had come to the city ever since I was a kid and I lived here in college. So I was pretty familiar with the lay of the land, the people, the whole San Francisco vibe, versus every other city in the world. Having been away from it for ten years, obviously a lot has changed and I knew that going in. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I knew that there was always an economic gap here in the city, even before the tech boom, but I think this latest boom has made it more apparent. </span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other difference I see is that a city that has historically been so diverse, is looking less and less diverse these days. A lot of the companies that I&#8217;ve been at, I&#8217;m the only person of color in the entire company or at least the technical team.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Looking at a larger company like Dropbox, there&#8217;s maybe only a couple handfuls of people that I might see that look like me. Seeing it at that big of a scale, opens your eyes a little bit more.</span></p>\n<p><b>I definitely want to dig in more on all of this. First tell me, what are some of the most exciting parts to you about working in tech over the years? What things about your work have really activated you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For me, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the most exciting thing about tech is that it&#8217;s a constant march forward. Tech is just so future-facing, almost to a fault. There&#8217;s this constant retooling and re-educating that all of us in tech do. For me as a maker and a learner, it&#8217;s exciting because that&#8217;s how I’m naturally built. If I wasn&#8217;t in tech, I would still constantly be trying to learn new things.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> That’s fun.</span></p>\n<p><b>What have been some of your biggest struggles and roadblocks during the course of your career?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;d say one that I had was lack of a community, I always felt a little siloed. The university that I went to didn’t have anything for web, it was all print and advertising focused. Finding people that were interested in web/software/design was really hard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I guess early on that was a struggle for me, just trying to find that community. That&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve been proactive about in the last few years, and it&#8217;s an area where I think the industry is starting to evolve and mature a little bit more. There&#8217;s just more people, so that helps, too. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another struggle is that I&#8217;m a maker by trade. I have loved designing but it&#8217;s hard to scale your influence that way. I like to have more of a handle on the products that I&#8217;m working on, and the companies that I&#8217;m working on. So, I have to force myself out of making and designing a little bit, and try to access more of the people mentor in me. I’m being more intentional about making that transition and bridging that gap. I have to fight some of my natural tendencies to get there.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. So I would say you&#8217;re local, pretty darn local compared to most people here.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, yeah.</span></p>\n<p class=\"body_text\"><b>Tell me more about what it&#8217;s like straddling those two worlds, it&#8217;s like being part of tech, and also growing up near here.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To me it&#8217;s like a double-edged sword because it is an industry that I love but I understand it&#8217;s an industry that can push out anybody that&#8217;s not in it.</span> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was just walking home from work today and I overheard two designers talking about how they can&#8217;t afford to live in the city and these are people that actually work in this industry. How much harder is it for a firefighter or an elementary school teacher?</span></i> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ten years from now does SF become a city of investors and bankers and that&#8217;s it? At some point things have to break. That&#8217;s just the way history goes. </span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. What has your experience been like as a man of color in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oddly enough, I’d say my experience in tech has been similar to most people. I’ve never felt like I didn’t get a job or project because of my ethnicity, but I know that’s not the case for everyone though. I&#8217;ve always run into these great people in tech, but when you look at the numbers, you can definitely see there&#8217;s something that needs to happen here.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I actually think about it most when I’m not at the office. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is this gold rush that is happening in tech and if people of color (or just other backgrounds that aren&#8217;t white and male) aren&#8217;t tooling themselves up, we can run the risk of creating a permanent underclass. So that&#8217;s something that I think about.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I have to be aware and try to not just do my own thing, but also have to try and give back as much as I can. </span></p>\n<p><b>For sure. What are your biggest motivators? What drives you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My family… my wife, Jennifer. We don&#8217;t have any kids yet, but just being her husband, it definitely brought a greater sense of responsibility, and affects how I make decisions. I think a lot longer and plan a little bit more in decades now. Having that long vision really fuels me into pushing hard right now. Whether it&#8217;s pushing hard to just create better work or to invest more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another motivator is just this little ethos that I have which is: “To become better so that I can help others become better.” Becoming a better designer, a better leader, a better communicator, whatever it is. I want to level up myself in all of those areas. Not just for my own personal benefit but also to help others level up in those areas as well. That&#8217;s always on my mind as I&#8217;m reading or getting feedback or talking to people one-on-one. </span></p>\n<p><b>What do you look for in a job now? What is¥ a priority to you in a job versus when you started?</b></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I started it was pretty simple: &#8220;Can I make enough money and can I do some cool stuff?&#8221; These days it&#8217;s more about &#8220;How much impact can I have—not just inside the company but outside the company?&#8221;</span></i> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And also &#8220;What are the quality of the people that I&#8217;m working with?&#8221; </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You always want to be working with people that are way smarter than you. You don&#8217;t want to be the smartest person in the room. I want to come to work not only to produce, but also to learn as well.</span></i> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s one thing that I definitely look for. Also the company needs to have strong values and opinions. The worst thing would be for a company to be middle of the road and hemming and hawing on issues. That&#8217;s something that is increasingly important to me.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do your friends and family feel about how far you&#8217;ve come?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;d say they&#8217;re very proud, especially my parents. I&#8217;ve got a really good relationship with my parents. They are big fans and users of Dropbox. So when they heard I was coming over here, they said, &#8220;Oh yeah, we use Dropbox! We love it!&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was probably nine or ten, I remember my dad and I were watching a documentary on the Selma marches. After it was done, my dad turned the TV off and he said, &#8220;When you grow up, you have to make something of yourself. Not just for me or just for yourself, but for all of them that sacrificed for you to actually be able to work wherever you want, and drink from whatever water fountain you want.&#8221; So, that&#8217;s been a responsibility that I&#8217;ve always tried to put on myself.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also,</span> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was named after my grandfather and I&#8217;ve always thought about these things in generations. How he came out of the segregated south with little education and no money and got his family out of there. Then my dad was one of the first to get a degree. Now I&#8217;m trying to build on their foundation.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>How do you think the culmination of your background and all of your life experiences impact the way that you approach your work?</b></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My experience growing up has made me a very adaptable person. I can pretty quickly adapt to a situation or different personality types. That&#8217;s pretty common of biracial kids and growing up in different neighborhoods. That has carried over to the workplace and my career as well, because I&#8217;ve been able to work well with a lot of different types of people and a lot of different types of personalities, on a lot of different types of projects. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s one of the things that has helped me  from my past.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? What&#8217;s really exciting to you, what&#8217;s frustrating to you? What would you like to see change?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good question. I&#8217;m bullish on tech in 2016. Is it okay if I talk about it from a little more of a designer?</span></p>\n<p><b>Totally, however you view it. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing that I&#8217;m excited about for design in tech is that I see more designers and companies that just aren&#8217;t chasing consumer tech, they&#8217;re trying to apply design thinking to a larger or more important problem. For example, I&#8217;m seeing a lot of medical startups and startups that are working to help bring communities together to petition their local lawmakers, things like that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are more and more designers thinking about those problems that are maybe a little less attractive, and might not make the front page of Designer News, but they&#8217;re very important problems that need design thinking. That&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m really looking forward to seeing where and how it  takes off. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s frustrating about tech right now? It&#8217;s very self-referential, especially when you&#8217;re here in the valley. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of people assume that others in the world have two and three iPhones and an iPad, and a stable internet connection, and food on their plates and a roof over their head. When we surround ourselves with only people like that, we’ll naturally tend to try and solve first-world problems, right?</span></i> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, obviously those of us in tech are a very small sub-section of humanity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we start to shine the light on real people, and actually fill our Twitter feeds and news feeds with real life (not just tech life) it&#8217;ll make us a more rounded and better people, and that will in turn, produce more rounded and better products.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are you working on right now in 2016? Either for work or for yourself, like, what are your goals this year?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A big thing I&#8217;m working on is being still and quiet. At my last company and even before that, I was pushing pretty hard and when I got the job here at Dropbox, I had a few weeks of downtime in between. I took that time and did some hikes. I realized that I need to recharge the batteries a lot more and be still a lot more. I&#8217;m a social introvert. I like being around people, but at the end of the day, being alone recharges me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve got some goals around prayer and meditation time this year. Backpacking trips, fishing trips. I think it&#8217;s a great counterweight to tech and it&#8217;s probably why so many people in tech are into the outdoors, because it&#8217;s just nice to be off the grid and back in the dirt [chuckles]. There&#8217;s something really primal about it. It’s just satisfying.</span></p>\n<p><b>Cool. A little further ahead, where do you see yourself in five or ten years?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I plan to still be here in the Bay and will likely still be involved in tech. Probably not as a designer but in some other capacity. It’s tough to plan with too much detail with that long of a time horizon so you just have to stick to your principles and commit to growing yourself and those around you. It’s less about using a map and more about using a compass.</span></p>\n<p><b>My last question for you would be, what advice would you have for folks who have similar backgrounds to you who are hoping to get into tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One piece of advice that I find myself giving more often to people starting out is this: continue to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">focus on being a great executor but don&#8217;t let that part of yourself discount the importance of being a really good person to work with. Be a good professional. Listen with the intent of understanding. Be proactive and intentional about helping others. These are skills that multiply any work that you do; whether it&#8217;s in engineering or product or design. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How we work with each other is the highest point on the pyramid. It’s also so rewarding because creating great products and services is one thing, but working with people, to me, is some of the most satisfying work that you can do in your life. Seeing someone else succeed; being able to give someone a break; connecting two people that wouldn&#8217;t have connected if it wasn&#8217;t for you; being a defender of a co-worker in a meeting; these are some of the most fulfilling things that I think you could do.</span></p>\n<p class=\"body_text\">",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Tell me about your early years, and where you come from. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I grew up in Connecticut, in West Hartford. I hate to use the term tomboy because that&#8217;s really come out of vogue these days—but I was kind of a rough and tumble little girl. I was really into being outside, and doing imagination stuff, and running around with the boys on my streets, and that kind of translated well into&#8230;male-dominated industry is my whole life.  </span></p>\n<p><b>Did you have any inclinations as a kid that your would end up in something techy?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I didn&#8217;t. My main goal was to go to college, and I only applied to one: Emerson. And to get a job working in the audio field. It was technical, but it was really more related around the audio industry and live sound. And it wasn&#8217;t till I moved out to San Francisco, kind of on a lark, that I realized I could combine my love of technology, which I liked as a fan, and my love of audio, to kind of build this strange career that I&#8217;ve made. </span></p>\n<p><b>Walk me through the path from production to hosting to be a well-known nerd world media figure.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went to school for audio and radio production, but I was really a tech; I loved computers. I loved everything about the early internet. I&#8217;ve been on the internet since the CompuServe/Prodigy days, but I never really thought of it as something I could do for a job. We had computer classes at school, but it wasn&#8217;t that time yet where people were really like, &#8221;Oh, yeah. You should be a programmer. You should be a developer. Like this is something that you could do.&#8221; It was like, &#8221;We&#8217;re going to build stuff in CAD or we&#8217;re going to take typing classes.&#8221; So it was a very different kind of atmosphere back then.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I got to San Francisco—I moved out here with two girlfriends, and we shared a tiny apartment and I lived in the living room, and slept on a mattress on the floor like everyone does at some point in their life. And I was constantly searching Craigslist for job postings. One day, I found one for an internship at CNET. At the time, I was temping, so I was taking any work I could get. It was a very low-paying internship at the time, definitely not something I could have lived off of. But it was that opening door, that opportunity to get in on the ground floor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I put my resume in, got the callback, and went in for an interview. I showed them I could edit audio and work production, and got the gig. At first, it was very boring stuff. It was like white papers and audio from board meetings and things like that. I was much more interested in the consumer tech side of things. They eventually needed someone to produce and edit one of their early podcasts, Buzz Out Loud (a daily tech news show hosted by Molly Wood and Tom Merritt), and I just fell in love with it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I jumped on the chance and found after couple of weeks that I had a really hard time keeping my mouth shut when they would start getting into conversations about the news of the day in the tech world. So I started talking, and I eventually became the third co-host. Eventually, my boss was like, &#8221;Hey, you should really give this video thing a go. We&#8217;re relaunching CNET TV. We need more hosts. I know you know how to video edit and produce so just jump in there. Write a script for yourself, get on camera, see how it feels, see if you like it.&#8221; And I did.</span></p>\n<p><b>What shows were most rewarding for you over the course of your career?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tekzilla on Revision3 (now Discovery Digital), was really fun for me. I did that show for about five years, and we covered everything from viewer tech support to product reviews to big segments on internet privacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I think my favorite show for Revision3 was Fact or Fictional. It was a look at the technology and science in media. Comic books, video games, TV, film—how accurate were they? I would bring on guests like scientists, engineers, and thought leaders to give me the rundown on what was possible and what was just totally make believe. That&#8217;s always been my M.O.: combining information with entertainment and making it palatable and fun.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are the most captivating things about your work? What aspects of the work just totally drive you and excite you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fan interactions or viewer and listener interactions. The Sword and Laser, the sci-fi fantasy podcast that I&#8217;ve been doing for the last eight years, has fans that have been listening since day one and they still contribute, and they still talk at the forums, and they still call in. I just love it. It feels like a family. It feels like a deeply nerdy family [laughter]. </span></p>\n<p><b>What have been some of the toughest parts and the biggest struggles? Particularly as a woman in tech media?</b></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been tough occasionally, and you definitely get a lot more flack, I think, for being a woman. But there are so many women in the space now that it&#8217;s hard to write them off as anomalies anymore. For me personally, my biggest issue has just been dealing with rejection, because I have tried to do so many projects. Things for TV, or things for other channels and networks, and it&#8217;s so hard to put all your passion and energy into a project just to have it brought down by some nameless faceless person on a network somewhere, sitting in a room deciding what&#8217;s going to be on TV for the next year. That&#8217;s tough and it&#8217;s something that I don&#8217;t think you ever really get used to. Each time just feels like a slap in the face.</p>\n<p><b>There is a considerable amount of the population of the internet that seems to be kind of obsessed with you at times, and I&#8217;m curious how you handle that.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think it&#8217;s about boundaries. I&#8217;ve built up certain walls of protection around myself, and if something gets too out of hand, if some fan, or listener, or viewer, gets a little too familiar, you just have to shut that down. It&#8217;s hard, because when we talk to people online we feel like we know them. Especially if you listen to a podcast or watch a video regularly, that person, me, I&#8217;m in your ear talking to you on a very personal level every week. So people feel like they know me. But you can&#8217;t always be an open book I think, and there are some boundaries you have to mentally set about what you share about your personal life.</span></p>\n<p><b>You work in some of the nerdiest part of the internet where there&#8217;s been some aggression lately. Do you catch the brunt of any of that aggression or has it been largely positive for you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For better or for worse, I try to stay out of it. The few times that I have jumped into the fray have been, well—the amount of shit you get is so disproportionate to the comments that you make that it doesn&#8217;t ever feel worth it. I stood up for my friend one time on Twitter and I just woke up the next morning to a wall  of responses from GamerGate people. I was just like, &#8220;You know, I&#8217;ve got work to do. I&#8217;ve got a life.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you find your support networks? Where did you find them in the beginning and where do you find them now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think the biggest support is probably my husband, Ryan, because he gets me. In this weird industry, it&#8217;s hard to find a lot of people that can relate to the lifestyle, especially when you&#8217;re a freelancer, and especially when you&#8217;re working on the internet, and especially when it&#8217;s a medium like audio or video. It&#8217;s a very weird experience and he encouraged me to do it. That was when we first started dating. He was like, &#8220;Go for it. You&#8217;re good at this. You should try it.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But also other women who work in the same space, we all comment about everything, from weirdos on the internet, to not getting a gig, to not getting people to pay us in a timely manner. It&#8217;s been nice to have a community of like-minded women that I can share those experiences with.</span></p>\n<p><b>How have you seen tech change culturally over the years or have it?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We&#8217;re kind of in this weird place right now where we&#8217;re moving away again from blogs. When I started my career, the big threats to CNET were Engadget and Gizmodo, and sites like that that were able to turn out content at an incredible rate and just really stay on top of things in a way that the old media sites weren&#8217;t really able to compete with until much later. And now it seems to be less about blogs and more about curated content and stuff that we&#8217;re receiving through social, whether it be through Facebook or Twitter. Now, everybody&#8217;s trying to figure out how to reach the most people and get the most clicks to make things viral. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course now, we&#8217;ve got a huge industry around on-demand products. You know, rides when you want them, food when you want it, groceries when you want them. That whole industry has really shaken everything up in a pretty incredible way. The technology is changing so fast and moving in such an incredible rate that now we&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay. When&#8217;s the backlash coming? When&#8217;s the next backlash coming because it&#8217;s going to happen.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><b>If tech media were this way today, would you want to be in it? Would you feel encouraged or discouraged?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Totally discouraged. From my particular career, I would be intimidated by the YouTubers, and the Vine stars [laughter], and the people who are just building and amassing these beautiful audiences through different channels. That didn&#8217;t exist back then. I think I would still probably want to be in technology, and that&#8217;s kind of where I&#8217;m going with my next career shift. Lately I&#8217;ve been thinking about getting out of the video space and getting into more of an operational role at a company. That&#8217;s really exciting, but yeah, it kind of feels like I&#8217;m starting over at 33 [chuckles]. </span></p>\n<p><b>What do you look for in a job now versus when you started?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I actually just wrote a big post about the freelance lifestyle on Medium, that&#8217;s got a lot of traction because I&#8217;ve been a freelancer now for the past eight years. But there&#8217;s always the feast-or-famine scenario; there&#8217;s going to be highs and lows. Planning for that can be especially difficult in my type of work where you&#8217;re essentially waiting for people to need you. They have to come to you. It&#8217;s hard to schedule in advance for gigs. San Francisco&#8217;s an expensive city and you need to be working all the time. So now, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay. So maybe a full-time thing.&#8221; Not only because of the money but also because of the peace of mind.</span></p>\n<p><b>What has the hunt been like and what have you learned about yourself in that process?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step was figuring out what I wanted to do and where I fit. Things like evangelism and marketing make a lot of sense, but they&#8217;re not really what I&#8217;m passionate about. Now I&#8217;m looking at product management. I&#8217;m looking at working with many different teams to kind of oversee the development and creation of a product, because I love building things. I love having my fingers in all sorts of different pots, so being able to work with the engineering team and with the marketing team and sales and all the different groups that come together to build something amazing. </span></p>\n<p><b>Do you think that you will host at all? How would it feel like to potentially leave a decade of community behind?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to leave all of that behind. Sword and Laser is just such a part of who I am at this point; that&#8217;s not something that I have to give up. But I hope I can kind of keep some of that audience and keep that conversation going through being active on things like Twitter, and Facebook, and Snapchat. I&#8217;m still going to love the things I love and want to talk about the things I&#8217;m passionate about, it just won&#8217;t be such a major part of my job anymore.</span></p>\n<p><b>Oh, man. Exciting times.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We&#8217;ll see!</span></p>\n<p><b>Okay, let&#8217;s go macro for a second. What do you think about the state of tech in 2016? What are you excited about? What are you frustrated about? What would you like to see change?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is confused as fuck right now because it wants to be more inclusive and it wants to be more diverse, but I don&#8217;t think it knows how to be both of those things. So I&#8217;m excited to see how bringing in more diversity, more different kinds of voices into the tech space can make it a better place for everyone. The more perspectives we have and the more voices we have only mean that products are going to get better and cater to more people, and that&#8217;s good for business. </span></p>\n<p><b>Do you have any thoughts on what you would like to see change in that realm in the next few years? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I&#8217;m just frustrated with, like, hot takes. And I don&#8217;t think that will ever go away from media [laughter], but I think it&#8217;s especially bad during an election cycle. It just becomes too overwhelming. I love deep dives, and that&#8217;s something that a lot of sites have gotten really good at doing. That&#8217;s kind of where I see the most value.</span></p>\n<p><b>Are you working on anything else? Any other projects for work or for yourself?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. In fact, I&#8217;m trying not to. I&#8217;m intentionally not taking any more freelance projects after the two that I&#8217;m working on right now end. So I can focus 100% on the next thing, whatever the next thing is. I just want a clear head and a clear calendar. I&#8217;ve got a few speaking gigs and I&#8217;ve got a couple of jobs to wrap up, and then I&#8217;m going full-bore into Veronica 2.0.</span></p>\n<p><b>I would say finding focus is a project in itself. I feel like all of last year I was trying to figure that out.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s hard [laughter].</span></p>\n<p><b>It takes time. It takes time.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s stressful.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in five or ten years?</b></p>\n<p>Still in San Francisco. And hopefully, being a voice in whatever new career path I have decided to take. I have a hard time not being outspoken about stuff, so I hope to keep communicating with people who are interested in the subjects that I&#8217;m excited about.</p>\n<p><b>What lessons have you learned from your time in tech that makes this whole career switch not so scary for you?  What gives you at least a little bit of peace of mind?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People want to help. And people want to help you make it. They want to connect you to the right people. They want to start the conversation and it feels really good to know that there&#8217;s people on your side. This is the one place where you could say you wanted to do anything and people are like, &#8220;How can I help?&#8221; And compared to where I grew up or most places on the East Coast or people would be just like, &#8220;Well, are you sure you can do that?&#8221; Whereas here, just not having the roadblocks associated with people just being like, &#8220;You can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; or when those are removed and people want to help, it&#8217;s like, this is the best place to do anything.</span></p>\n<p><b>What advice would you give to folks from similar backgrounds who are excited about tech and hoping to get into it as a career?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the advice I always give and I think it&#8217;s still is very true today as it was ten years ago, which is that if you&#8217;re passionate about something, you should be doing it already. You should be getting blogging, making a podcast. The barrier to entry is super low now. Do videos on YouTube. Build up a portfolio of stuff. If you&#8217;re a programmer, start building things get on GitHub, publish your stuff. It&#8217;s so easy now for someone to get attention building something cool, even if they&#8217;re not a known entity, just because you can put it up on Product Hunt or other ways for you to get noticed. You&#8217;ve just got to start hustling.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, I&#8217;m from Texas. I went to Texas Tech, a Texas football school. I I studied philosophy and kept going through grad school; I don&#8217;t have a CS degree. I’m not one of the people who started programming when I was six because I wanted to make a computer game. I got into tech because I moved to California, and I couldn’t find a philosophy job. One day I helped someone who was programming reason through a problem and afterwards they said, &#8220;You should do this for a living. I think you&#8217;d be good at it.&#8221; I was looking for a job, so that sounded great to try to do. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There weren&#8217;t bootcamps at the time, so I read one of the few books. It was a comic book, it was Why&#8217;s Poignant Guide, and I worked through all the examples. So I would was programming and would get particular output on the screen, but lacked a larger context for how things fit together. It didn’t help me understand how, for example, web applications work because the examples were pretty silly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was frustrated, and wanted to do what I called “real programming,” and ended up at a RailsBridge workshop. That became my first opportunity to get feedback about how much I knew and what I still needed to know, and that was fabulous. I found out that I knew a lot more than I realized, because books don&#8217;t tell you, &#8220;Good job. You&#8217;re progressing well.&#8221; I also found out, there are a lot of things I didn&#8217;t know, because a book also won&#8217;t tell you, &#8220;You need to learn this, and this, and this.&#8221; That was my first entrance into programming. And I&#8217;m still involved with RailsBridge, because it was a great experience for me. </span></p>\n<p><b>What were some of the things that came super easily, and then what were the things that became obvious, that you just didn&#8217;t know anything about, yet?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were two things that came easily. One was, reasoning about business logic. The business logic of &#8220;Here&#8217;s a problem. How do you solve it?&#8221; If you don’t code, this is like word problems in math, where you take a problem, and translate it into something solvable. Translating a word problem into code was relatively easy, probably because the type of philosophy that I studied was very logic-centric. Transcribing an argument into symbolic logic is very similar to, for example, &#8220;If these conditions are met, grab these kind of things and sort these things in this particular way.&#8221; That wasn&#8217;t such a big jump. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have to say, figuring out how to solve a well-scoped problem when I was working on my own was an entirely different skill than learning to write code that other people thought was good code; there are conventions that I had no idea about. And working in a way where I communicated out to others about what problems we were hitting, why it seemed important to prioritize doing particular things, and when people could expect us to be done. So finding out how to do things in a way that makes it easy for other people to work with you, that was also a fun, new skill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were other things. I was learning Ruby, but no one writes just Ruby. I needed to learn javascript, testing, weird browser fixes, and big things like how the internet works. And the point of all web apps  is to generate HTML, which is to say, generating a bunch of text. String manipulation, which sounds trivial, was a whole new world. RegEx-es took me an embarrassingly long time to understand. There were a lot of things that were not easy.</span></p>\n<p><b>All right. You taught yourself to code, walk me through your first experiences with putting that to work.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first time I tried to apply for an internship they said, &#8220;You know enough that you could do some things for us, but not enough that we will pay you for them. So I worked for free, and I can&#8217;t say I recommend it. I got tons of feedback about what my limitations were, about the difference between writing a small script or program, and write a mid-size web app that does what the client needs and other people want to work on. A lot of that was about learning to communicate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After working for free for several months, it became apparent that that consulting company wasn&#8217;t growing in a way that would create space for me. So I started interviewing, and I was asked questions that I could not answer at all, the traditional algorithmic, computer science questions. My response was initially &#8220;Do you need a computer scientist or do you need a web developer because I might be in the wrong interview?&#8221; But I learned that this is the proxy that we use to interview everybody apparently [chuckles].</span></p>\n<p><b>How have you adjusted to that or have you at all?</b></p>\n<p>Yeah, after getting my first real job, I had the space to start trying to learn things that I would have learned in school, including algorithms. I still brush up on algorithms before I interview, but also, I&#8217;m really skeptical of those types of interviews now. It seems like a bad shortcut. A better interview tries to evaluate what we actually need this person to do? For example, instead of asking about quick sort, which you probably don’t need me to know, ask me to spot and solve an “N + 1” query. Not designing a practical interview is a red flag to me now.</p>\n<p><b>It doesn&#8217;t seem so practical given that more and more people are teaching themselves to code.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exactly and you would miss out on amazing developers! Are those not the people that you want working with you because those are the people I would want working with me.</span></p>\n<p><b>Interesting. Walk me through some of the most exciting things that you&#8217;ve  worked on, or exciting things about working in Silicon Valley, things you&#8217;re proud of?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The things that I&#8217;ve been proud of have been getting to the point that I can push back on the received wisdom. If you think about the industry practices that everyone pushes for, for example, building mobile first (that you should always have a web experience that works for mobile), responsive design, how to track the performance of your website (which used to be server-focused and now is more browser-focused). I was focused on understanding and implementing a lot of what people said was best practice. And as an example, building service-oriented architecture was became orthodoxy for a little while. And I assumed that if that&#8217;s what all the blogs say, that must be right. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But when I started giving tech talks, that practice of being reflective and explaining to others what went wrong in projects I was on, and why, has been so wildly useful. So, the thing I think I&#8217;m proud of is I’ve gotten to a point, both in understanding the technology, and in my confidence level, that I feel comfortable challenging orthodoxy, challenging and pushing forward the conversation about how we should do things. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an example, I helped write a mobile web experience (built on backbone), and I unintentionally broke the way that we were doing our performance monitoring. And diving into what went wrong, it was obvious that this wasn’t just a problem for me and my team; this is an implication of building single page web apps. Everyone is having this problem, and if we like single page apps, we need to figure out a better way to do performance monitoring, because all the existing tools were built for server-side rendering. So in diving, I was at first horrified, and then really proud to have helped identify and propose solutions for this huge blind spot we had as a whole community.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, I love that.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making good arguments and pushing forward how we build our apps.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, solving a good problem. I love that. When did you turn your focus to improving culture?</b></p>\n<p>I was very hesitant to talk about culture. I worried that it would undermine my credibility as an engineer to not talk about strictly technical topics, which sounds ridiculous, but seemed real when I felt like I was struggling for credibility. When I joined an engineering team as the only woman (because it hadn&#8217;t occurred to me to ask in interview if there other women engineers at this company!), it was a little isolating. Okay, it was a lot isolating, and one thing I did to cope, was to do my best to pretend that I wasn&#8217;t a woman. I would wear the hoodie, wear the t-shirts, drink beer, and pretend that I’m just one of the guys. Then maybe I would have some kind of community. So I was really hesitant to stand up and say, &#8220;We have some major problems.&#8221; If I stand up and say, &#8220;This culture&#8217;s fucked,&#8221; then you&#8217;ll notice that I&#8217;m a woman, and you&#8217;ll notice I don&#8217;t fit in. Maybe you’ll kick me out.</p>\n<p>So I’ve never given talks about culture, but I’ve tried to change it. And I felt pushed into it. I was at a company where the majority of employees and all the customers were women; when I started I was the only woman engineer. After we hired three more women onto the engineering team, and we had all been there for a while, we found out that all the women engineers were being underpaid and under titled. When it was just me, my first assumption when I realized like I was getting paid a little bit less than all the guys was that maybe they&#8217;re all better than I am. But when it became a pattern and I knew for sure that the other women were just as good as the men, that was a push. So in every single meeting we had with an engineering manager, or a director, or VP, I would just bring this up. I would ask them what they were going to do about this, and when. I did my best to be loud and annoying to everyone in power at the company.</p>\n<p>But months went by and no one did anything or even had an answer for me. That changed when we got a new CTO, and in the intro my team had with the new CTO, I did the same thing &#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Rachel. Nice to meet you. You should that you have three amazing women on this team, and we&#8217;re all being under-titled and under-paid. This is your opportunity to do something about it.&#8221; And he did. He dumped money and titles on all of us, which was the right thing to do, but organization had already ruined the trust with the women engineers. So within six months we all left. That was my first push, knowing that the problem won&#8217;t solve itself. You can&#8217;t rely on the company to look out for you; it would be great if you could focus on doing great work because you knew the company would treat you and the other women fairly. In practice that doesn&#8217;t usually happen. And that was my radicalization.</p>\n<p><b>Yes, understandably. I remember having a moment realizing this guy who worked with me in our tiny 7-person startup, who had a very similar role to me, was being paid $50 thousand more than me.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s terrible!</span></p>\n<p><b>I eventually rage quit that company. But yeah, it&#8217;s absurd. Okay, where do I want to go from here? So tell me more about the culture work itself and the things you&#8217;ve been doing, the things you&#8217;ve been learning, working with other people on this. What have been, kind of, the big revelations?</b></p>\n<p>The number one revelation I would say is that the problems of white women are not the most important problems, which took me too long to figure out. When I was the only woman on the team, that seemed like the biggest problem to me. The larger problem, looking back on it, is that yes, we had one woman, but we didn&#8217;t have any black engineers. So trying to be aware enough of what all my biases are that I&#8217;m not standing in the way of other people has been pretty revelatory. Finding people who talk about their experiences, and being good at listening, that’s what I’m learning to do today. And I&#8217;m sure I fuck it up on a very regular basis, and I’m very practiced at apologizing as well.</p>\n<p><b>Let&#8217;s see. Other then that primary experience, what have been your other biggest struggles or biggest challenges in your work?</b></p>\n<p>I talk more and more about how to build teams and scope work, because that’s been a pain point at my current job. I work at GitHub, and the first week that I was there, I set up my dev environment, and I waited for someone to tell me what they needed me to build. And that didn&#8217;t happen. Instead of having a plan for what they wanted people to work on, they told everyone, &#8220;You&#8217;re smart. Figure out what to build and build it.&#8221; Which in retrospect, is so silly. It means that no one&#8217;s thinking about a long-term plan, coming up with where the company should be in, say, five years. If no one&#8217;s doing that, then every single person is trying to pull the product in a different direction.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I found it to be really challenging. I spent a long time wondering if I was contributing in a way that is valuable and meaningful, because no one ever communicated about that. Eventually I just forced myself to believe that I was doing valuable work, even if no one else noticed or ever told me so. When someone happened to notice and appreciate what I did, I had to make a huge effort to remember that, because there was so little feedback. At the time we didn&#8217;t have managers. No one was walking around saying “This is really valuable to the company. It&#8217;s great that you did this.” Because I don’t think many people knew what was great for the company. So knowing that I was doing a good job was up to me. That’s a hard place to be. I want to be good at my job. I want to be successful at this. And knowing I’m on the right track would have been really valuable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I didn&#8217;t experience quite that way but somewhere like working in a tiny, tiny startup, and you&#8217;re like young, and you aren&#8217;t totally sure if you&#8217;re right. Eventually realize that no one knows what they&#8217;re doing, but you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing, and when you don&#8217;t have anyone telling you where to go, it&#8217;s kind of like, &#8220;Okay. Well, we&#8217;re going to work in this vacuum, and hope that it works.&#8221; And then it works. Or like &#8211; and I think that the downside of that is that some people, they think it&#8217;s going well,  they think it&#8217;s going well. The only feedback you ever get, that could be negative. Like, we&#8217;re not very good at saying, This is marvelous.&#8221; right? So, I think that&#8217;s probably a larger problem than just our company, but it&#8217;s especially bad.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. And it&#8217;s such a negative oriented feedback trade, because it&#8217;s problem-solving, &#8220;There is a problem, there is a problem, there is a problem.&#8221; And it can affect you emotionally.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, I attach so much personal importance to my work, and to just be told that it&#8217;s wrong, not that it could be better.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, for sure. Where did you find your support networks early on/where you find them now? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The support network has always been women at the places that I&#8217;m working at and women at other companies that go through similar things. It&#8217;s really valuable to have friends at work. If you&#8217;re in a meeting and someone talks over you, it’s great to ask a friend &#8220;Did you see that? Were they talking over me or was that in my head?&#8221; They can also boost you up, I have a friend, Lara Hogan, and she has a blog post called, &#8216;You Are An Amazing Beyoncé Dragon&#8221;. It’s a phrase her friend texted her before she went on stage to give a huge keynote. Lara was terrified, and her friend text her, &#8220;Lara, chill out. You&#8217;re an amazing Beyoncé dragon and you&#8217;re going to kill it on that stage.&#8221; And her response was “Oh, right! I really am an amazing Beyoncé dragon.” No guy is ever going to tell you that; only women friends who know what you’re up against and know how fucking amazing you are, can tell you. I have a few friends I talk to every day, some at work, and some I don’t work with any more, particularly Emily Nakashima, and they’re my go-to for reality checks. When things are good or things are fucked they are there to say like, &#8220;Yay!&#8221; or &#8220;fuck all that!&#8221;. That’s the support network, and it’s amazing.</span></p>\n<p><b>Similar but different &#8211; have you had mentors or people that you&#8217;ve looked up to or like people who have kind of been pivotal in your life along the way.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think there are two good chapters of &#8220;Lean In&#8221;, and they’re the two things that Sheryl Sandberg actually knows about. One is about salary negotiation, and one is about mentorship. I really appreciate her view, but in my experience, it paints this very rosey picture of mentorship as something that everyone is constantly getting things out of. And that has not always been my experience with mentorship. I&#8217;ve experienced mentors who really, really want to mentor me, but it sometimes feels like clipping my wings, keeping me from trying things and maybe flying a bit. The best mentors have been people who are just like one step up from me in their career. They&#8217;re not a hero exactly but they&#8217;re, just far enough ahead that they can be a great example, they can give really good direction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I think I&#8217;ve gotten more out of those relationships than I have out of working with the aspirational, amazing heroes who don’t have the problems that I have. I know that organizationally it can be great to have someone that is looking out for your career in that organization and I don’t  think I&#8217;ve had quite that experience. Someday I&#8217;ll corner Sheryl Sandberg and ask her if her mentorship experience has really always been so perfect.</span></p>\n<p><b>One day. </b><b>What are your biggest motivators, what drives you in your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have two main motivations. I want to build things that help people. And, a subset of that is that I want to help people who need help. So it&#8217;s one thing to build things for everyone, for example, I could probably get a job at YouTube, and build something for everyone. But I especially want to work on projects that will help people that need help. The project that I&#8217;m working on at GitHub is to make GitHub a more welcoming, accessible, helpful experience to people that are learning to code. And these are people who we have traditionally not gotten a lot of help; it&#8217;s been a tool for developers, by developers. If you are not yet a developer, we don’t do a great job helping you or optimizing for your workflow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you create a repository without initializing it with a readme, we show you commands to copy and paste into the terminal. If you’re learning JavaScript, you can get pretty far doing things in the browser, without the terminal. So you could see that, and decide this tool isn&#8217;t for you. And that will limit you. You&#8217;re not going to feel welcome in the community. You&#8217;re not going to feel like you can create issues on projects you&#8217;re using. In a world (lazy?) recruiters think a GitHub profile fully captures a developer’s potential, it’s important that we break down those barriers, and make a better experience for people learning to code. The ripples on that change hopefully go out for a while.</span></p>\n<p><b>Cool. That&#8217;s really awesome. Similar question, but different. What is important to you in a job today versus when you started?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t have to prove myself anymore. I don&#8217;t want to prove myself, because I’m confident that I’m doing good work and building good things. I want to be picky and work with people who want to go in the same direction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone says they don&#8217;t want to work with assholes, but sometimes they don&#8217;t have a clear idea what an asshole is, so it’s an empty statement. I have a lot of  clarity on that now and I&#8217;m not interested in spending my time on people who don’t want to learn.  Everyone has their off days and good people sometimes have bad behavior. But on the whole, I&#8217;m not going to spend a lot of emotional energy being a babysitter to my teammates. I want to work with grownups and prefer projects that help people who need help.</span></p>\n<p><b>Cool. How do your friends and family from home feel about the work that you&#8217;ve done? You&#8217;re from Texas. I&#8217;m from North Carolina. Are they just like, &#8220;What is a startup? We don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. They&#8217;re mostly like that. I&#8217;ve tried to explain version control to members of my family and  I&#8217;ve had different degrees of success there. I overheard my mom tell her friends what I do, and it was &#8220;She writes code.&#8221;  Her friends had questions and she was like, &#8220;She writes code. Ask her any further questions.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My brother’s a mechanical engineer, and we have conversations about things like when to change jobs, or perks like working from home. My current company is remote friendly, and that’s a huge perk. Last week a friend and coworker who lives in a different state was feeling down; I went to see her and we co-worked together for two weeks. My brother thought that was pretty crazy.</span></p>\n<p><b>I kind of want to go back to thing that we talked about where you were hiding your femininity for early years of your work. Now that you&#8217;ve kind of going into your career and you&#8217;re confident. You don&#8217;t give a shit about proving yourself to people. How have you changed how you portrayed yourself?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, my self-presentation is very different. A really common form of self expression in tech is the stickers people put on their laptop, and I didn’t put any tech companies on mine. I went to etsy and bought feminine and feminist stickers for my laptop. I have one that says “bad bitch”, several Lisa Frank stickers, a cat, a batgirl, etc.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">literally talked about Lisa Frank a few hours ago in another social scenario.</span></p>\n<p>In my little corner of tech, and I hope it&#8217;s more widespread, there’s been a big change. Five years ago, as a group, we hid our femininity and pretended we were just one of the guys. Now we’ve embraced it, we have `#nailcomf` and :nail_care: emoji as a symbol. I don&#8217;t have to wear tech shirt everyday. And I like wearing nice clothes at work; I spent a lot of time not dressing up to fit in, and that&#8217;s not really who I am. I enjoy wearing cute shoes and sweaters with animals on them. It doesn’t mean I’m less good at my job. When someone trivializes me because I’m wearing a dress, which doesn’t happen often, I’m in a place where I can explain how absurd that is.</p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s really exciting. I feel ten years younger, now that I work for myself. It&#8217;s just so cool to see how people change once they don&#8217;t feel like they have to be a certain way.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah.</span></p>\n<p><b>Let&#8217;s see. What do you think about the state of tech in 2016? What is exciting to you? What frustrates you? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It seems like tech is in a much at not blindly listening to heros. Conferences have talks with diametrically opposed positions. Culturally, it&#8217;s exciting that people want to talk about getting better. For example, I&#8217;m glad lots of places are doing the work that does into publishing diversity numbers. I’d be much more interested in blog posts about how companies define their diversity problem. Given what they see as their biggest problems, what are they trying to fix it, and what is working and not working? Tell me about those things. The dashboard reporting isn’t proposing new ways of doing things. A lot of people are on their heels and are focused on getting good publicity. And I hope that soon we can move past that. It&#8217;s cool that we&#8217;re talking about diversity as opposed to not talking about it, but there are some deeper conversations we could be having.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, for sure. How do you think your background and life experiences impact the way that you approach your work now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My background completely impacts my work right now. If you are self-taught, and learning, I want the product I’m working on to help you learn. My background very much informs wanting to be on this team; wanting to be on this project, and help it go  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. What are you working on right now &#8211; you&#8217;ve talked about for work &#8211; but like for yourself? Anything in particular?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a lot of attempts at just side projects. Every time a friend has a problem, we start brainstorming a technical solution. Our immediate response to a lot of problems is &#8220;Let&#8217;s make an app.&#8221; I have lots of repositories of just trying to figure out what a rough draft could possibly look like. Most of them I drop, but some we make, just poking at the problem.</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in five or ten years? Do you think you&#8217;ll still be here?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tech can be really exhausting. Everyone&#8217;s learning on the job and that can be really frustrating. Engineers learning to be managers marginalize, under-title, and underpay people of color and women, and I see that happen over and over again. That’s exhausting. I don&#8217;t think I can put up with that forever; at least I don’t want to. I like to code. My hope for five or ten years is to find a way to spend my time coding and work with people who aren’t going to climb a ladder by pushing other people down. That&#8217;s the dream. And I don&#8217;t think Silicon Valley helps me toward that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hopefully, in five years I&#8217;ve figured out how to do  build cool things and worry less about  industry problems.</span></p>\n<p><b>My last question for you would be what advice would give to folks from similar backgrounds who are just getting started in tech or hoping to get into it. What would you wish you would have known?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I felt a lot of pressure to try to prove myself very quickly and I think if I could go back and talk a younger me or someone who is getting hired today I think I would say that’s not really necessary. You can move at your pace. I went to meet ups every night when I was getting started because there might be some new thing I need to know about. I would wake up early and read text books. I worked during work, but I felt like there was so much to catch up on that I worked all the time out of a sense inadequacy, because I was self-taught. So if I could go back, I would say, there&#8217;s no need to do that. Find a steady pace that works for you. Find jobs where you will be supported in learning and learn on the job. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And this is a thing I still do. I feel so much pressure to figure out things out, instead of asking. But when I have the good sense to ask, people are often, if not always, helpful. I’m not a bad programmer because there’s something I don’t know. That&#8217;s not true at all. I was really bad at asking question, imagining that I would be making all women look bad. If I could wave a magic wand, I would like every woman who&#8217;s starting out to feel like she can ask any question that she wants to.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><strong>Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, I was born on the East Coast and we moved around a great deal. It&#8217;s probably—may not be relevant that my dad was previously trying to be a computer programmer because of my mom who had been a math teacher, and then went into—became a systems analyst, and later like a manager up to vice president of systems groups, so more in sort of hardware and software selection than in the actual programing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But they split up and I grew up with my mom, and she worked in computers and—I have a story more than a memory that when I was like six she took me into the office with her, and she was working at Macy&#8217;s at the time, and so I went into the machine room with all the programmers, and for whatever reason one of them taught me to count in Hex which I didn&#8217;t even get until much later in math when we were doing different bases, and I was like, &#8220;Wow, I remember that from&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She actually did not think being in computers was a good thing. It was a good career for her because she was a manager and telling people what to do. She had the math background and understood things very well. In fact, she&#8217;s still doing that. She&#8217;s 76 now and she&#8217;s still working as a manager of computer projects like selecting the machinery and selecting the software and setting up a group, that kind of thing. I used to say “she&#8217;s a system analyst” when I was a kid and I had no idea what that was. No clue at all [laughter].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I went to college I still actually didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to do. I was fairly young. I graduated high school when I was 15, so I wasn&#8217;t that aware of what was going on in the world, even though I was pretty sure I knew everything of course [chuckles]. I took her advice of what college to go to and on what to study to some degree, but I went to an expensive college back east, so I had to do work study. The options for work study were work in the computer lab, work in the administration office, or work in food service. I was like, &#8220;Well, the computer lab sounds best to me.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At that point I hadn&#8217;t had a lot of connection to computers Some of my friends in high school had had an Apple 2 of their own, but my high school did not have a computer lab. My high school in Virginia did, but then we moved to California, and what with prop 13 and all, my high school in California had nothing. I didn&#8217;t really get into them very much, except to play with my friend&#8217;s computer a few times. A couple times my mom would bring something home from work, though she didn&#8217;t do much work at home, so I didn&#8217;t really see a lot of it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I get to college and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I want to work in the computer lab, but I don&#8217;t really know much about computers, so I&#8217;ll take a Basic programming class, the intro programming class.&#8221; That was so much fun, and I started to spend all my time online, writing extra programs and playing the games that they had at the time, which were fairly primitive. Adventure, that kind of thing. I got very into it, so I took another computer class and another computer class. I switched colleges to San Francisco State out here, and I started working in the computer lab there and just taking more and more classes both in what at the time was called the information Science department, which was business computing. Stuff like Cobol, accounting, statistical packages, that kind of thing. Also in the Computer—well, what was the Math department then and became the Computer Science department before I graduated. That was a fairly common evolution at that time, for the classes to start in the math department.</span></p>\n<p>About halfway through college I went to the ACM programming contest with some friends of mine from the computer lab, and then the computer science department—which was still pretty new—was like, &#8220;why aren&#8217;t you a computer science student if you&#8217;re going to the programming contest to represent our school?&#8221;. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;oh, okay, sure, I&#8217;ll study computers&#8221;. Then I actually signed up for the degree program and got a degree in computer science. For the longest time I was honestly just doing it because it was fun and that&#8217;s what my friends did because we were all hanging out at the lab. I wasn&#8217;t really planning on a career; it was just the thing I enjoyed most in college was being in the computer lab, working on the computers, helping people get their stuff done, and it just kind of evolved.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I graduated college in ‘87 and at that point it was mostly defense contractors. There weren&#8217;t a lot of startups. Banks and big companies and that kind of thing. I interviewed at Lockheed and I interviewed at a small company in Berkeley that was doing natural language processing. It was a start-up before there were start-ups all over the place. I didn’t like the idea of working on spy satellite software, even though I&#8217;m sure it would have been fascinating as a problem. So I went to work with the start-up in Berkeley.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was there for seven years and then it was time to move on. I thought, “I&#8217;m doing the same thing here over and over. I want to do something different.” It wasn&#8217;t as common then for people to change jobs every two years. I didn&#8217;t, at that time, really think of changing as a thing, until I was so tired of doing the same thing all the time and so stressed by the small company thing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then I went to work for a larger company, a database company. One of my friends was working there and I had just been saying on my friends mailing list, &#8220;I&#8217;d really like a new job.&#8221; and she was like, &#8220;come work with me.&#8221; I went to work there and after that, I took a short break and did web contracting, because the web was suddenly a thing and I was a little burnt out on working. That was in the mid 90&#8217;s. I wasn&#8217;t that good. I&#8217;m not a designer at all. I&#8217;m terrible with graphics and all  all that. So HTML was easy to learn, but it&#8217;s hard to really do something good with it without having a sense for design and user interface. That was all pretty new at the time, web design. So all the sites were just awful. I was not much worse than anyone else, but these days they would be absolutely terrible. And yet people were willing to pay me for it because nobody was doing it then. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And then when I went back into a full-time job, it was the dot-com era. I got a job and I was like, &#8221;Wow. It&#8217;s a job in San Francisco.&#8221; Because I&#8217;ve been living in San Francisco since we moved here when I was in high school. But I was commuting down the Peninsula and over to Berkeley because that&#8217;s where the companies were. Then I got a job with an e-commerce company in  San Francisco. I was like, &#8221;This is great. I can commute to work on the MUNI.&#8221; Which was still not dreadful at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I started working there, and I worked there for four years, and finally, it was kind of the same thing. The work became pretty much the same, and it was still a startup with no real income even after four years. I got a little tired of “every time you walk in you have to something to save the company because it&#8217;s going to go under.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;If it&#8217;s going to go under unless I mobilize and stress out every day, I don&#8217;t really want to be involved in that.&#8221; I was getting more sensible by then. I still spent then and spend now almost all my time online. If something went wrong, I&#8217;d be there. I&#8217;d be there to help out at 2:00 in the morning or whatever. I don&#8217;t mind that, but I do mind the expectation that everyone will do that. Like I&#8217;m there because I happen to be there. I happen to be doing my own thing. I don&#8217;t want to be working literally from the moment I wake up to the moment I sleep anymore—although when I was younger, that was fine. I really didn&#8217;t mind. I really love what I do.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not that I feel like I have to work that much, but I&#8217;m always interested and you can&#8217;t really turn it off. Like you&#8217;re working on something and you go home, and it&#8217;s still in your head. Even in the early days we still had dial-ups or we still had the source code on our machines that we could move around. You can keep working as much as you want to keep working and if you really like what you do, it&#8217;s hard to stop. It&#8217;s hard for anything to not be part of it. So I worked there for four years and then it was a series of dotcoms that went under—at that time, they were all going under.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually I went to work for—I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m so tired of companies dying out from under me. Get me a job at something that&#8217;s not going to die.&#8221; So one of my friends was working at Wells Fargo, and she said, &#8220;Come work here, it’ll never go under.&#8221; After I was there for about six months, another one of my friends from another of the startups that had died, we were having dinner and he—and we&#8217;re talking about I&#8217;m ranting or about my job and he says, &#8220;They&#8217;re destroying your soul. Come work with me [laughter].&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yeah. You&#8217;re probably right.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And so I went to work with him at a Dotcom 2.0, a company called Shopping.com. That was wonderful. They were great. I was there for about three years but they got purchased by Ebay and became really, really, really boring. A lot of people I worked with there, I have worked with again since then because it just was another of those atmospheres that was really amazing. The first dotcom, I was the second engineer I guess, so I just hired all my friends. As we needed more people, I&#8217;d be like, &#8220;Well, I got a friend who could help us out.&#8221; It was good then. After I’ve been in the business for like 10, 15 years, it starts to get harder to get your friends to come work with you because they&#8217;re very happy where they are. They’ve found a nice place and so instead you go work where your friends are when you decide you need something new.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, I&#8217;ve been working for a number of companies, mostly smaller ones. I really, on the whole, prefer start-ups or relatively small companies where I can understand all of what&#8217;s going on. But after my last start-up got bought by Facebook, one of my friends from Shopping.com was working at Twitter and he said, &#8220;You should come work at Twitter.&#8221; So I went down there and it was really nice. They were in their new building and the food was excellent. I had really liked working with him before and his team was very nice, so I went to work there. That was the largest company I&#8217;ve been at since Wells Fargo and one of the largest companies I&#8217;ve ever been at and it was growing like crazy while I was there. When I interviewed, I think they had about 1,200 people and by the time I was actually starting work, they had over 1,500. Then by the time I left they had about 3,000. That was two and half years later.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did not like the bigness. I did not like the bureaucracy. I did not like the corporate-ness of it all. So I was like, &#8220;All right, this time I&#8217;m going to try to find something in between because I don&#8217;t want to be stressed out with a start-up that&#8217;s going to die everyday, but I also don&#8217;t want to be working at a big company where I just have no idea what&#8217;s going on.&#8221; Like, all I know is my little area and the communication is not great and all. That&#8217;s just natural to big organizations. Now I&#8217;m working at Instacart with another of the people I used to work with at Shopping.com and actually, one of my friends from Twitter came to work here as well. It&#8217;s a nice size. It&#8217;s got under a hundred engineers so you could squeeze all the engineers into the cafeteria and have us all talk to each other at once, which is pretty good. So that&#8217;s a very long-winded summary but nonetheless brief because I&#8217;ve actually worked for—I think I&#8217;ve counted 12 companies in, what is it now, 29 years. So, there&#8217;s more [laughter]. Those are the highlights.</span></p>\n<p><b>What about your work really, really excites you in actually true to the core?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, it&#8217;s puzzles. I love puzzles. I&#8217;m a gamer of all sorts: jigsaw puzzles, other kinds of puzzles, card games, board games, role playing games, video games, all of it. I used to play video games in the arcades when I was in high school and college and I didn&#8217;t have a console until much later. I still think of video games as standing up with the machine, even though now I sit on the couch and play with the controller. My favorites are always the puzzle solving ones. I think of most problems in software as being solving a puzzle because making a computer do what you want to do, in itself, is a simple but interesting puzzle. Even more so when something goes wrong. Then you have to envision the whole system and figure out where the problem came in and what you can do to correct it without breaking everything else around it. To me that&#8217;s very jigsaw puzzle-ish in conception because you have a lot of pieces that perhaps look a lot like or could be parts of almost anything and we have to be careful how we put it together. That&#8217;s a very strange analogy but still it&#8217;s how it feels when working on it.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are your biggest motivators? What drives you?</b></p>\n<p>Oddly, I feel like it&#8217;s the people. Both the people that I&#8217;m making the software for and the people I&#8217;m making the software with.  Day to day I can come in and not speak to my team all day. We might chat on Slack or something but it&#8217;s not really the same, although I do think of it very much the same. I&#8217;ve been chatting online since I was 16 and I had a lot of just social chats and social email lists, and then it was newsgroups and forums and so on. I see working with computers as extremely social. To me it has always been an interactive thing.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was in high school, the one contact I had with computers was going over to hang out at friend’s house who had a computer. When I was in college I was always in the computer lab with my friends who were also in that lab or who were in other labs and we&#8217;d be chatting online and talking about all sorts of things, not just technical work, but certainly that was part of what we talked about. Writing programs for each other, sharing code, pretty “open source” before that was a thing. You would even hand other people a print-out and they&#8217;d type it in; whatever it took but you always shared.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of what makes me stop liking a job is when I don&#8217;t feel a good sense of being a team with the other people I&#8217;m working with. When I start to feel isolated in some way, whatever it may be, it can be from the company standpoint when I feel like the company doesn&#8217;t consider the programmers or it could be from the developer standpoint where I feel like I have a lot of disagreements or disconnects with the other developers when our style or our sense of what&#8217;s right is not the same. But, as long as I have that good feeling that I&#8217;m part of something, I’m happy, and similarly I love web development and tools development because I feel a lot closer to the customers that way.</span></p>\n<p>When I was doing package software back in the early days, my first company I actually did customer support, so they would send me to a customer to find out what their problems were at a technical level. I&#8217;d actually sit down with their database and their software and dig into whatever their product domain was, whatever their business domain was, and try to help customize our software for them. Then I&#8217;d bring problems back to the office and sit with the other developers and we&#8217;d try to work out ways to deal with these unusual problems that I might encounter out in the wild. And then when I worked with the database company, it was really disappointing because I had no connection to the user or how they were using the software, and then when I got on the web, websites had a more direct sense of interaction with people because they&#8217;re built for people, rather than being built for computers. Even more so, these days, I do a lot of internal tools work, because then, not only am I a part of “the team” from a company standpoint, but I&#8217;m helping another part of the team and I can get direct feedback from them if something is not helping or something goes wrong. So yes, it&#8217;s very, very social and it&#8217;s very, very much about people.</p>\n<p><b>Let&#8217;s flip to the dark side for a second. What have been some of your biggest struggles and roadblocks over the course of your career?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[chuckles] At Wells Fargo—I mean, mostly I&#8217;ve been really happy. At Wells Fargo, I was frustrated as a developer and the reason my friend said they were destroying my soul, I said to him, &#8220;Well, they’re forcing me to do a bad work on an evil product” [laughter]. Although really, the product wasn&#8217;t evil, it was just telephone banking, but the process that they had was to develop a product spec of like hundreds of pages, and then get it signed off by dozens of people, and then essentially, it&#8217;s thrown over the wall to the programmers, and we would try to implement it and then we&#8217;d come back, and we&#8217;d be like, &#8220;Well this is impossible. Literally, not physically possible.&#8221; And they&#8217;d be like, &#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t change the spec.&#8221; So then you&#8217;re like [chuckles], &#8220;Why are you not rational? Why don&#8217;t you understand that a computer simply cannot do this. So you have to change the spec.&#8221; &#8220;We cannot change the spec. It&#8217;s been signed off.&#8221; Then you&#8217;re like, &#8220;This is insane world. I can&#8217;t live in this world. I need a world that is more rational.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s the worst example, but of course, there&#8217;s always examples like that. You always have things which are being decided by product people and then brought to the engineers later, and then you have to deal with people&#8217;s idea of what it is that you can do. Often, I find, it’s even worse when they&#8217;re trying to be nice to you. So they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Well, we want this.&#8221; And if you go back and you say, &#8220;Why do you want that?&#8221; they&#8217;re like, &#8220;I thought it was easier. What I really want is this.&#8221; And then you’re like &#8220;Oh, what you really want is much easier than what you asked for [chuckles].&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think during the early days, though, there was a lot more disconnect. These days, I&#8217;m working at companies where the product managers are much more technical, much more involved, and frequently embedded with the actual group that they&#8217;re supporting, so they know what&#8217;s going on day to day. So that&#8217;s gotten a lot better. But it was definitely frustrating and difficult in the earlier days.</span></p>\n<p>Then, at Twitter I ran into a very different problem which I had never encountered before, which was being female, [chuckles] and I never—I was always mostly at small companies and I might be the one woman on a team of ten. But, I never really felt it. We were just all the developers. Then other times like at eGreetings, where I got a bunch of my friends hired, it was about half and half, actually—not precisely half and half, but certainly pretty close to it— and I didn&#8217;t really feel it there either. I didn&#8217;t feel it one way or the other. Although we did used to joke there that all the people in marketing were almost the same attractive blonde woman, I think because the guy who ran marketing might have had a little bit of a preference, but I think also just there always has tended to be more women in marketing and more men in software engineering.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, at eGreetings since it was the early dot-com days, practically anybody who could pick up a book on HTML would become a web developer. And so we also had an extensive team of people who did the web site things—the HTML—and they were also mostly female, so that also contributed, I think, to the feeling there that it was very evenly distributed. Other places—it&#8217;s back and forth, but I never really felt it until I went to Twitter. I went to Twitter, and I could, literally, go all day without seeing another woman. Every meeting I went to, all the people I worked with, all the people on my team—If I didn&#8217;t look up from my computer, and I just went to meetings, I&#8217;m the only one there. And somehow I started to feel it in a way that I had not felt it previously. I don&#8217;t know, really, what the situation is there—in terms of what the management thinks—but I do know that I went and counted, and there was only like seven percent women, as far as engineers go, and they were all at the lower levels. So, at the higher levels it was men. The management chain—you looked at anybody&#8217;s management chain and it was almost certainly six men. There might be one woman in there. I just started to feel really different. I&#8217;d never felt different before, I  was always—I won&#8217;t say one of the guys because it wasn&#8217;t like that. They were—I dated lots of them. They didn&#8217;t think of me as a guy, but I was one of the engineers and not “the female engineer” on the team. You know what I mean? And at Twitter you&#8217;ll be like—There were three of us who got together once in awhile, and one of us was invited to every interview, to every interview panel, to prove that Twitter had female engineers or something. I don&#8217;t know. It was really bad. Because it—Like, &#8220;Why am I interviewing for some team that, not only am I not on but I don&#8217;t even know what they do.&#8221; And they still put me on the interview panel because the team didn&#8217;t have any women [laughter].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had been really interested in feminism and feminist issues back in college, as you do, and I posted a lot on soc.feminism, and I eventually became a moderator there, and I talked about all these issues at length, and then I just kind of forgot about it for 20 years. Not because I felt the problem was solved, I know the problem wasn&#8217;t solved, but it wasn&#8217;t really bothering me and wasn&#8217;t really bothering my friends and—Even though every once in awhile, I&#8217;d say something in a group discussion or somebody would talk to me as “the female engineer”, it just wasn&#8217;t a thing from day to day, until at Twitter it became a thing where I was really, really feeling it. So, I started getting involved in discussions there about the level of diversity, and arguments, and so on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other thing that I felt was my age—not that people commented on that—but that everyone there was so inexperienced in comparison. In fact, when I was hired they were arguing with me about my pay. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re going to make more than anyone else on your team.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I’ve got 20 years more experience than anyone else on my team.&#8221; So, I’m not going to take a pay cut. [laughter] There were so many times when—they&#8217;re these very, very bright people, but they just were not practical. They had not had experience putting things into production. So, they do a great job developing, but the sense of ownership, of maintaining it, of consideration for other developers—the person who would come next—how are they going to deal with your code? When you&#8217;ve done this really, really clever thing, but you haven&#8217;t explained it or tested it, or anything, how is that going to work when someone has to maintain it? Nobody wants to fix bugs. Everybody wants to be developing exciting new features. It&#8217;s all the shiny new object. and I was just like, &#8220;Believe me. My experience tells me that what you&#8217;re doing is a bad idea,&#8221; and they just don&#8217;t get it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even the people in management, they&#8217;re only a couple of years older. They&#8217;ve had no experience. And so I kept running into conflict with people because I was like, &#8220;No. I&#8217;m really, really, really sure that this is true,&#8221; that we need to do maintenance, that we need to have people who are focused on keeping the old stuff clean and working, and we have to every once in awhile clean up the platform. And everybody just had this really short-term point of view. “Everybody” is an exaggeration, with a thousand engineers of course there are people of all sorts of viewpoints, but just so frequently I would be meeting with people and trying to convince them that after 20 years of experience, I actually knew what I was talking about, and I couldn&#8217;t do it. And I was just like, &#8220;What&#8217;s going on here,&#8221; because again, I&#8217;ve never had that problem before. People had always had a similar point of view and even when it wasn&#8217;t similar, it was close enough they&#8217;d get what I was saying. And suddenly it was like being in a foreign country and I think I&#8217;m speaking the language, but I&#8217;m just not.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I have no idea what  how that happened, but my sense is that—and from also looking into a lot more things about diversity, bias, and all of that—they started with a core of people who were very similar, and then in order to, quote, not lower the bar, which they literally said, hired more and more people who were precisely like the people they already had, until they just ended up with this great homogeneity of person and thought, which was really hard to pierce, because—I mean, you see this, when talking about political things too, where people are presented with contrary evidence to their political view it oddly actually reinforces them in their original incorrect view, rather than them learning. And in part that is because everyone else they know agrees with them. So the more you&#8217;re in an environment where everyone agrees, if you are the person who doesn&#8217;t agree, if you are the person who&#8217;s different, you can&#8217;t get through that, because everyone&#8217;s backing them up. “Yes, you&#8217;re right, you&#8217;re the same as me, we agree, we understand”.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That sense of being different was really odd to me, really, really odd, because I had never had that sense. And it was very difficult to work, because I felt constantly on the outside of everything; in some sense not wanted, right? Nobody wants to hear it. Nobody wants to be challenged. Nobody wants to hear that they&#8217;re doing it wrong or at least you think they&#8217;re doing it wrong. So, I was “too aggressive” and eventually—yeah, I know. And I&#8217;m like, well I mean, in a way I am, nobody would describe me as retiring in a work sense. I&#8217;m actually reasonably shy with new people in a social sense. But, at work certainly I&#8217;ve never been one to just shut up and let things go. But again, my experience in developers has been that they welcome better ideas and to have people just shut off any different ideas, forget better, right, like obviously I think it&#8217;s better, but, it&#8217;s “different”, and one of the things I love actually about the job is that discussion and that argument and that debate to try to find the best possible solution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the things that attracted me to the field in the first place was that it was so much more logical and so much more deterministic than people are—software, it either works or it doesn&#8217;t and it works faster or it doesn&#8217;t work faster and it works better or it doesn&#8217;t work better. And so, while there are certainly still things that are subjective, there are a lot of objective measurements and a lot of ways to be able to determine &#8220;Yes this is right or at least this is not wrong.&#8221; Even when we&#8217;ve gotten into the most contentious arguments, I just enjoy that. I enjoy that we&#8217;re arguing to get better and not arguing because you have one what I would call religious view and I have a different religious view. Vi vs. emacs, you&#8217;ll never settle that, but you recognize that it&#8217;s a matter, if you will, of faith or belief and not a matter of fact. Eventually you just stop arguing about that one and you do your own thing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For questions like, &#8220;Should we upgrade to the latest version of Ruby?&#8221; I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a matter of opinion or religion. I think that it&#8217;s a matter of fact that you have to keep your tools up to date. I&#8217;ve seen over and over again that when we don&#8217;t do that things go wrong. Then people are saying, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s too much trouble to do that.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;It&#8217;s too much trouble not to do that.&#8221; I&#8217;m good at compromise but I&#8217;m not good at letting things which are wrong go by. If I believe it&#8217;s my own feeling I&#8217;m perfectly happy to compromise, but if I think that it&#8217;s really truly wrong, then I just plant my feet. And that&#8217;s I guess not so good [chuckles]. I&#8217;m not going to stop, but it certainly can cause trouble.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, but it&#8217;s interesting that you&#8217;ve had so much perspective in that it was okay and it worked for a long time.</b></p>\n<p>Well, at my new job it works a lot better. Even though again, I&#8217;m probably one of the oldest people here, and there&#8217;s only a fraction of people who I think have even ten years experience. I feel like the people here are much more open and much more of my viewpoint. So that&#8217;s another reason I think it&#8217;s not so much the industry, it&#8217;s the fact of when you collect a sort of critical mass of people who have the same viewpoint, and it makes it hard to be different. But as long as you have a community where everybody&#8217;s not from the same background and the same approximate age and social and everything, then it&#8217;s not so hard to disagree with people. That&#8217;s one of the things. I&#8217;m on the diversity committee here and to me, the important thing is not like specific characteristics of the person, but  the fact that they aren&#8217;t like everyone else. That we get that difference in viewpoint which allows people to continue to perceive that different viewpoints are valuable and okay. That&#8217;s the best environment to really learn in, too. So, I think it&#8217;s better for all the engineers, even if they don&#8217;t personally care.</p>\n<p><b>Did that experience immediately affect what you were looking for in your next job?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Absolutely. But it&#8217;s hard to define, right? I mean, how do you say, &#8220;I want a really open-minded team that&#8217;s open to different ideas.&#8221; Of course everybody is going to say, &#8220;Of course we are.&#8221; But in reality, people just aren&#8217;t even maybe aware of how much of a little bubble they&#8217;re in. Until they get hit in the face with it a few times [laughter].</span></p>\n<p><b>Where have you found your support networks, traditionally. Where did you find them early on and where do you find them now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In college, it was the other people in the computer lab and the people that I talked to online. There was a program called Talk and it was like a sort of a mini IRC, so like a small channel plus personal chatting, across the State University system. We all had access to it, although most people didn&#8217;t know about it, but the sort of hardcore computer geeks did. So I had friends all over California from the State University system and then after I started working there were people I had met both at school and there was a dinner group over at Berkeley that I used to go to and, again, it was computer people who just socialized once a week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I just had a lot of friends from those kind of groups. They were founded on being engineers to a great degree, but they were also social groups. And over time, you introduce those friends to other friends, you introduce people that you work with and they bring in people they work with, and so the group expands and certain people you have more in common with and you get to be personal friends, and other people you just kind of hang with in the group, you know? So when there are group events then they&#8217;re all there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I met people on Usenet. I met people occasionally through other interests, like I started going to board game conventions, so I’ve made friends there. As the industry has expanded, more and more of those people have turned out to be engineers, anyway.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So my circle of friends is still primarily engineers with, strangely, a bunch of lawyers who somehow crept in there. They seem to be big board gamers as well [laughter]. And then a few people from other areas. And then over time as I&#8217;ve been doing online gaming I&#8217;ve met people on there. And that&#8217;s actually where I get the most diverse group of friends is from online gaming because you get people from all over who—A lot of them it&#8217;s when they&#8217;re in college or if they&#8217;re unemployed or something. But a lot of people just keep at it for years and so I&#8217;ve met people from all over the world, people of all different ages and backgrounds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I even for a while was playing a game in China. It was hosted on servers in China and it was all Chinese people. And then there were a few of us who had gone there to play because they had the game before it was released in the US. And they were super nice. They&#8217;d find somebody who could speak English if they wanted me to join their group, and you I didn&#8217;t really get to be friends with many people because the language barrier was such that beyond the gaming it was really difficult. But they were friendly, you know? I&#8217;d say most of my friends I&#8217;ve probably met online or if I haven&#8217;t met them online, I&#8217;ve maintained the relationship online, and then college and jobs.</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m curious to know—going back to your earlier experiences—has that made you more drawn to finding and connecting with women in the workplace? I&#8217;m curious.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only in the sense that I&#8217;m more open to it than I was. When I went to Twitter, they had a Women in Engineering group that invited me to like a lunch or something as an employee. I was just like, &#8220;Eh. Whatever.&#8221; That had never been a thing for me, so I just didn&#8217;t bother. Of my friends, some of them are women, but the vast majority are men. I&#8217;m just generally more used to hanging out with them, which is another reason why it was so weird, feeling different from the other engineers. I&#8217;ve been in groups of men all the time. I never felt like it. So I didn&#8217;t go there, but when I came to Instacart, the female engineers were like, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s you know, get together for a drink. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Sure, let&#8217;s do it,&#8221; because I was like, &#8220;Alright. Maybe there&#8217;s a problem here that I should be involved in in helping solve.&#8221; As far as personally, apart from the issues that I&#8217;d like to see things improve in tech generally, no. In general my friends are men and they always have been.</span></p>\n<p><b>Let&#8217;s go macro for a second. How do you feel about the overall state of tech in 2016? What excites you, what frustrates you, what would you like to see change?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I like the speed at this point of everything. Network connections, you know? I started out with a 300 baud modem. I like how fast everything is and I like how fast everything&#8217;s changing. It&#8217;s part of what keeps the job interesting. I&#8217;m essentially in school every day, learning new things and having to keep my brain working and not just repeating the same patterns. As I said earlier, I will often leave a job when I feel like I&#8217;m just doing the same thing over and over again. It&#8217;s actually to me somewhat more stressful. You think it&#8217;d be stressful learning new things, and it is. There&#8217;s always that feeling of, &#8220;I should be better at this,&#8221; but it&#8217;s more stressful to feel like you&#8217;re just grinding away on the same thing indefinitely. The way that the world keeps changing is wonderful to me because I&#8217;ll never get bored. I might get bored on a particular teams, on a particular task, at a particular company, but there will always be something new and interesting out there, hopefully at the same company because I don&#8217;t really like changing jobs. If not, then certainly at another one. I think it&#8217;s unfortunate that some of the things that are really nice—It used to be we were kind of looked down on as engineers. We were weird, we were not socially apt, we worked with computers, which were scary, or at best, really irritating to people. The IBM at the office where everything&#8217;s always crashing and it&#8217;s blue screen of death all the time, and people hated computers. The web came out and people started to use it. Suddenly, everybody&#8217;s using computers. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, this is cool. This is what I wanted to see.&#8221; I felt like that from the very beginning. Actually my very first class was back east at Wellesley and the instructor was a guy from Stanford who was a visiting instructor there. The first thing that I remember him showing us was, he logged into his account at Stanford and showed us the weather in California. Of course that made me horribly homesick.  because it was freezing in Massachusetts already and it was really delightful in California. But I was also like &#8220;Oh my God, you&#8217;re in California. You&#8217;re standing here in Massachusetts but you&#8217;re in California. That is so cool.&#8221; And that&#8217;s always how I thought about computers, you know, was as a way to communicate and a way to draw people together in some sense, to take away the distance. And that was maybe more of an issue for me because we moved so much and I always lost touch with people because, you know, you&#8217;d go away and I mean, especially if you&#8217;re a kid, you don&#8217;t travel back to see somebody who lives in another state the way you might when you&#8217;re out of college and you have friends or whatever. So I&#8217;d just lose touch with people all the time. This was a way to talk to people all over the world, to get different viewpoints, to talk about anything for people who felt—one of the cool things about Usenet was that people who&#8217;d felt really alone and different in their little community could find people in the larger world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So now another, I guess it&#8217;s—wow, 20 years down the line since the web came out. Everybody&#8217;s seen that, right? Everybody&#8217;s feeling that. So the way I felt about computers when I was 16, now everybody feels that way and everybody is able to communicate with different people, keep in touch with people and find things out, look things up. That&#8217;s how I  always felt since the day I touched a computer till now. And now, everybody is that way. I remember [chuckles] when i was 16. People thought I was really weird, rushing home to read my emails all the time. Now, everybody is reading their emails at all moments, or their chats, or whatever is equivalent. So you see, I was not that weird. I was just ahead of my time [chuckles].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The things I don&#8217;t like—now we&#8217;re ridiculously spoiled. It used to be, we were paid decently but not amazingly. We were treated much less well than the sales people. The salespeople made the company money and we didn&#8217;t. They got all the nice stuff and we were stuc in our cubicles. There was not a great deal of respect. Like there was respect definitely, but it was sort of you&#8217;re just another professional. Now, it’s insane. Everybody is pinging you and telling you how great you are, it’s just silly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Actually  that was another thing that was kind of discordant. Before Twitter I was used to a lot of positive feedback. The culture there is more of a culture of negative feedback. You don&#8217;t get a lot of people saying, &#8220;That was really great. Thank you.&#8221; But you do get complaints whenever anything goes wrong. That kind of brings you down. Right? I don&#8217;t expect everybody to constantly tell me how great I am, but I&#8217;d at least like to get general positive feedback of: you&#8217;re doing a good job, I like what you&#8217;re doing, keep it up. It just wasn&#8217;t the culture there and that&#8217;s uncommon. Most places I know engineering managers are pretty good. I think that they realize that we are slightly fragile and need some reassurance that we&#8217;re doing the right thing day to day, however big our egos may be [laughter]. But, unfortunately now, the egos are getting pretty big. Right? I used to say jokingly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see why they&#8217;re so down on us. They do know we run the world.&#8221; Well now they do know we run the world. Unfortunately, that leads to a lot of engineers who have a lot of big egos and expect a lot of really excessive things in the ways of benefits and treatment and perks and everything. I&#8217;m like—in the end we&#8217;re still just another set of professionals doing a job that these days is very popular. But, I remember the days when we were much more negatively viewed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the stereotypes are still there. “Silicon Valley” is one of my favorite shows. It has all the terrible stereotypes and some people, they&#8217;re like, well, I don&#8217;t like it because it goes too far. I&#8217;m like, no, I know all of those guys. I know them. Sure, they exaggerate it a bit for the humor value, but it&#8217;s not unusual to meet people like that still. But they are also not the only people. There&#8217;re plenty of people who have lots of outside interests and can get dates and be social and all, you know? We aren&#8217;t so bewildered by the world as that show depicts computer people, which is nice. It does, however, make it hard to be the old-style engineer who is not so social, not athletic, not interested in sports, not interested in much of anything besides computers and in my case, board games and science fiction, that kind of thing. It used to be practically everybody I met was like that. And now I am more different than I was. The group is less homogenous and that makes it possible also to have pockets of greater homogeneity, which are very different from who I am and that is weird. It&#8217;s probably better on the whole, I just I miss the old days sometimes.</span></p>\n<p><b>Totally.  My last question for you would be, what are some of the biggest lessons you&#8217;ve learned over your time in tech that you would give as advice to folks who are just starting out now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, from a career standpoint, it&#8217;s most important to have friends. I&#8217;ve gotten almost all my jobs through friends. If I haven&#8217;t gotten the job, that way, I&#8217;ve either made friends, real-life friends with people at work or I&#8217;ve hired my friends at the job. Again partially it&#8217;s the people who are the best part of it, but also if you want to know that the place you&#8217;re going to is good, get a reference from somebody who works there. If you want to find a new job, but you don&#8217;t know where to go, ask your friends to refer you. If you don&#8217;t have any friends, well, or any friends in the industry, then you&#8217;re kind of out of luck.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then, as far as while doing work, I think people really need to realize that the housekeeping and maintenance tasks are just as valuable. And if you&#8217;re the one doing them, then you should stick up for yourself and say, this is just as much needed as flashy new feature development. If you&#8217;re not the one doing them you should recognize that you would be a lot more unhappy if someone wasn&#8217;t taking care of all those things for you, and so respect those people. I mean I suppose to get into the gender stereotypes, again, it&#8217;s like mom at home and dad at work in these sort of faux-ideal—because I don&#8217;t think it was ever ideal—but this ideal that people had of someone being home taking care of all those housekeeping tasks—making you food, and cleaning, and laundry, and all of the things that just make your life run more smoothly—is just as important as the person who&#8217;s bringing in wads of money and paying for things.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And I think that engineering has a lot of housekeeping to be done, like a ton, and it&#8217;s not very glamorous. And you can&#8217;t be the one to point and say, &#8220;Oh, yeah, I developed this thing.&#8221; You would just be like, &#8220;Well, you know, I fixed a dozen bugs last weekend so the site kept running, so that was good.&#8221; But people don&#8217;t really appreciate that, and I think—One of the things that I try to do is make sure that people do appreciate that. And then finally, the other thing I think is really important is as people become more senior they should be teaching more and developing less. It’s a constant educational effort to stay good at what you&#8217;re doing, but it&#8217;s not just you educating yourself, but you helping the people around you. Which again, I guess is a little bit of a housekeeping thing. But if you&#8217;re not making your team better then in some sense, what good are you because nobody will miss you. You could be plugged in with another coder the next day, and nobody will care. You&#8217;re going to need to contribute more than just the code.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b></b><b>Okay, so let&#8217;s start from the beginning. Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My dad was in the Air Force from 1960 to 1962-ish, something like that. He was stationed overseas in England. RAF Lakenheath was where I was born. Height of the Cold War. They literally started building the Berlin Wall the day that I was born, so it was just completely crazy to be out there. Then moved back here. His people and my mom&#8217;s people are both from the Bay Area, so I grew up in Sunnyvale from 1963 on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got a chance to see Silicon Valley happening kind of all around us. It was literally apricot orchards when we moved in, and they were tearing down some of them behind us to build another house behind us and all that. Fast-forward all the way to where we are now, and I&#8217;ve seen—I don&#8217;t know—six generations of Silicon Valley happening around me. It&#8217;s been really fun.</span></p>\n<p><b>How did you first get interested in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, growing up in suburban Sunnyvale, basically everybody&#8217;s dad worked for Lockheed or Martin, or one of the other missiles-and-space contractors. When I was a kid, my dad did not. He was a psych major and he was a writer. And he had a hobby store and a bunch of other stuff. He went into tech writing when the hobby shop went belly-up, and he was really talented. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He was able to look at what people wanted to say in writing such that other engineers &#8211; and later on &#8211; end users could actually understand what it was. He wrote the basic programming manual for a bunch of the early microcomputers &#8211; first generation things that people grew up with. So I think he wrote Beneath Apple Pascal for Apple, one of the early TRS-80 books for Tandy, and the Atari 400/800 BASIC programming guide. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was the kid that they got to type in all of the program listings for the Atari 400/800 programming book.  So I got one of the early prototypes and the draft of the manual. And I got to type it all in and make sure it worked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had things to say about the text, and they actually listened to me and put it in. At that point it was kind of like, &#8220;Okay, this is what I want to do.&#8221; And I&#8217;m&#8211; I don&#8217;t know. This is 1978-ish, so I might have been 16 at that point. </span><em>At 16, you don&#8217;t know what you want to do. And having something like this just kind of fall into my lap was really amazing.</em></p>\n<p class=\"body_text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I just kept working on tiny computers.  </span><em>In 1984 I was the guy who swept the floor and took out the garbage for a small software company.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In those days we manufactured floppy disks. We copied the disks, stick on the label, put the disks in the envelop, put the envelope in the shrink wrap, put the shrink wrap on the manual, get the manual out the door &#8230; that kind of software production.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then their phone system crapped out, and I was put in charge of finding a new phone system. And along with the new phone system came a T1 line, and along with the T1 line came the Internet. And I got email working for everybody, and a Gopher server, which let us save a ton of money by downloading files instead of using Federal Express. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And let&#8217;s see, 94-ish, this thing called Netscape suddenly appears about a mile down the road from us in Mountain View, and we put up a Web server and I had half a T1 to just monkey around with.</span></p>\n<p>Again, I was super lucky, but I guess ready to be lucky at the same time.<b>  </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I learned how to work on the internet and build Web sites. I don&#8217;t know, I had an affinity for it and I really enjoyed it and I enjoyed talking to people about it.</span></p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;ve got no computer science degree—I have no degree of any sort. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>I&#8217;ve got absolutely nothing on paper that says &#8220;you should be an engineer.&#8221;</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I spent almost 19 years at this tiny company that later on turned out to be a big piece of WebMD. And then I took a year, tried to go back to college, and it didn&#8217;t work out, but then Yahoo called. And I took it, because I had always loved Yahoo. </span></p>\n<p><em>I was at Yahoo for 5 years, and I really think of it as the college experience I&#8217;d never had. I helped them open up a bunch of APIs, and we invented Hack Day while I was there, plus most of the concepts everybody now thinks of as &#8220;front-end engineering.&#8221;</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Along with a bunch of other people, at Yahoo I went from a webdev to an engineer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then after Yahoo I went to Netflix for about two years.  There I worked on the first iPhone and Android apps. Again, lucky. And in the right place at the right time, with the right kind of ignorance about how impossible it was to build Netflix on a tiny Web browser, so they let me run with it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Netflix a tiny startup, which was later acquired by Yahoo, and after that, Pinterest.  The recruiter called my home phone and I wasn&#8217;t really looking for work, but </span><em>my stepdaughter heard me say &#8220;Pinterest,&#8221; and she started waving at me like crazy from across the room.  &#8220;Pinterest! Yes! Pinterest is awesome! You! Want! To! Work! At! Pinterest!&#8221;</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And they were in town so I walked down and interviewed, and got the job, first person hired to work as a full-time front-end engineer there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, you know&#8211; I don&#8217;t want to minimize the work. There&#8217;s a lot of work, but there&#8217;s also a lot of, I guess, just listening and being available and being open to things.        </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, so I&#8217;m here. It&#8217;s a long story.</span></p>\n<p><b>In the scope of your career what accomplishments are you the proudest of?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s always the thing you&#8217;re working on right now.  </span><em>When I was at Yahoo, I got to work on the front page at yahoo.com which (if you were to total up the page views) was at that point the single artifact that more human beings had read since the beginning of time, the Bible included. And leaving there, I thought &#8220;I&#8217;ve peaked, that&#8217;s it. Nothing I do will ever be that big and that important, and seen by more people.&#8221; </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> But then you go to Netflix and oh my God, everybody loves Netflix so much. And then you go to Pinterest and oh my God everybody loves Pinterest so much.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s the thing that you&#8217;re working on right now, really. I love working on a product that real actual people know about. I don&#8217;t like the business-to-business stuff so much. I think that&#8217;s kind of boring. </span><em>I like to work on a thing that I can show to my mom. </em></p>\n<p class=\"body_text\">My mom&#8217;s 76 years old and I can say to her, &#8220;Okay, see, I made this thing that makes the words &#8220;Pin it!&#8221; appear on the New York Times website, and when you click it you&#8217;re running my code, and I&#8217;m helping you share what you found with your friends.&#8221;</p>\n<p><b>Yeah, I love that. As someone who&#8217;s from a small town, no one really understands what I do now &#8211; or what I did when I was a tech &#8211; that&#8217;s nice to kind of have those brief moments where you work on something that people from home recognize.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s super hard to explain what you&#8217;re doing to build Web sites to people who don&#8217;t also build Web sites. And it&#8217;s really important to understand that because we live surrounded by that stuff, it&#8217;s &#8220;the industry.&#8221;  </span><em>If you live in Hollywood everybody knows what you&#8217;re talking about when you say &#8220;the industry.&#8221;  And the same goes for Silicon Valley this is &#8220;the industry.&#8221; But &#8220;the industry&#8221; is a tiny little dot on the surface of a really huge planet.</em></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. Let&#8217;s go back to the first Hack Day. What was that like?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So there&#8217;s this genius named Bradley Horowitz who is currently VP of everything social at Google.  But he was hired at Yahoo &#8212; I want to say 2004-ish, something like that &#8212; and he was in charge of the part of Yahoo Search &#8212; yes, don&#8217;t laugh, Yahoo used to have its own search, and it was groundbreaking &#8212; that found images and music and video.  And he hired this other guy Chad Dickerson (now CEO of Etsy) to come in and do this thing called Hack Day. (Chad had other duties of course, but the important thing as far as Bradley was concerned was to do Hack Day.) </span></p>\n<p><em>Nobody had thought about what Hack Day really meant. It was totally internal, not a visible outside thing. </em><em>And the first one was the sales and marketing group hack day.</em><b>  </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although I didn&#8217;t work in SMG, my manager at the time said &#8220;This is something you should get in on,&#8221;  because I had this  habit of making something during the week and showing it to an internal mailing list every Friday. And he said, &#8220;You should go do this thing.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I stole a day and I went over to Santa Clara, which is where Search used to be.  And I participated in it and I won an award and I have that award on my desk to this day. It&#8217;s a little gold bowling trophy made by Leonard Lin, with the day hack logo on it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s one of the most important things that ever happened to me.  I won an award for using APIs. It&#8217;s a dumb little technical nerdy thing but&#8211; there are audiences and there are audiences. Showing something that you built in an 8 hour period with everybody else around you sweating away and working on it&#8211; that was out of this world. That was a bit more than 10 years ago, that was early December 2005. We did a quarterly Hack Day and special editions 20 or 30 times while I was there, and during that time in 2006, we did an open one on the Yahoo campus for everyone who wanted, and one later in London. Beck came to Sunnyvale, and played for maybe a thousand people, right there on the lawn. </span></p>\n<p><em>If there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve participated in that actually matters it&#8217;s the idea that making a computer program should be something that is applauded, and recognized, and shown in public. And that&#8217;s an amazing thing, it&#8217;s an art form that didn&#8217;t exist before. And we made that.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Well, Bradley made that, and Chad made that.</span></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s amazing. Etsy Chad?</b></p>\n<p class=\"body_text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes! Chad&#8217;s now the CEO of Etsy. We went out to London for the first international Hack Day in 2007 and it was just amazing walking around with him&#8211; and I must have been up fifty hours straight at that point. Didn&#8217;t sleep on the plane and got in there, and got lost, and finally found the hotel and just as I was going to fall in to bed, phone rings and it&#8217;s Chad. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay we&#8217;re here, we&#8217;re going out, let&#8217;s go!&#8221; And we actually went out, and we were out for half a day more, stomping around Camden Yard and those places.  Chad&#8217;s a good guy. I wish he was having an easier time of it at Etsy, but that&#8217;s life in the big leagues.</span></p>\n<p><b>I feel like you&#8217;re a treasure trove of stories from the earlier dot coms.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I try not to be too old and boring, and the guy who&#8217;s always talking about his stuff, but it&#8217;s important. </span></p>\n<p class=\"body_text\"><em>People have to understand that everything I did was already done before, and everything they&#8217;re doing was already done before. Things progress in a cycle.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everybody feels like they got it first. No one&#8217;s ever had to deal with this before but you know, yeah, they have. My parents in the &#8217;60s, when the Berlin Wall was going up, they were dealing with stressy things too.</span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m curious how that affects your work—there are young folks now who are building things that they believe that they&#8217;re building for the first time, when there was literally the same start-up with a different name, 10 or 15 years ago. That died at some point, and I&#8217;m curious just to know what it&#8217;s like, to be surrounded by that young optimism and enthusiasm, and to know that things come and go.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love the youth and energy. I feed off it, I&#8217;m an energy vampire. It keeps me young working for these guys. I don&#8217;t know. </span><em>If they suddenly said to me, &#8220;Okay, here&#8217;s a group of your fellow 55-year-olds. You have to go work with them from now on,&#8221; I don&#8217;t think I could do it. I really enjoy working with people who have fresh perspectives. It reminds me every day that I need to keep my own perspective fresh, you know?</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I do my best not to teach, not to lecture. A lot of this stuff can&#8217;t be taught, only learned. If people have questions, if people want help, I like to think I can help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve seen amazing repetition. A long time ago, I want to say five, six years ago, I went and got an internet domain called Local Fu. And the idea was I was just going to build a Twitter mashup so people could tweet something important about a local venue, like &#8220;Okay, here&#8217;s how to park in Palo Alto during the day,&#8221; that kind of thing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And like so many of my other internet domains, I got it, and I went and got the @localfu account on Twitter and I kind of messed around with it and got busy and forgot about it and let it go. The domain went out of registration.  And the day after the domain went back into the pool somebody else bought it, and they were immediately doing the exact same thing that I was going to build. And first thing I did is I went and I looked at their Twitter account, and their Twitter account was like @getLocalFu or @myLocalFu or something like that, and one of the first messages was &#8220;If anybody knows who owns the @localfu Twitter account, can you please have them reach out,&#8221; so I just gave it to them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other thing that &#8211; I&#8217;m hesitant to talk about it, there are a lot of people, fine up-and-coming young white boys who just got out of Stanford or Berkeley and they have bright ideas and they attract a lot of VC funding.  They have a disproportionate amount of power in the real universe because they have all this money and they have the attention of power brokers and kingmakers, and they do these really dumb things, like, did you see the billboards that AirBnB bought during the election?</span></p>\n<p><strong>Mm-hmm.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t know, that particular group of people should not have that much access to power in the real world. They build a lot of the wrong things. </span><em>There&#8217;s a lot of apps being built—specifically in San Francisco—and they&#8217;re catering to people who are also building apps in San Francisco.</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  I remember seeing a parody about an app where they would literally come to your house and put the food in your mouth. It&#8217;s like early retirement for hipsters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yesterday, I think, somebody published an article saying &#8220;We can fix the whole prison overcrowding and funding thing. We can take Soylent &#8211; this product that&#8217;s just all your nutrition in a bottle, so you never have to cook &#8211; we can just feed the prisoners Soylent, give them virtual-reality headsets, and pack &#8217;em in like sardines. I don&#8217;t know if you saw that, it was this hilarious thing.</span></p>\n<p><b>Soylent for prisoners?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. And it&#8217;s how we&#8217;re going to streamline the whole prison thing, and not question the whole idea that this many people should be in prison, or that there should be private prisons, or that prisons should actually make a profit.  None of those questions get asked; these are givens.  It&#8217;s the one thing I worry&#8211;I worry about the younger generation. You kids today. [chuckle]</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. I feel similarly. And I&#8217;m, at this point, just a twenty-eight year old photographer. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&#8217;t get me wrong, tech is a blast. I could never do anything else. I could potentially get a job building fences, but tech is the only thing I can really do that&#8217;s worth anything. It&#8217;s the way that everybody can have maximum impact on the largest amount of people&#8217;s lives. Build something amazing that lets people communicate with each other. Let&#8217;s people find things they didn&#8217;t even know existed. It&#8217;s one of the reasons why I&#8217;m at Pinterest. (I&#8217;ve totally drunk the Pinterest Kool-Aid, by the way. I think we&#8217;re the closest thing there is to a way to easily find something you didn&#8217;t actually know you were looking for in the first place.)</span></p>\n<p><b>I agree.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That used to be Google. And Google is not nearly accessible enough to people who don&#8217;t want to learn how to speak Googlish. We don&#8217;t want to learn how to think like a computer.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Yeah. In your experience, I love that you&#8217;re enthusiastic about what you&#8217;re working on, and I&#8217;m curious to know, as someone who&#8217;s seen so many cycles of tech, what is exciting to you in this batch?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We&#8217;ve dropped the cost of entry to nothing. If you were building Yahoo many, many years ago, you had to go to Fry&#8217;s and buy some computers and wire them together and stick in a rack, and then call up AT&amp;T and have them plug all the stuff in. And all of that is gone now. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, a 13-year-old can do it. You can talk to Amazon or Heroku or whoever&#8217;s running your cloud, and pull it together and have something up and running in the space of a Hack Day. </span></p>\n<p class=\"body_text\"><em>The cost of failing used to be 100,000 dollars. The cost of failing is now under a buck. You can fail for free. You can fail as much as you want. I think the lower the cost of failure goes, the easier it will be for people who have no business doing this &#8211; people like me &#8211; to actually give it a shot. I think that&#8217;s the chief difference: this batch of tech can be made by anybody.</em></p>\n<p><b>I love that. Slight segue: You&#8217;re one of several folks I know in tech who don&#8217;t have college degrees at all, and you&#8217;ve done really well for yourself. How has that affected your career over the years, for good and for bad?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got laid off from WebMD after almost 19 years. We basically took over WebMD, and we gradually shut down the entire Santa Clara operation. There were 5,000 people working there when we first started talking to them. And gradually we merged and purged, and then everything got shut down. We were the last little bit left in Santa Clara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;d started as the guy who ran shipping and receiving and stuffed floppies into envelopes to where I was the person running the entire Web-facing front end of the practice management division of WebMD.  Going from that into &#8220;okay, now go find another job&#8221; in an industry that won&#8217;t talk to you at all if you don&#8217;t have a CS degree&#8211; that was a bath of cold water.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I looked and looked and nobody wanted to talk to me. I&#8217;m 42 years old, at the time, and at that point, in 2003, at that point the age discrimination thing hadn&#8217;t really reared its head. It didn&#8217;t really work that way at all. That&#8217;s a thing that started in about 2007, courtesy of Mark Zuckerberg, and I can go into lots of detail on that later if you want.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yes.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What entered into it is, I was not qualified on paper to write C++, which is what people were hiring for at the time. The Web languages &#8212; HTML, CSS and JavaScript &#8212; that was not considered programming at all. That was certainly not considered computer science, and to this day there are lingering questions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I went back to school. I went back to school because the stuff that I worked on wasn&#8217;t considered engineering, and that didn&#8217;t happen until I was at Yahoo. (There was a small group of people that actually made the concept of front end engineering out of nothing at Yahoo. That&#8217;s another great thing that came out of Yahoo.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And I looked, and I looked, and I looked, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Wow, I can sit down and write this stuff, but I didn&#8217;t qualify.&#8221; I seriously would not have been able to convince an engineering recruiting type department that I was someone that they would want to hire. Google was not existent at this point. There really wasn&#8217;t a thing called Google when I was looking. I mean, it was there, but it was four or five guys trying to do something. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I was at San Jose State, trying to finish up a very old bachelors in psychology, and I noticed that there wasn&#8217;t a really good way to study for this stuff. They had put me into a bunch of low-level undergrad courses, you know, Psych I and statistics and things like that. I wrote a thing purely for my own benefit to help me study online, and I opened it up to some of the other people in my classes, and it&#8217;s a commuter college so there are older people in the college, and I ran into some 30, 40 year old people who were in there basically doing the same thing I was. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I said, &#8220;Hey, I made this thing to help me quiz and get ready for this stuff, so if you want to try it out, you can try it out,&#8221; and I gave it to them. What it was, was a collaborative way of generating practice tests. We would just grab questions that had been on various pop quizzes, put them together with three wrong answers and one right answer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then everybody would re-take these quizzes until they were getting perfect scores.  It took the questions that people were missing, and sorted them up to the top. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And what we discovered was when we got to mid-term time, the questions that had sorted up to the top over the course of the semester were all on the mid-term, and we knew all the answers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I ran this thing for three semesters and left San Jose State with a 5.2 grade point average. It was crazy. I got As and A-plusses in everything, and everybody else who had used this thing also got a bunch of As. To the point where, I had the dean of the psych department and some professors gather me into an office and say, &#8220;We have to talk about this thing that you&#8217;ve put online, because it really feels like you might be cheating.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I showed them exactly what it was, and they got to the end of it and they were scratching their heads, and said, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re obviously not cheating. You&#8217;re doing very well, but everybody else who is using it is also doing really well, and it&#8217;s kind of breaking the curve for everyone else in the class who isn&#8217;t using it.  Can you do us one favor and take it down at the end of the semester?&#8221;  And I did that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But when Yahoo called, I  actually had something to show them.  Now, keep in mind they were paying $70,000 a year or something like that, which was approximately half of what I made the last year at WebMD. But it was like, &#8220;Sure. Absolutely. I&#8217;ll jump in and do it.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, I think in a very real sense not having the college degree actually got me the job. Because I wouldn&#8217;t have been doing what I was doing, and I wouldn&#8217;t have something verifiably useful to show them. Does that make sense? That&#8217;s very roundabout and weird.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, no. It reminds me&#8211; I actually want to pull it up. There was a quote that I saw on Twitter that stuck with me recently. It said, &#8220;My career only makes sense in hindsight.'&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. Yes, that&#8217;s exactly right. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Me, I have a career because people wrote books. I have a career because there&#8217;s a thing called O&#8217;Reilly books. They make books for people who make websites. I had a career because of the Perl Book and the PHP book, and the Javascript book. I have a career because of Douglas Crockford, who worked at Yahoo. He was there when I was there, and he wrote a book called Javascript: The Good Parts. I looked at that, and it finally started to click and make sense for me. Up until then, I was a Web monkey. I was doing what they told me to do, and I would type in the tags and see if it works. It was all very guess-and-check. I wasn&#8217;t doing original programming, at least not using Web tech, until then. It&#8217;s all those guys. It&#8217;s those guys, and it&#8217;s getting lucky, and it&#8217;s working hard, and it&#8217;s being ready for things.</span></p>\n<p><b>I am so intrigued by the fact that you can identify the moment when ageism became the thing.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s easy. </span><em>Ageism began when Mark Zuckerburg said the famous words, &#8220;Young people are just smarter.&#8221; </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It was a large plenary lecture for a bunch of people at Stanford, plus the Y Combinator people. If you look at the people who were in the audience, there were eight companies at Y Combinator, and I believe seven of which are still in business and several of which are now public. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can see a direct correlation between what Zuckerberg says and how they do things at companies like Dropbox. Dropbox is famous for the bro culture, and &#8220;you need to be 22, and you need to drink, and you need to be white, and you need to go, go, go, go, go, and there&#8217;s no life outside of work, and you need to live right there and you need to come drinking with them every night, and for God&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t be a woman, you won&#8217;t fit in.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of that stuff comes right out of that one silly lecture that he did. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the goofy thing is, Zuckerberg (now at the ripe old age of 31) still has yet to retract it. I have never seen where he has actually said, &#8220;hey, you know, I was 22 when I said that, and maybe I didn&#8217;t have all the perspective I could have possibly had, and you know, upon reflection, I no longer believe that young people are &#8216;just smarter.'&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I mean, he&#8217;s massively successful. He was a 22 year old billionaire, and of course, he&#8217;s going to stand up and say what he says, but look at that.  &#8220;Young people are just smarter.&#8221; If you were to substitute the word &#8220;white&#8221; for &#8220;young&#8221; you would get rocks thrown at you, and for good reason.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. So how have you felt the ripples?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have personally never run into ageism in the workplace, but that&#8217;s because I think I have a talent for jumping out before they&#8217;re tired of me. I have these little mini-careers. I&#8217;ll have a nine-month career. At Yahoo I had five different careers. I was always looking for something I could lateral into that might potentially get me some more money at Yahoo. At Netflix I had a couple of major things. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Pinterest I&#8217;ve basically been doing the same sorts of things since the day that I was hired, but I think it was because we were such a tiny company, and you could basically pick out what you wanted to do and work on it. I&#8217;ve just kept working on it for the entire time that I&#8217;ve been here. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But </span><em>I know lots of people who can&#8217;t get hired. If you work on Linux and Apache and MySQL and PHP, you may be labeling yourself as a dinosaur.  If you don&#8217;t have a pretty solid looking GitHub profile, if you&#8217;re not actively contributing to open source, if you&#8217;re not making something new that other people are actually working on, working with and using, that&#8217;s the kiss of death. </em></p>\n<p><em>They&#8217;re going to find somebody who is younger and cheaper. They&#8217;re going to find somebody who does not know that he should not be working those 14, 16, 18 hour days. </em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I mean, you already know you shouldn&#8217;t do that, it&#8217;s terrible for you. It&#8217;s eventually terrible for the company. These guys who are 22, they&#8217;ve just been handed millions of dollars by the VCs, they&#8217;re going to find some 21-year-olds, you know, who can be counted on to just work and work and work  until the money runs out or there&#8217;s a pivot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do you feel that, aside from sheer experience, how your time in tech and your perspective brings something to the table in your work? </span></p>\n<p><em>I think as we get older we become much better pattern recognizers. Your brain cells die off as you get older but the connections between the brain cells become more and more complex. </em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your executive function is generally more in charge and what I&#8217;ve noticed with experienced people&#8211; are you familiar with Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s theory of Ten Thousand Hours of Practice?</span></p>\n<p><b>Yep.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s actually a really good way of thinking about it. People who are experienced, especially in software, especially running big projects in software, you can explain what you want to people like this and they can immediately give you a quick yes or no, and tell you whether something like this is a good idea to even try. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key is, you have to phrase the question in the right way to actually get an explanation that makes sense. You don&#8217;t really want a yes or no. What you want is a, &#8220;Yes and here&#8217;s how we&#8217;re going to do it.&#8221; The flat “no” is never useful, you never give a flat “no.” People hate that. </span></p>\n<p><em>What I think older and more experienced people are better at is immediately saying, &#8220;Okay, if you insist on doing it this way, here are the pitfalls your architecture is likely to fall into.&#8221; And when you pick somebody up who&#8217;s got that kind of experience it&#8217;s exactly as if you&#8217;ve handed the problem to someone who has no experience, they&#8217;ve worked on it for six months, they&#8217;ve made all the mistakes, learned all the learnings and then they&#8217;ve gone backwards in time to the instant when you ask them to do the product and then say &#8220;here are the things we&#8217;ve learned.&#8221; You get that free with someone who actually has the experience</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>.</em> Does that make sense?</span></p>\n<p><b>If you look back on the span of your career, are there any major lessons learned that just really stand out to you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Very few regrets. I would not be sitting in this chair having this conversation with you if anything had gone differently. I like to think that I could have listened harder, been more aware that things were going bad at various points in the career. I mean making that sideways dodge into this-or-that mini-career a little bit sooner in a couple places might have been better smarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I certainly don&#8217;t regret not going to college and grinding my way through a computer science degree in 1983 which would have been totally useless for anything I&#8217;m doing right now.  I&#8217;ve no regrets on that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don&#8217;t know.  I do wish that I had listened harder to some well-meaning people that have talked to me throughout my entire career. </span><em>People have offered me great advice and I&#8217;ve just been too stupid, too busy, too old, too set in my ways to actually listen to it. I wish I had listened more.</em></p>\n<p><b>And lastly, what advice would you give to folks who are hoping to get into tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First of all, be aware of what&#8217;s already happening around you—what you can do without money or a college degree. Don&#8217;t listen to anybody who says, &#8220;If you spend $10,000, I will give you the equivalent of the college degree or golden ticket,&#8221; or whatever it is. You could probably just jump in, jump in and start running at yourself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find the change you want to see in the world. It&#8217;s old advice, it&#8217;s the same advice. Find something that&#8217;s busted, that makes you angry, that you want to fix. Go fix it, go make it better. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Listen to people, listen up. But I guess if you want to fix ageism in technology, ageism&#8211; I don&#8217;t know, I thought for a while I was going to be the poster boy for ageism in tech&#8211; in, actually, electronic stuff, and I don&#8217;t want to do that to my personal brands. I don&#8217;t think ageism is a fixable problem, but I do think that basic diversity in tech is a fixable problem. We can easily get more women in tech. We need more women senior engineers, more women founders, more women money, more women CTAs, and underrepresented minorities as well. All of those people need better representation, and if we can fix those problems &#8211; which are fixable problems &#8211; you can hire 22-year old women, you can hire 22-year old men, and people from underrepresented segments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This advice is especially important for people who want to build consumer products. </span><em>If you&#8217;re not building a thing that 100% of the population of the world will eventually use and love, you are aiming too low. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>And if the people who build your product don&#8217;t genuinely represent that population, you will never be able to reach them and your product will inevitably fail.  If your founding team is a bunch of 22-year-old white male Americans, you&#8217;re already at a huge disadvantage and you must take immediate steps to overcome it.</em></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. I want to dig deeper in that for a second. Just based on your experience, having worked with many different teams and seeing how teams change over time, what have been the benefits that you see of incorporating diverse employees into product work, into the company?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I do the same talk at every Hack Day that I&#8217;m invited to present at.  The talk is always &#8220;How to Win at Hack Day,&#8221; and I&#8217;m usually speaking to younger people, people who are in middle school, high school, maybe college age. I give them the same piece of advice, and the advice is, &#8220;No matter what you do about the thing that you&#8217;re working on, be sure that you have women on your team. And not one. Have at least two. You&#8217;re going to work together for 8 hours, or 24 hours, or maybe 36, and you need to stay on task. You need good modeling for listening and communication, and it will be magically better if you have women on your team.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But all I can really say is &#8220;It will be magically better.&#8221; It always gets a round of applause from the women in the room, and it works really well.  I say, &#8220;I will tell you this right now. The winning team will have at least two women on it.&#8221;  And 24 hours later, guess what?  The winning team stands up &#8211; it&#8217;s got at least two women. Every time I predict it, it happens. It&#8217;s magic.</span></p>\n<p class=\"body_text\">",

I didn&#8217;t go to a fancy school in Mexico, didn&#8217;t have any connections when I first moved, my English wasn&#8217;t perfect&#8230;so naturally it&#8217;s been a lot of hard work to adapt, but it&#8217;s been also exciting and the best decision I&#8217;ve made so far.</p>\n</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b>Let&#8217;s start from the beginning. Tell me all about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m from Monterrey, Mexico. About three hours away from the border of Texas, and I basically grew up on the internet. That’s mostly where I come from. The internet has been part of my life and education since about age eleven. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I knew that I wanted to be a designer when I was thirteen, but I didn’t know how to make that happen. However, I was subconsciously an early adopter of services like DeviantArt, MySpace, Flickr, then later Tumblr, Reddit&#8230;I think these were the major turning points in my life, because during all my teen years I was inspired by the work of others, and it made it clear to me that I wanted to be part of this online awesome community. So I started drawing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I tried two career paths before graphic design. Industrial Design and Visual Arts. I didn’t like either, so I decided to give graphic design a try. I fell in love as soon as I worked in Adobe Illustrator for the first time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I was in college I was also working on my illustration and stationery brand, sharing my work online, and taking on freelance projects. That really helped me find my career path. I was not only looking, I was sharing my own work and making money from it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2013 I attended my first </span><a href=\"http://www.sxsw.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SxSW</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and that helped me understand tech much better and made me realize that I wanted to work in this industry and learn as much as I could from it. I started saving money to move to San Francisco. I thought I’d give it a try for a few months, and so I moved in September 2013. I was still blogging and sharing my work a lot, basically “self-publishing”, and I was really lucky to be featured on </span><a href=\"http://baladycreatives.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Badass Lady Creatives</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. They’re an amazing blog for upcoming female creatives, and that’s how the team at </span><a href=\"https://www.side.cr\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sidecar</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found me.  They called me for an interview, and that became my first job in SF.</span></p>\n<p><b>I love it. What were your preconceptions or expectations about Silicon Valley and what was it like getting here? Was it what you expected? What was different than you expected?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I didn’t have as many expectations as I had fears. It wasn’t until I got here that it hit me that “this is San Francisco!” where, like, the internet lives. It was really challenging at first, from doing an interview in English, to negotiating salary etc.. I was also really scared of being rejected, as a freelancer you get to choose your clients most of the time. It was also my first “real world job” as a designer, and the fact that I didn’t go to a Stanford-like college and didn’t have connections definitely made the whole process of getting a job really challenging. But in the end, I realized that everyone comes from a very different background. Maybe it’s just my personal experience but I see more diversity than when I first moved here, both in the city and at events that I attend.</span></p>\n<p>As a designer I don’t think I have less attractive salary offers than my male peers, but all the women I’ve known do work extra hard in order to gain credibility. It’s hard to stand up for ourselves, maybe more so than getting paid equally.</p>\n<p><b>I can totally relate in my experience when I was in tech. What else have you noticed either in your own experience or around you being both a female and an immigrant working in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an immigrant, I used to feel this pressure that my English had to be as perfect as any American. Especially coming from Monterrey and the kind of society that they are, everyone’s expected to speak perfect English. It’s really intimidating to think of that as the expectation, but when I moved here I realized that people come here from all over the world and everyone speaks their own version of English.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think it’s really valuable for companies to be as diverse as possible on their teams because we all understand different cultures and come from different backgrounds. I know a lot of places that appreciate that enormously. I also think that California is a really warm and friendly place to work. No one has ever made me feel like I’m less for being Mexican. If anything, people really like that, they’re really curious about knowing different places to travel to, different cultures, and I think some startups here have really embraced that about the local culture.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, I love that. Tell me more about getting a cancer diagnosis while getting a job offer from Uber and how that&#8217;s changed your life, and how that impacts your priorities now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, it was terrifying, and I definitely had to rearrange my life. It made me realize that as a young society we tend to overlook our own health. I had a rare form of breast cancer when I was 19, so I didn’t link the back pain that I was having to cancer at all. I’d comment on it for months, and everyone seemed to think it was normal: my fiance’s back hurt, my friends’ back hurt, my therapist’s back hurt&#8230;it seemed like everyone was experiencing something similar, but it wasn’t until I went to get an MRI done that we realized it was the same cancer but in a different area. Thankfully it didn’t spread anywhere else and it’s only on my hipbone area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This chaos happened exactly when my life and career were just changing. I was traveling to Mexico and dealing with a bunch of different doctors, while also negotiating and signing this job offer that I ultimately had to reject when I got the diagnosis. I was really excited about what was coming for me, my career, and my partner. We were both getting new exciting jobs, had plans to move out of our studio apartment, and we just had to pause those plans for a while. It was so surreal, and blurry, and heartbreaking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, I’m a little glad that I had the opportunity to pause everything because I hadn’t stopped working basically since I got my first job in 2008. The closest to a vacation had been when I first moved here in 2013&#8230; to get a job, haha. My priority right now is myself, my family, and then my career, which was hard to accept because I love my career more than anything, but sometimes you just need to stop and appreciate everything else. That’s how I’m looking at it now because I really needed a break.</span></p>\n<p><b>What have been your biggest struggles? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was younger, my biggest struggle was to recognize myself as a designer and be able to talk to people about my work or their work. I’ve always been a little too socially anxious. When I moved here, I had to do the same in a different language, which was extra hard because I felt like I’d lose some credibility if I didn’t speak perfectly, which is not true in most cases.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lately, it’s been to accept that I’m not going to be as productive as I was a year ago, which is stressful because my head is never not working. However it’s enabled me to go back to old habits that I lost when I moved here, like reading, sketching, or as simple as watching TV shows.</span></p>\n<p><b>Have you had mentors or people you’ve looked up to for inspiration along the way?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always. I try to go as far as possible for inspiration: distance, time, or discipline. Bruno Munari is my favorite for design insights. Vignelli has a mind blowing design legacy. I don’t think I’ve ever had mentors, but I feel like everyone that inspires me has mentored me in a way. </span></p>\n<p><b>What are your biggest motivators?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Constantly learning and growing.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do your friends and family feel about the work you’ve done?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t think most of my friends, let alone family, fully understand what I do at work. They know that I’m an illustrator and I try to make it simple for them, so most of them think I just draw for a living, which would be awesome, but I don’t. It wasn’t until </span><a href=\"https://www.uber.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uber</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"http://www.gm.com/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GM</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> started happening that they were like “look at you with your real job!”</span></p>\n<p><b>What do you think about the state of tech in 2016?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like any industry, tech is hard to understand, and as tech workers we’re constantly figuring things out. Tech is so unpredictable, you could spend weeks doing research on a project that at the end will be shut down, or you could spend just a week solving one problem and it will have a huge impact. It’s hard because everyone wants to be in their own world, but we also need human interaction, but that means you’re slightly less productive. I think we’re still trying to get to that balance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Projects like </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Brain\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Brain</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are so mind-blowing and so positive, it really gives me hope and makes me excited for future generations. I always wonder things like “what is Google Brain, or VR, going to look like in 20 years?”, “How are we going to utilize these resources in 100 years from now?” or “How’s the health industry going to be impacted by this?”. People are working on amazing things, and I can go on with at least 10 other super interesting tech projects. I guess my point here is that tech doesn’t always mean apps and business and sucking people’s lives into feedback loops for money. When my friends are interested I always tell them about projects they’re less likely to hear about on traditional media. I think everyone should be informed about this stuff because tech is changing people’s lives in positive ways more than negative.</span></p>\n<p><b>What do you love the most about working in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love that I get to create a universal form of communication that works on every platform, and for most people in the world. I love creating systems that will lead to a functional visual experience that people enjoy. As a designer, the biggest concern 50 years ago was how to make your visual system work in different mediums. Now it’s how to make it work in different screens, cultures, languages, and mediums. I think it’s awesome that we’re moving so fast that we’re constantly learning as we go.</span></p>\n<p><b>What would you like to see change?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The perception most people have about “techies”. We are definitely not millionaire magicians with big egos who believe we’re all changing the world. Things are constantly changing. As tech workers we’re just using technology as a resource to make small improvements to our work and our lives. It’s very much a culture of change, where nothing is sacred and someone is always going to come along and try to improve what already exists. Most of my friends and coworkers live in small spaces, work on small projects, and have a relatively small budget. The real magic of tech is that we’re a culture of constant self-improvement.</span></p>\n<p><b>How do you think your background and life experiences impact the way you approach your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up online has given me the opportunity to learn from a friendly, and disciplined design culture that I got very much into, even before I got to work in tech, so work feels like an extension of the online world I already knew. </span></p>\n<p><b>So what are you working on right now, either for work or for yourself? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sidecar was acquired this year and I’m currently a product designer at General Motors. I think it’s exciting that GM is expanding the way that they are, and I’m happy to be part of their technology team. I’m also doing a collaboration with a Mexican fashion brand. It’s the first time I’ve done anything in fashion, so it’s really exciting!</span></p>\n<p><b>Where do you see yourself in 5 or 10 years? Do you think you’ll stay in tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t know where I’ll be, but tech is part of our lives. This industry is also constantly changing and never ending, and so are our lives, so I’d love to stay in tech but I’d like to explore other fields like education or health, and how they can be improved with technology.</span></p>\n<p><b>For my last question—I know you have lots share because you have written posts on this—but what advice would you give folks to similar backgrounds to you who are hoping to get into tech?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t be afraid to showcase your work. Be part of the online community, I think that&#8217;s really important, or at least it has been for me. I was at Barnes and Noble last weekend and we were reading this programming book from 2015 and my fiance&#8217;s like &#8220;this is already outdated&#8221;. I love magazines, I love analog mediums, but they&#8217;re never going to move as fast as the ones online. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, take advantage of all the </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IRL</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> events that happen in a lot of cities for free&#8230;because sometimes we just don’t have a thousand dollars to spend on that cool Design Week, and that’s why events like </span><a href=\"http://creativemornings.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CreativeMornings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.behance.net/reviews\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Behance Portfolio Reviews</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, all the different “meetups” that are happening are so important. They truly are an amazing way to network and meet peers without having to spend so much money and time.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "interview_content": "<div class=\"post-border\"></div>\n    <p><b></b><b>Why don&#8217;t we start from the beginning? Tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I grew up in Orange County, California. My parents are from Taiwan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My parents signed me up for lots of extracurricular activities: Girl Scouts, lots of team sports like softball, dance classes, Chinese School&#8230; I realized I was terrible at tumbling and dance, but okay at sports and especially enjoyed the team aspect of softball, cross-country and track. </span></p>\n<p><b>Were you into tech at all?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah—it was also in high school that I started making really simple websites for friends running school clubs. I learned how to make the most basic websites. My code was pretty bad, as I found out later. Some girls would look at my code and make fun of it. [laughter]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I got to college, the friends I made referred me to paid webmaster gigs at their campus organizations. Getting paid to be a webmaster and web designer was an awesome concept. So I had–amongst my many jobs in college–work experience in making websites. When I graduated four years later with a social welfare and english degree, I looked at Craigslist and tried some gigs. </span></p>\n<p>My first job out of college was found on Craigslist—<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I joined as a web producer on the engineering team a VC-backed startup in Palo Alto. I was employee number nine at this company, and was with them until they grew to 50 people or so. Having just moved from Berkeley to Palo Alto, I was starting to understand what what entrepreneurship was. I reconnected with a friend from college organizing entrepreneurship events and conferences on the Stanford campus, so he recruited me to make websites, the program and schwag for his entrepreneurial activities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went to the events he’d host and ask, “Why are there no women speakers?&#8221; He recognized the problem introduced me to some other women who asked similar questions, and we put our heads together to organize a conference of women entrepreneurs. </span></p>\n<p><b>Was that the impetus for founding Women 2.0?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We decided in 2005 that we wanted more women to be on TechCrunch, to be starting companies, to be growing them, and to be ambitious and do things in tech. We started meeting regularly as <a href=\"http://women2.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Women 2.0</a> to bring together women that wanted to start things. We grew the organization and programs over time, such as an annual business plan competition with culminated in a conference with an investor pitch night.  Women 2.0 was a side project, while we worked various jobs in startups. I left engineering after two years because I realized that when people talk about engineering, they get very passionate about clean code, efficient code, and they start quibbling about that. My personal philosophy is simple, &#8220;I just want to make things” and I heard that product management was “like being a mini-CEO” and a step closer to the entrepreneurship path.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I went to the events he’d host and ask, &#8216;Why are there no women speakers?&#8217; He recognized the problem introduced me to some other women who asked similar questions, and we put our heads together to organize a conference of women entrepreneurs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got my first job as a product manager in San Francisco, and was laid off right as the economy collapsed, spending many months in and out of employment. All along the way, I would always organize a Women 2.0 event and write a blog post about my thoughts on women starting companies. I shared their stories on the Women 2.0 website. I began writing what we now refer to as &#8220;listicles” &#8211; saying, &#8220;These are executive startup/entrepreneurial women that you should know.&#8221; And I would be surprised at how often they would get picked up and carried forward, so I think people were really encouraged. I&#8217;d hear that my name tied with Women 2.0 coming into women’s inboxes made them really happy that hope for life outside a boring cubicle existed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It helps people to know that we are not alone in ambition. I also wanted to join Girl Geek Dinner events in the Bay Area, as I had seen on the internet that in London there are these things called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Geek_Dinners\" target=\"_blank\">Girl Geek Dinners</a>, and I always waiting for the series to start in the Bay area, but it kept not happening.  Six months later, I reached out to the founder in London and asked how to make one happen in San Francisco because I was so tired of waiting for someone to start the local series. Then I went to Google and proposed for them to organize the event, which Google agreed to do. We had over 400 signups for the free event in 5 days, and we had to close registrations early due to demand. Google wound up renting a large white tent to help accommodate the crowd outside Charlie’s Café, their largest venue at their headquarters in Mountain View in January 2008. I was asked to give opening remarks and you can find a YouTube video me—really shyly—saying &#8220;Welcome to Girl Geek Dinners&#8230;” [laughing] It was the beginning of my consistently having to go onstage and introduce events that I organized, because this meant I was a “leader.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a leader, you have to rise to the occasion and make remarks onstage. And you see all these smiling faces at you and they&#8217;re all taking out their cameras. There are always a lot of pictures and video and social media about these events. I brought onstage as speakers female VC, a Director of User Experience at Google &#8211; who&#8217;s a woman &#8211; a female entrepreneur, a female developer. A broad panel. The conversation was good.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s what Women 2.0 was about and Bay Area Girl Geek Dinners is about—sharing what we know and our ambitions, so there&#8217;s no information asymmetry. </span>We don’t want make the same mistakes over and over again. We indubitably will make mistakes, but hopefully you always think that you will help someone else by sharing what you know.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve hosted over a hundred Bay Area Girl Geek Dinners and the event series is successful. Renowned. I have to stand up at every event and introduce and welcome the attendees &#8212; &#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Angie. I&#8217;m the founder of Bay Area Geek Girl Dinners. Welcome…&#8221; and make a short statement. It&#8217;s the part I hate the most, and the part where I felt like people seem to really enjoy. They like that I stand and own up to it. I&#8217;ve learned to do introductions and remarks now pretty readily, and I&#8217;ve also given talks on entrepreneurship, startup ecosystems, women in tech and how to move mindsets on diversity. That&#8217;s what Women 2.0 was about and Bay Area Girl Geek Dinners is about— sharing what we know and our ambitions, so there&#8217;s no information asymmetry. </span>We don’t want make the same mistakes over and over again. We indubitably will make mistakes, but hopefully you always think that you will help someone else by sharing what you know.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was hosting Bay Area Girl Geek Dinners, I met the founders of <a href=\"https://hackbrightacademy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hackbright Academy</a> and loved the mission of changing the ratio of women in engineering, and so I joined Hackbight. After realizing when LinkedIn reminded me like, &#8220;You&#8217;ve been at Women 2.0 for seven years,&#8221; like, &#8220;Oh, seven-year itch,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;That&#8217;s a long time,&#8221; I realized that I wanted to work at Hackbright Academy on the problem of getting more women into technology. I joined them really early, and now I work there on the &#8220;business side&#8221; of Hackbright. I say “business” because people think of Hackbright as a school for women. We teach women who have already graduated from college, had started working on another career, and wanted to transition their careers into tech. Oftentimes, they have friends who do it, they have partners who do it, and they want to do it too. So we&#8217;re giving them a way to make a career transition into tech. Granted, you can also learn to code on your own. I know people who have done that, and that takes oftentimes years. What I do at Hackbright Academy is work with the companies that want to hire engineering talent—and we have a lot of them graduating from Hackbright.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The reason why I started thinking I want to start a company was because I went to one meet-up and every guy would give me his business card and be say, &#8216;I&#8217;m the CEO of this company.&#8217; I’d take his business card, go home, put in the URL into the web browser and wonder &#8216;What is this one page website/company? Everyone is the CEO of their dream. Why don&#8217;t I have business cards that say Angie Chang is CEO of this company?'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>In your experience of working on Women 2.0 for seven years now, how much of their collective experiences were something that you experienced, or did it totally opened your eyes to things that you had no idea about? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think there&#8217;s a lot of varying experiences in tech. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re talking to a ton of people who—based on their unique experiences, a combination of their age, class, background, race—have anticipated, expected, and experienced many different things. I feel fortunate to be Taiwanese-American and to have had grown up in strong, middle-class family with ambitious parents. I feel very fortunate at the end of the day to be able to do what I do. I do hear about stories and we do work with a lot of students and people that I know that have a lot of anxiety around just rising up in their careers. And I don&#8217;t want to say tech as an industry, but generally speaking, there&#8217;s anxiety in lawyers in tech as well for women that want to transition their careers into engineering. It&#8217;s kind of a 2016 thing, they want to be happy with their jobs and they want to have it all and they look on Facebook and they think someone else is having a good life. I think generally our generation right now, people are less happy. When we look back, we&#8217;re like, &#8220;I should be happy because I have a place to live and I have a fair wage and I have friends.&#8221; But I think there&#8217;s generally a lot more discontent. </span></p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;m noticing in this project the kind of trends of struggles that stand out for everyone, like imposter syndrome, that sort of thing. What are the biggest struggles that seem somewhat universal?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imposter syndrome is a big one for our students. It&#8217;s really helpful to identify it for people. I forget about it because it&#8217;s kind of something I experienced 10 years ago. </span>The reason why I started thinking I want to start a company was because I went to one meet-up and every guy would give me his business card and be say, &#8220;I&#8217;m the CEO of this company.&#8221; I’d take his business card, go home, put in the URL into the web browser and wonder &#8220;What is this one page website/company? Everyone is the CEO of their dream. Why don&#8217;t I have business cards that say Angie Chang is CEO of this company?&#8221;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And run that and go get funding.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Confidence comes with time, and being coachable is a big part of that.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, I can see imposter syndrome in many people, not just women in tech. Having to level to where other people are at is always intimidating if you don&#8217;t feel like you look or fit for various reasons, that you&#8217;re an imposter. So that is something. Successful people have imposter syndrome too. Everyone has imposter syndrome. Having these platforms like Women 2.0 and Bay Area Girl Geek Dinner events and blogs to talk about it and to commiserate. But hopefully, you don’t spend too much time commiserating and be able to achieve small successes at the end of the day is what will inspire other people to join you in the industry, be your awesome coworkers, and not leave tech—which is the other problem people keep talking about &#8211; women leaving the workforce.</span></p>\n<p><b>Did you have support networks growing up that affected you in a way to where it made you want to build support networks for others?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, not really. I do think that I was a Girl Scout and I had to face so much rejection trying to sell Girl Scout cookies in like a supermarket parking lot for hours. I think doing that and sports has made me more competitive and think more like a marathon than a sprint. Confidence comes with time, and being coachable is a big part of that. Also, I feel relatively lucky to not have a lot of mental health issues, which I realize many people do have in this day and age. So those are things that I feel fortunate not to have personally. There are many anxiety issues, depression, and other factors that are inhibiting people’s ability to continue working.</span></p>\n<p><b>How has your experience been as a female entrepreneur, or just entrepreneur in general?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have to have a thick skin because, sure, if you are working in any field dominated by men, you have a high likelihood of experiencing an amount of discrimination and/or sexual harassment, as recent studies/surveys have shown. </span>I think you have to have an end goal in mind to continue to work.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I&#8217;m with the very determined people to be like, &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m not going to let this stop me, though,&#8221; and figure out ways around it and mobilize people and like-minded people to figure it out together. I find that talking to people is very helpful and doing it at scale, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been trying to do, is bring people together to help them figure out for themselves. I think that&#8217;s what <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Sandberg\" target=\"_blank\">Sheryl Sandberg</a> means by launching <a href=\"http://leanin.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Lean In</a> and encouraging women to start their own circles. She means well; she wants people to get together and have support networks.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think you have to have an end goal in mind to continue to work.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Over your career, have you had people within the industry that you looked up to for inspiration or people that were pivotal in your growth?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2006, there were very few women that blogged, but there were a small handful like <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/christineherron\" target=\"_blank\">Christine Herron</a>, who&#8217;s a VC. There have been some women that had been visible, and they used to write blog posts every so often, but I can see who they were. <a href=\"http://caterina.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Caterina Fake</a> was on the cover of Newseek or something for Flickr, looking like she was having a ton of fun. I see those every now and then. The cover of Wired had <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limor_Fried\" target=\"_blank\">Limor Fried</a> posing in a “We can do it&#8221; kind of way—and she sells hardware and electronic maker items from her <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Adafruit</a> company based in New York, she&#8217;s really great. Seeing stuff like that always stokes the flames of, &#8220;Yes, we can do it.&#8221; Sharing women’s stories of entrepreneurship and leadership have been validating. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So when I was younger and looking at the blog posts for guidance and inspiration, I realized I wanted to pass it forward and do the same – share my stories and find like-minded people. That&#8217;s why I spend a bit of time venturing to put out blog posts. If I learned something, I would blog it as a way to synthesize the situation in my head and be able to restate very simply what the points were. Because I have a really terrible memory, I take lots of notes on Evernote.</span></p>\n<p><b>What do you think are your motivators? What drives your work?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think, like many people, we just want to have more women in positions of power, leadership, in technology… Women as players in building tech, working in tech. As someone who works in tech, I would like to have more women at the table. </span>You see gender parity walking down the street and then you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Why is it once I enter this room it&#8217;s all 20-year-old white and Asian guys?&#8221;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So, to that effect I think many of us do want to see the workspaces change and also hopefully to have better projects and business results and more interesting day-to-days.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You see gender parity walking down the street and then you&#8217;re like, &#8216;Why is it once I enter this room it&#8217;s all 20-year-old white and Asian guys?'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>What do you feel like—in terms of diversity—tech companies are doing okay at right now? And what feels like the obvious next step?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think&#8211; it&#8217;s really hard to regulate across companies. I would love for there to be quotas and stuff but I can&#8217;t imagine them actually happening in the United States yet. I do think, as companies grow, they are able to hire HR and start being accountable to having certain metrics for hiring and retention of non-traditional employees. Slack and Pinterest are companies with plenty of capital to hire a lot of people working at this problem.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I have been worried that there have not been enough women leaders emerging in the last few years. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wish more women would start growth companies and killer event series to rally smart people.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><b>How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? What really excites you about the future, or frustrates you?</b></p>\n<p>I have been worried that there have not been enough women leaders emerging in the last few years. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wish more women would start growth companies and killer event series to rally smart people. Grace Hopper Celebration is great and brings together thousands of female engineers, and there should be more events and organizations that do that.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I work on convincing companies and engineering leadership and hiring managers to consider non-traditional schools as well as non-traditional people. Companies say they want diverse candidates, and we have them in spades. They&#8217;re all really smart.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a way, Bay Area Girl Geek Dinners is a lightweight way to work on changing the ratio – similar to my job which is at Hackbright Academy working with companies looking to hire engineering talent that isn’t Stanford or Berkeley or University of Waterloo. It’s hard work getting companies on board to recruit from a women&#8217;s coding school because the entire coding bootcamp movement has only been around for four years. </span>I work on convincing companies and engineering leadership and hiring managers to consider non-traditional schools as well as non-traditional people. Companies say they want diverse candidates, and we have them in spades. They&#8217;re all really smart. <b> </b></p>\n<p><b>Yeah. Tell me more about these girls like, where are a lot of them coming from, what are their first impressions of Silicon Valley, how are they feeling?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hackbright engineering fellows love the work spaces. Companies have free food, oftentimes, and snack bars and unlimited drinks in the kitchen. What we do at Hackbright is work to expose our students to a range of companies &#8211; small, medium, and large companies of varying shininess. Because we find that a lot of our graduates are really happy at places like <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SurveyMonkey</a> and <a href=\"http://newrelic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">New Relic</a> that don&#8217;t have the same brand-name recognition as Facebook and Uber. Not many people will say “I want to work at a survey company” or “I want to work at a developer tools company” but those are actually some of the better places to work at, because they have engineering leadership. In the case of SurveyMonkey, Selina Tobaccowala&#8217;s the CTO. At New Relic, the SVP of Engineering is Darin Swanson. They&#8217;ve both been working with Hackbright since day one and recruiting from us steadily for the last four years, and have been cycling back to tell us what&#8217;s worked and what hasn&#8217;t so we can share that information with other people. Our students are educated through mentorship and field trips to our hiring partners. Our mentors are all working software engineers who actually run that program at Hackbright, where we enlist every quarter. For each student, they get three mentors who are working as engineers in the tech industry. Hackbright mentors are 60% men, 40% women. They donate their time &#8211; an hour a week &#8211; for the course of the program. It&#8217;s a really good way to bring people in and actually meet a woman engineer. There are a lot of guys out who have expressed that they do not enjoy the gender ratio in engineering and want to help. It&#8217;s their quiet way of coming to Hackbright, getting trained on how to work with a new engineer that&#8217;s a woman. The mentors learn to slow down and talk to the new female engineer, hear her anxieties, help her with her code. Basically, be her champion and cheerleader. After mentoring for a few months, we have Hackbright mentors bringing their colleagues and company to Career Day – Hackbright’s premiere recruiting event for companies looking to expand their engineering team with diverse engineering talent.</span></p>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s amazing—just the idea of the amount of empathy and value as a manager that provides to a man who doesn&#8217;t necessarily have experience interacting with young female engineers.</b></p>\n<p>A lot of our mentors come in, they say things like, &#8220;I have a daughter. I want to learn how to make the world better for her,&#8221;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and also there are a lot of people that just want to help out. It&#8217;s been really great to hear their stories. </span></p>\n<p>You know that XKCD comic where a guy is bad at math, and the thought is “he is bad at math.” But if a woman is bad at math, the thought is &#8220;women are bad at math.&#8221; I feel like the same happens for women in engineering. I feel like that sometimes people meet a coding school graduate and evaluate her. &#8220;Oh, she didn&#8217;t meet the bar. All women are not going to meet the bar.&#8221;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  That’s really unfortunate because it’s just that one woman who didn’t meet that bar that time. It’s not all women. But it seems that people judge all women as the same and let their biases get in the way of giving women a chance to succeed.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;A lot of our mentors come in, they say things like, &#8216;I have a daughter. I want to learn how to make the world better for her.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>That&#8217;s so interesting. It&#8217;s just strange, strange logic.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Definitely happens.</span></p>\n<p><b>Lots of people are talking about hiring in terms of diversity at the moment. Obviously, a super-hot topic. Slowly more people are starting to talk about retention as well. I&#8217;m curious to hear your thoughts on that.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason why Bay Area Girl Geek Dinners started and why I feel so passionate about continuing it, I think it&#8217;s a really good networking event. Because I feel like one of the things that I saw when I was working was that day-to-day you don&#8217;t see that many women in engineering or tech. So </span>to keep people from burning out, it&#8217;s good to have women-only events. It’s like group therapy, or a support group. It&#8217;s a way to keep women invigorated.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Take for example a recent Bay Area Girl Geek Dinner &#8211; I saw a bunch of Hackbright graduates coming back, hugging their fellow Hackbright, and getting to know more women in tech across different companies and working in different roles. It’s really invigorating. </span>I think it helps feed your soul so that you don&#8217;t burn out and decide to quit and leave the workforce.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You know that XKCD comic where a guy is bad at math, and the thought is &#8216;he is bad at math.&#8217; But if a woman is bad at math, the thought is &#8216;women are bad at math.&#8217; I feel like the same happens for women in engineering.

All parents should exercise their leave. This helps women take their leave, and opens the door for us to have work life balance as an expectation for all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Provide manager&#8217;s training from the very beginning. I&#8217;m not sure what a good answer is because everyone always thinks like, &#8220;Do things earlier.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think it comes down to people, not companies. People&#8217;s mindsets have to change and they have to care and champion for diversity and parity early on. People have to want to be coaches, mentors and supporters of women’s careers in tech.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;So </span>to keep people from burning out, it&#8217;s good to have women-only events.

I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve seen many women &#8211; friends and acquaintances &#8211; transition over those eight years in tech. What have you seen with these women? Have you seen a lot drop out, have you seen a lot move up through the ranks? What are kind of the trends you&#8217;ve seen across women getting into their thirties?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wish more women started a legacy of stuff. For example, I was at a table of women leaders for a tech dinner. The leaders of groups like <a href=\"https://www.womenwhocode.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Women Who Code</a>, <a href=\"https://www.girldevelopit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Girl Develop It</a>, <a href=\"http://www.blackgirlscode.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Black Girls Code</a>. We&#8217;re all sitting around the table, and we do this every year. I realized after a few years that this is still the same table of people. </span>Why are there not new faces around the table? I want competition. And by competition, I mean friendly competition, because it means that we have peers.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I would love to refer to other women in tech events and be excited for their growth and results.</span></p>\n<p><b>What do you see yourself doing in five or ten years?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m not sure. I want to see Hackbright Academy succeed as a women’s engineering school. I think we are in a good place to work on important issues for women in tech, being a women&#8217;s engineering school. I have friends who always say, you should be the CEO. Maybe one day, of something. I enjoy women in politics succeeding and leading as grandparents. This reassures me that I have plenty of time. I&#8217;ve already been a founder several times. Now I&#8217;m an executive. People have told me several times, you should be a CEO of something VC-funded, or go into politics. In good time.</span></p>\n<p><strong>My last question—What advice would you have to a young lady who is interested in getting into tech but doesn&#8217;t know how or doesn&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s possible?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hard thing for people starting out is that, you don&#8217;t know what you don&#8217;t know. So you don&#8217;t know where to start searching. Usually people find their way to <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Codecacademy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Coursera</a> where they learn to code. They can dabble. There&#8217;s many helpful “learn to code” websites that Google, Facebook, et cetera, have put up for the purpose of educating women and people around the world, at their home in Montana, Iowa, Florida, Kazakhstan. They can learn to code online. Now, whether the online course or MOOC course is completed, side project(s) built and the new engineer is able to have the connections to get hired into an engineering job, I don&#8217;t know. That&#8217;s why many people move to San Francisco and the Silicon Valley, and go to coding bootcamps like Hackbright Academy to gain the education and network to succeed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start Googling and learning what you don&#8217;t know. That will put you on a path, and you will soon find that in the world of engineering and building things, there are so many job titles involved. It&#8217;s not just software engineers. There are people that are launching imaging satellites, there&#8217;s hardware, there&#8217;s so many different things that people can learn and do if they went to a Hackathon for a weekend or just dabbled on a project and finished some Instructable about how to make your thirsty plant tweet at you or something. I hope people will just get started and learn how to learn what they don&#8217;t know so they can start learning what’s important. Also, I hope they blog and tweet and share their lessons learned along the way, to help someone else out there. </span></p>",
